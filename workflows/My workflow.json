A persona is a detailed character profile that captures the essence, traits, and characteristics of the person in the video. When I write BEGIN PERSONA CREATION, you will enter this role and all further input will be related to analyzing the transcripts and creating the persona.\n\nHere are the steps and important rules for the task:\n\n1. **Understand the Transcripts**: Carefully read the provided transcripts. Note any recurring themes, topics, and specific details mentioned in the videos. Pay attention to how the person speaks, their tone, and any notable personality traits or interests that are frequently highlighted.\n\n2. **Identify Key Information**:\n   - **Name**: Determine if the transcripts provide a name. If not, use a generic placeholder (e.g., \"Video Host\").\n   - **Occupation/Role**: Identify their job, role, or what they are known for based on the content of the videos.\n   - **Interests/Hobbies**: Note any interests or hobbies mentioned.\n   - **Personality Traits**: Look for descriptions or implications of their personality (e.g., humorous, serious, enthusiastic).\n   - **Values/Beliefs**: Identify any values or beliefs expressed.\n   - **Demographics**: Include any information on their age, gender, location, etc.\n\n3. **Organize Information into a Persona Profile**:\n   - Create sections for Name, Occupation/Role, Interests/Hobbies, Personality Traits, Values/Beliefs, and Demographics.\n   - Summarize the information you have gathered in each section.\n\n4. **Maintain Accuracy and Consistency**:\n   - Ensure all information is consistent with the transcripts.\n   - Do not infer or invent details that are not supported by the transcripts.\n\n5. **Format the Persona Profile**:\n   - Use clear and concise language.\n   - Present the information in a structured and readable format.\n\nExample:\n\n<Persona Profile>\n<Name>\nJohn Doe\n</Name>\n<Occupation/Role>\nTechnology YouTuber\n</Occupation/Role>\n<Interests/Hobbies>\nGadgets, software development, gaming\n</Interests/Hobbies>\n<Personality Traits>\nEnthusiastic, knowledgeable, humorous\n</Personality Traits>\n<Values/Beliefs>\nBelieves in the importance of technology education, advocates for open-source software\n</Values/Beliefs>\n<Demographics>\nMale, mid-30s, based in San Francisco, CA\n</Demographics>\n</Persona Profile>\n\nBEGIN PERSONA CREATION\n<transcripts>\n{{ $json.text }}\n</transcripts>\n</Instructions> "

              "text": "hey everyone welcome back to the channel today we have Terrell a member of our community um who's had a huge amount of success with his agency and in this interview I want to break down his success so far how he's been able to go from zero to over $140,000 in the past 6 months um and the strategies he's using to acquire top talent to use referral Partners to continue to make money consistently without needing to do too much marketing on his own and a bunch of other strategies he's used to become Top members and communities like my own so that he's been a of Fast Tracker success so Terrell it's great to have you here and I'm looking forward to to more about your story absolutely thanks for having me man no worries so uh I think first thing to to jump into that everyone really wants to hear is is the the results you've got over the past 6 12 months um so let's start start off with that we can work back from there yeah absolutely so in the last 6 months we've done around $140,000 averaging about $20,000 a month and uh things are really taking off on The Voice AI side of things as well so happy about that MH yeah and and how have you gotten to this point what's the what's the Journey of of Terell and and your team as well I know you've been in the community for probably since we started and we're one of the first people in there and you've continued to make yourself very well known within the community I think that's been a big part of your success um so you want to just walk us back from from your entrance into the space I know you were early to chat TBT but um you've got a really cool story on how you got to this point so I'd like to share that with some of the guys who may may be able to relate to it yeah yeah so I've I've been passionate about the AI space since about 2020 um so chat gpt3 had just came out and I was actually an early access user of chat GB uh or gbt 3 I should say and it was it was amazing it was something that enabled us to uh pretty much automate a lot of our content creation and so that just blew me away with with what the technology could do ever since I've been really addicted to um trying out new AI tools and learning more about the space and so after you you got you said you got early access to that right so that must have been a pretty a pretty interesting experience for you some at the first I mean I thought I was fairly early to it but sounds like you were even um how did that lead you into uh I mean you probably had the same question that myself and many other people watching this had was like yes the stuff was cool this is like really really awesome and I think it's going to change the world but how do I make money from it how do I build a business and it's probably where you ran into either some content from me or other people or you came up it yourself like how did you get to the point of now running an agency and making money from the thing yeah absolutely I mean you're the shiny example I basically came across your videos I was hoping you're going to say someone else but okay good good good no um I came across your videos and I saw that you were doing custom development really inspired me since I have a little bit of a background doing programming so um I was like okay if if you know he's got this thing making money and and he's uh you know offering AI services like maybe there's a way I can do that as well um and so I just kind of consumed a lot of your content brought myself into the community um started networking with a lot of people in the community and you know I'd be looking out for those other success stories I'd be looking out for the people that um you know were talking about their wins doing big numbers and just doing cool stuff and so you originally would have joined the Discord when we had that going right so the Discord and the accelerator came out and jumped in there um I know that at one stage you were doing Dev placements as well so how did you I think that was one of the things you you jumped into on your way to getting where you are now which is doing custom Solutions we can get into it a bit but what's been the journey since you actually decided yes I want to start an agency or some kind of business in the AI space so I had a little bit of background in e-commerce and any Ecommerce company reached out to me for um a decent sized project it was I think it was about a 20K project and they actually need a lot more work after we wrapped up that project and what I realized is one of the best ways that I could help them is by giving them access to some top talent so effectively I helped them hire a few developers and those developers um work directly for them and then I would effectively take a small cut of of that and and those are some very large contracts that they got up to around you know to $100,000 um and so I was very excited about that um since there was just this interest in the space and people actually wanted to hire AI developers um and uh and as we got more into the space I kind of transitioned into doing the the custom Dev projects and that happened because a lot of people in the community needed help with their custom Dev I I started to notice that is a gap in the market there's a lot of people um doing no code and I've helped a lot with no code projects as well but in in uh a lot of people in the community's case they need to have help so I started to help them with some of their custom projects kind of build up my portfolio and then after we had a few projects under our belt um we started partnering with a few members in the community to to Really scale the projects yeah I think this is a really important bit of the conversation to have and that's highlighting the the two sides to the space right now and why I think it's going to be so big moving forward because there's there's L something for everyone if you're starting one of these agencies and it's such a great entry point for not only to make money online dud who are coming in to try to the SI smma and they want to jump into doing Ai and basing the business around AI rather than around marketing but also around developers and people with a a technical skill set who want to get into the market as well so in your case um which we can get into in a second you're specializing on the custom development side and instead of trying to make all the noise and do all the marketing yourself you're saying look I'm just going to make a really good de team find good people and focus on on delivering high quality services and then I'm going to go out to people who probably have an audience like a bunch of the people like we've just had our our Mastermind here for this for AI content creators AAA creators um that I've put together and a bunch of them have have decent personal Brands and they've got a lot of leads coming in but they can't find the technical help but they don't have the the capabilities to to Service as many as possible that is the limiting factors we don't have enough Talent or we don't have enough uh bandwidth to deliv with these services and I'm I really like your positioning of saying hey look I'm just going to go to these guys who have too many leads cuz they I mean if you create content in AI space there's so much attention um if you can just just make yourself look like you know what you're doing and and share some valuable stuff to business owners then you get a bunch of leads in return so um can you walk us through how you got this Partnerships going like how you actually found the people to to get the leads from um and how those Partnerships are working at the moment honestly it was a long journey so I had to build these relationships over time um but it started with me just looking at the top students in your community and building that relationship with them um over time I would follow up on a weekly basis see if they had any additional projects kind of remind them of the stuff that uh we're focused on helping them with and then um over time the leads really started to pump in after we built that trust um so a couple of the couple of the members um like yanis and Mark have have been a tremendous help in the community and uh really enjoyed working with with different people in there yeah now what the there's been a few key moments in my my agency journey and one of them was was hiring a key role in our business which allowed us to like a key lead developer that allowed us to begin to start scaling the services and also for me was bringing on my business partner Josh for for the operations in the saleside so what have been those key moments that you would recommend I mean in your journey and if you had to look at other people's Journeys as well what might be important things to focus on as well because I know you found some pretty key talent and uh if you could tell us a story about that as well that'd be cool oh yeah absolutely so I mean in in your community it it's wild right I was able to not only find the business through partnering with people but I was able to also find the people that would build and become my core team um and so one of the people that I found in the community was the ex- head of engineering of Postman uh the API application that a lot of people use and um yeah I don't know why didn't he hit me up man I was right here we we're always hiring but man that's so good that you snagg that how how did that connection happen and what was it like on boarding them because I know we've had a conversation about hiring hiring and retaining top talent so what are you having to do um to keep him around yeah you know I when it comes to talent I I tend to think of Alex her Mo's quote um create an irresistible offer that someone can't refuse and so really my biggest mission is to figure out what is lacking on their side and what they're trying to develop um and kind of and kind of what their bigger vision is and so his vision was to move into the AI space build some really awesome products and uh partner with someone that had you know previous business experience and things like that and so um you know it took some time to kind of nurture that relationship and build it up he was working on a few different things at the same time when I first started bringing him on but I was able to eventually kind of earn his trust and fully transition him over to the team after a couple months here and so for for people who are early in their agency journey and I struggling with hiring and talent and I mean I I've literally just made a video that if you're watching this right now you'll be able to go and watch that um it's on how to hire your first developer and it's it's so apparent to me now um that yes you can get it get one of these started if if you're technically capable you can get started or even if you don't have a background you can spend a few months learning these tools and how to how to do prototypes and at least get a bit of interest and deliver some small projects but you're never going to scale if you can't find some technical talent and bring in an expertise um because as a business owner you're going to need to be focusing on okay am I making content to attract more leads am i setting up setting up paid traffic funnels Etc you need to be able to step back and work on the business rather than in the business of such a cliche but it's so important for for you as the agency owner and the the analogy that I use is is you're like a like a general in the Army our job is to kind of identify the problem and then deploy the resources to solve that problem um our job as the agency own is not necessarily to be the one on the keys planning everything and architecting it ideally you can bring people in so that you I'm sure you're not like you can tell us a second but I'm sure you're not in there on the keys like coding the sing way because you found the right Talent which is allowing you now to get into content and other areas that's growing the business so um do want just walk us through your position in the business and and how you've changed from how you initially started to to your role now and so you can get into YouTube as well I mean you said it yourself so I actually was bashing the keys originally when I first um started this and and it was really hard I remember just with a couple projects in parallel it was it was somewhat stressful after after I got the first few projects um and and my position kind of changed from okay I have to deliver this project to I just need to focus on bringing more projects once I had the team members in place um so that's how my role has changed and um I would say the the biggest thing with bringing on the top talent is finding a structure that makes sense and so oftentimes you know top talent costs top dollar and so if you can't pay top dollar out of the gate you're going to have to negotiate with some other sort of tool and so I often negotiate with you know like custom Revenue share or Equity agreements and things like that um and so it's a little more advanced but I think um as I learn about those things and kind of going through like you know Google and YouTube and YC on how that stuff worked I was able to put together something that that uh actually made sense for everyone and allowed us to to work together and everyone makes great money so yeah I mean I think the the partnership and the the Rev share thing is is a really important thing to bring up like if you do find top talent you're not just you one you probably don't want to be paying out of pocket every month enough to keep these people on um you could be spending four5 $6,000 a month just to keep um or no no way more than that like 10 15 000 or more I mean a week $4,000 a week like you can be spending that much money just to keep these guys around um so for people who are just getting started that's not going to make sense but if you do have that irresistible offer of this is myself this is my connections this is what I'm going to do with my agency I have these leads lined up you going to be able to get x amount of rev share per per project that's going to be far more far more enticing to to secure this top talent as well um so and from your experience what's the uh what's the trick with getting these these deals oned J so I I think the the biggest thing thing in the beginning as a business owner since you're just getting off the ground is you have to you might have to give up more than you might want um if the business is doing amazingly right let's say you're doing many millions of dollars per year you can absolutely afford to to hire these top talent in most cases you can use that from a part of your margin um and things like that but in the case of just starting out um you kind of you kind of have to give more than you might be wanting to give as far as the revenue share in the hopes that you know you're building a bigger vision um in the business and so I'm I'm very much a team player I you know I played a lot of sports and um I'm very much not looking to build a business uh on my own and that's just my preference I know a lot of people um enjoy both kind of ends of it but but yeah that's uh I'd say the biggest thing and the the good thing about the Rev share agreement is that it's not it's obviously not Equity right and Equity is such a big step and there's a whole lot of paperwork involved you can write up a quick contract saying okay you get XYZ rev share per project and it's a lot more lightweight but you still get that heavy impact of well this guy serious about bringing me in so um I know you probably the equity side of things gets gets very messy so for people watching this I wouldn't recommend finding some random dude from from my community and immediately cutting a deal and giving them equity in your company uh but put them on a rue if they're top talent and you want to want to keep them around and you want to say hey look I'm serious about you being part of this Vision um you can do a very lightweight commitment to them and form of a contractual agreement of how you're going to be getting XYZ amount of a reer project and that's going to incentivize them a lot more too I mean then you can also get them into the the sales process at some point as well so a key part of the growth of of many of these agencies is not having to get on every single sales call yourself so if you can get the the CTO or the or the lead developer who's who's on R share but and therefore is also incentivized to be be selling these for as much as possible then you've got a nice alignment of of all the values in the company as well so um Talent is such a big thing and everyone who was at the the uh The Mastermind over the weekend that's the biggest thing it's just like look this the talent issue is so big and if anyone wants to work myself at Terrell I'm sure you can contact us down below but uh getting into the into the free community that I have is a great place to start if anyone is a uh is a developer looking to get in there and find other people there's going to be so many people from my recent video posting about hey look I'm looking for developers but likewise if you are hiring for a uh if you hiring for those positions as well you can go in there and look for people too so um do you want to jump into quickly your your YouTube and your plans to scale from here I think this is a very important thing for people looking at the success you've had so far and now deciding to kick it up again with the with the content well to be to be honest what happens when you bring on top talent is they end up pushing you um and so kind of our our big thing is um Java you know my head of engineering CTO he's focused on growing the engineering side of the business so hiring more engineers and things like that making sure that we can always deliver projects to a certain quality and then on my end I'm focused on scaling how how many clients we bring in on an ongoing basis and so our biggest uh initiative right now is growing our YouTube channel um YouTube channel of course focused on AI automation um primarily around voice Ai and and that sort of thing and I think you've just posted one video we can drop your Channel Down Below people to check out but uh what's the in for these guys to subscribe what can they expect from from your tutorials and and from your videos yeah so one of the things about our channel is we're only releasing like hourong plus Mega tutorials um so really walking through how to build these different systems um and Implement them in in in companies so we're starting with no code um keeping it very beginner friendly and and all of that and then uh maybe eventually I'll sprinkle in a a little bit of custom code in there too cool okay um well in terms of your your connection in the space I know just based off my recent experience over the weekend uh finding that group of people in the space that you are you become friends with is is so important how valuable has Community been and that's not just to be like well I know I have communities but just in general as a as an entrepreneur transitioning into a new type of business and a new uh new career path really it's so important you start to make those friends and build connections with with people who are like-minded and going SAR directions CU they they hold you accountable and they they like in your case jannis and Mark are all sharing you sharing leads back and forth so um how important has that been and what was your strategy for being prominent communities cuz you've really been one of the top guys and most prominent members in the community since we started so what's your strategy is there some secret for people who want to to rise to the top of these communities um how have you had to build that into your schedule or be very very conscious about it or are you just naturally a very very good networker and Communicator yeah no it was it was intentional I I think it's uh providing value in Goodwill and it eventually comes back I I call it business Karma and I really believe in that concept where you put in enough Goodwill and eventually it'll it'll uh come back in multiples right so it can take time and you can't predict how long it going to actually take um but yeah I jumped in there and I stuck around contributing in addition um I think the biggest benefit you get from these communities is when you're around like-minded people it just excites you it just excites you to hear about the new tech the new uh tools that are coming out and then how other people are utilizing those and having success so when you come into a community and you see on a regular basis that other people are actually making money and they just started like a few months ago I mean it's a it's a crazy feeling um and then you get to talk to them right you get to jump in talk to them they're real people and they actually um you know are making money so it's it's really cool to see and keeps you keeps you motivated so you can actually get through the hard parts of business I would say business is about putting the time in and sticking with it and so the more energy you have to do that um it's it it becomes that much easier awesome well Terrell I I really appreciate it I hope you guys have got something valued out of this um Terell has been I'm I'm going to really big up you here but teral has been an outstanding member of our community and has as he said continually provided value to others very selflessly and he is now reaping the reaping the rewards so I highly recommend for you all if you are new to this space the easiest way to succeed in this whe like highest percentage chance of succeeding is to go into communities like my own you can go to other ones but get in there and be as as valuable as possible be as prominent as possible show up the calls put your camera on network with people say hey I've just shot you a DM this these kind of activities along side I always talk about Spectators and and participants in the space and The Spectators are people who would watching the YouTube videos on Twitter scrolling Etc and the participants are the ones who are in the communities who are are giving value who are showing up to the calls who putting the camera on who are reaching out and dming people privately who are hopping on one-on-one calls when when no one else is like these are the these are the actions combined with steps like okay I'm going to be doing reaching out to clients this number times a day I'm going to do 50 c Outreach messages I'm going to post two bits of content each week it's these steps that once stacked up enough you're taking great strides towards being a a participant and successful participant of the market so I hope you guys can take a take a note out of Terrell's book and and realize that this this Market really is for the taking and for those of you who have more of a development background in Terrell you can see an example of hey look I'm going to specialize in building the best development team possible and then my services are going to be in high demand because there's so many other people in the space with personal Brands like myself and others that you can find um who are going to need people to uh help them deliver those projects so there's a there's there's a niche in this in this market for everyone um you just need to go and find it and here we have a great example of one so Terell I really appreciate it of course I appreciate you in the community um as do many others um so yeah we're looking forward to to seeing your future success and maybe we got to uh run this back in in a few months and see how you go awesome thank you so much l but we have actually one thing that I can do to help you out i' like to help these guys out on this as much as possible is it anything that myself or the community can help you out with I know that you had a couple things yeah I mean checking out our YouTube channel so it's called Terell and Lenny um you can go ahead and search that up on YouTube yep link will be in the description and then we also have our development agency

              "text": "hey guys Le Motley here and today we're going through how and where to hire your first developer as an AI agency owner now this is an extremely important and crucial Step In the Journey of any AI agency owner because if you're not able to get this right and and start to bring in external talent and expertise into your agency then you are never going to be able to free up your time to focus on more important things like actually growing the business so it's so important that you get this right and this is the the hurdle that many people never get over and stops people from going on to become successful with this business model long term so I wanted to make this video really breaking down everything that I have learned of the past 14 months and this is going to be probably one of the most important videos you watch this year if you're serious about this business model so let's get into it how and where to hire your first developer as an AI agency firstly my expertise in this topic comes from hiring and firing over 15 Developers for my own agency in the past 15 month which is a bit of a a weird Flex I know um but it shows the kind of turnover that you can see if you're very picky about the kind of talent that you let in and I've learned a lot from from go through 15 developers so key takeaways from this video for you is firstly going to be determining what developer you need for your agency to succeed this year secondly understanding what makes AAA developers different from regular developers um thirdly knowing the easiest way to find AAA Developers for your business and finally knowing how much to pay your developers so you don't get ripped off so very important things um we're going to get through all of these by the end of the video and here's um DJ C with the major key if you are new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam Motley I'm the creator of the triaa or AI automation agency model I'm the founder of my owner agency Morningside AI I've generated over 7even figures with my AI businesses over the past 15 months around the largest community of AAA owners in the world and I've hired all of my friends and live an awesome life all thanks to AI just a little bit of transparency about why I make these videos as well I know there's a lot of Skeptics out there now so um this is done on screen I have software products that I make for AAA owners and my community and if you become a successful AAA owner then you'll become a user of my software and eventually if I do things right um I can sell my software so without you winning and and succeeding with your own agency you will never use my software and I will never make the reach my end goal so we're kind of aligned on this so let's do it so the first thing we need to ask ourselves is why are we hiring what's the point of this in the first place um and this comes down to a few key things so finding and hiring the right developer is a crucial step in your journey as a AAA owner um failure to do this and and hire correctly and bring expertise into the business so that you can work on more important things is the killer of many aspiring AAA owners um they all try to get going they're doing it themselves and they never get find the right person or understand how to hire in the right way so they never advance past that where you can actually start to free things up and scale the business more um and the key thing here is that delivering high quality services is hard in the AI space I'm not going to Sugar cat it you need to have a capable team and capable expertise within your within your organization to deliver quality services CU there's so many people trying to start this right now but the number of high quality service providers who can give a great experience for their customers and create value is limited and that's limited to the people who have been able to successfully hire and delegate it off to capable teams as well and full transparency this is what completely changed my agency from us struggling initially it was bringing in the right Talent we had some really poor Talent initially and when we hired the right people it just completely opened things up for for us I can suddenly work on building my personal brand further so that we could get more leads and it really just set ourselves up for success as we have had over the past 12 months um on the right here are some examples of people winning within my program and if you're doing these $20,000 projects you have to have some kind of talent to deliver this stuff for you so that you can focus on more important things so if you want to get to these levels you need to get this first higher correct which brings me to the AAA model itself and the opportunity that this entire thing sits on and your role in my role as as AAA owners um and the first thing you need to understand is that there are a lot of developers rushing to this prom most AI land with all the money so that they can cash in on their on their share as we are trying to cash in on our share they're trying to cash in on their share um by running an upskilling to this to this Promised Land right but of these people that are rushing into the space as developers very few of them actually have the skills and knowledge to create value in the business with the skills and and use this technology to actually solve a real problem and create value which is where your job as an AI agency owner comes in and that's to identify opportunities for Value Creation with AI and deploy the team and the resources required to deliver it kind of like a general the Army um you survey the situation and then you deploy the resources and troops to solve that particular problem so you are the brain and they are the sword and this is where you create value as the AI automation agency owner so the first thing you need to understand when you are hiring developers is there's a there's a whole lot of different types of developers um it's not just one and so you need to understand where you're you're targeting your hiring efforts so that you can get what you need to to grow your business so there's frontend developers back end full stack devops there's a lot of different types as you can see in this diagram here um so we need to know know what we're looking for in particular so that we can actually grow our business um so I've got this little diagram here of these engineero spheres or the Spheres of engineering um different areas uh basically and we've got no code developers which have their own little thing going and they have had for the past while using things like zapia and make air table bubble Etc and then we have the more traditional AI ml developers who are traditional software Engineers that know how to use Python they've used things like pie torch or tensorflow and more recently they'd be using things like Lang chain to build llm based apps um with with python but what we're looking for really is this The Sweet Spot of AAA developers or AI automation agency developers um that combine both of these worlds um both the no code low Cod stuff and the traditional AIML expertise and that's where we get this middle area here so using platforms like voice flow which is our go-to chatbot Builder relevance AI which is great for building AI tools um and particularly connecting them to your gbts and and AI agents and then platforms like my own agentive which allows you to build chat GT like experiences for your clients and then some expertise in how to use language models prompt engineering and things like this so there's a sweet spot where these two words overlap and that's ideally what we want to be hiring not only are there different spheres of engineering though there's also levels to the game and there's levels of software Engineers going from entry level to senior so you've got a bunch of different factors when you're thinking of hiring which you need to understand before you go and start offering money for these positions so with these things in mind what are we actually looking for in our first hire so going back to the question of why are we hiring in the first place we're either hiring for a lack of technical expertise that that we are Miss missing and you need help to be able to plan and deliver the solutions CU without this expertise there's no there's no knowledge Gap within your agency between you and and the person that you're you're trying to help right you need some kind of expertise and you're you're making money by bridging that knowledge gap for them and delivering solutions that they wouldn't be able to do themselves so you may need some technical expertise in the business or it may just be a lack of time where you need to delegate project delivery to allow you to focus on growing the business um Easy by making content like I do on YouTube taking sales calls Etc so it's either one of these two problems and BAS on your situation whether it's a lack of technical expertise or just a lack of time um that determines whether you're trying to hire a senior developer or a junior developer so seniors are able to lead a team they're able to lead and manage Communications with your clients U they're able to architect and plan Solutions they're able to innovate and Lead product Improvement they're able to solve problems when they occur and finally they're also able to just be used to uh build and deliver the projects that you say you're going to do and Senior developers like this are contrasted against Junior developers which are basically just good for building and delivering projects or updating clients on what's Happening so they can't really lead Communications you wouldn't want them hopping on calls one-onone with the client and sorting them out there that's where the seni you guys come in and they have to be able to manage a team lead the project Etc and you can really hand things off to them so to illustrate when you did one or the other uh we've got some scenarios here so scenario one is a technical AAA founder say you've got some background in software engineering yourself uh that means you're comfortable and planning the solutions and leading the development so you you act as a senior developer but you hire one or two Juniors below you that you can kind of delegate to and rotate them as they're available um so you can delegate the actual delivery of it and manage the client communication yourself in this case you are serving as the CTO or the lead developer of the organization and this is quite common for the people who are Tech professionals who join my program my accelerator um and they come in and they say hey I want to I have the capabilities and the expertise to be able to lead the team myself and that allows you to run a little bit leaner because as you'll see in a little bit the pricing of developers of course juniors are going to be cheaper so if you do have the skills and you want to start an agency like this you can serve as the the lead developer of the CTO and just hire some Juniors underneath you and a good example of this is Mark a member from my community and I've actually got a podcast here with him on my channel if you haven't watched that already I'll leave that link down below but Mark is a is a software engineer by trade he came into the program and he's now done over $50,000 with his with his AR business but he's serving as the lead developer and he has a team of Juniors underneath them so that's one way of doing it um but secondly if you're a non-technical AAA founder and and some of you I know you're coming into this opportunity and you don't have a software background which is completely fine but it's a little bit different to how you would approach it as someone with that background in this case you'd have a non-technical Founder who understands the problems that the clients are facing but lacks the depth of knowledge required to actually plan how you're going to deliver that so in this case you would hire one senior AAA developer and then the owner can work alongside the dev and the client to make sure that the expectations are aligned and then they can delegate the delivery and communication to that senior developer because as we said these seniors can actually lead and manage the communication with the clients and also deliver the products themselves so in this case you hop on sales gos with the client you bring them in you connect them with your developer you make sure that everything's all good and you allow them to manage the delivery of those services and this gives you more time to bring more business into the business and a great example of this in action is my co-founder Josh at Morningside he came in completely clueless when it came to software and building AI Solutions it was just completely foreign to him but in the space of about 2 months of being on sales course with me he was able to learn okay these are the questions you asked this the kind of solutions that we offer okay okay and then I was able to fully hand off sales to him and then he's able to get on these hop on a course with our developers connect them up and do the process that I've just gone through here so it is possible and Josh to this stage still does not know how to code but he leads all of our sales and all of the operations at morning side so it is definitely possible and don't let your self-limiting belief stop you from achieving something like myself and Josh have your next question might be okay how much does this cost for a senior developer or a junior developer I know what I need now but how much am I how much am I on the line for here so um there's three tears of AI talent that we've seen and and we've hired at morning hi and let me just tell you right now that you don't want to be dealing with low low tier Talent there so just take that off the menu completely if they less than $30 they're likely low tier talent and not something that you want to get involved with I mean at your own risk you can you can ignore me if you want but this is from my experience that you don't want to be touching anything uh you get what you pay for um if you're good on the viting side and these tiers of talent translate nicely into these price brackets for senior and Junior developers so the senior developers they're likely going to be $70 to $100 per hour ideally they've got some kind of traditional development background because they are going to be leading the team and you are trying to bring in if you're going to be buying and bringing in expertise you don't just want to bring in a sliver of how he can build chat bots on voice flow you kind of want to get the whole picture because um You probably don't as the agency owner have much uh expertise you want them to complement you cover off the areas that you're not familiar with um and understand what production applications look like not just gimmicky little chat Bots and stuff like you probably can do uh yourself there's a big difference between tinkering around them with a prototype and a production grade solution so these guys that you bring in as a senior need to cover off their the for you within the business so a traditional developer turned AI solution specialist where they understand voice flow agentive all these different platforms relevance make Etc ideally you can get that hybrid you're not always going to be able to find it but the hybrid senior developer who could do both sides of that is really what you're looking for and ideally 5 years of experience in a development role and then you have the Juniors and we split these up into two categories really uh guys who can do the only AAA related services so whether that's voice flow relevant Etc only the low code no Cod stuff they're only worth about3 $40 an hour from from our testing uh but if they have the traditional background and they're able to combine it with the AAA solutions that we typically sell and they understand everything that I talk about here on the channel then they're worth more like $50 to $70 per hour and the reason for this is that if a developer can also leverage these no code low code tools at the right time you can deliver services with far less time invested so for example if you wanted to build a web chat widget chat bot and put it on a customer's website um and you tried to do that all custom it would take a ton of time and cost you a lot more than if you had a guy who knew how to use uh these AAA platforms that we talk about so often here on the channel and was able to just okay I can put this on voice FL I can build this out in a couple of hours you're actually getting more value out of them because they're able to deliver the same thing for less and less time so you paying $50 to $70 per hour if they're able to at the right time use low code and no code tools combined with their traditional background you're getting more bang for your buck H them being more expensive and these guys here the Juniors who have traditional and AAA experience and knowledge they're essentially a a baby version of the senior right they're just missing the managerial capabilities um and the the ability to actually plan these Solutions so these guys are highly valuable and can be trained up as you'll see just here you can turn your Junior developers into senior over time um so they have the talent that you're looking to develop and this requires zooming out a lot more on your agency and not seeing them as a static part of your business but seeing Talent as a major part of how you're going to grow over time um and picking the right things and planting seeds and and watching them grow over time is really important so when it comes to your senior developers you need the strong techn skills of course the 5 years of experience deep understanding of traditional code um and also ideally some of the newer stuff that we talk about on this channel uh interpersonal skills being able to talk to your clients being able to deal with the team um being able to communicate with you about what the hell is going on in the business which is so key um and the ability to Mentor on Coach your Juniors which is really important and for juniors you just want to pick rock stars that are just starting off they natural aptitude towards the the stuff that you're building potential and the ability to learn as well so Juniors they're not by definition they're not garbage or or not useful they are just people who are earlier in the journey and you can with the right training and with the right senior developer can really bring them up into a super high valuable part of the organization and just quickly I want to introduce a few uh considerations when you are hiring and that's the type of agency that you're running will determine the type of developer that you need to hire um so whether you're doing a niche or general agency which i' I've got a video coming on so if you haven't already subscribed to the channel and don't understand the difference between niched and general agencies make sure you subscribe down below um because there's a big difference in picking that picking the right type is so key to your success in the space so uh basically are you building from scratch every time or are you using templated Solutions so if you're General agency you're likely going to be doing custom every time and if you're a a niche agency you're likely going to be replacing or or copy and pasting across multiple clients a considerable amount of the build and that determines the level or skill level of developers that you need as you'll see in a second reusability is a key concept that you need to understand and secondly are you just selling low code or no code Solutions or are you also throwing in some custom coded aspect to it as well so do they need that traditional background these are things you need to keep in mind useability as I said um planning a builing from scratch is difficult and prone to more errors the fact that you can copy and paste across clients if you're running an Eed agency allows you to minimize the amount of brain power required to think like actually planning and architecting a solution is difficult to do every single time something new comes in the door smart developers can handle these errors that's why you hire the senior because they can solve um but if they're just modifying from a template and you're a n agency um then lower tier Developers will do and will suffice in most cases because they're not having to rethink or reinvent the wheel every time they do a new project therefore you don't need as expensive or as intelligent or or skilled developers now the key question you know what kind of developer you need you know what level you're looking for you know what's missing in your business um where the hell do you find them which is a question that I get a lot and I just want to remind you quickly of these engineero spheres where we've got no code developers these traditional guys on the right and then the triaa developers which are kind of this hybrid in between where they've been watching my content introduced to the the concept of this AI order agency model as a whole and they understand okay chat Bots and automations okay tools Etc this is the kind of stuff that we're delivering on and these are the tools that we and platforms that we use to deliver them so you need to find people who fall into this AAA developer category so that you don't have to bring them up to speed on all of this information but this is the model that I'm running these are the tools that we use these are the kind of things we sell you need to find them ideally where they already understand that and they've already built with the tools that we need to build with and the best place to find these AAA developers is in my free school Community not a just Shameless plug here but we do have nearly 15,000 people who have watched my videos understand this and a huge portion of the community members in here are developers and do have a development background I've heard of people hiring ex Postman head of engineering and now they have an incredible partner within their agency there is incredible talent that floats through and and watches my videos and floats through my community looking for people and looking for opportunities there's so many people coming out at Big Tech at the moment who are looking to get into this AI space and the AI agency model is such a a good thing for people to get into because if you're a developer you can come in and give give value and maybe partner on the agency if you're a sales guy you're a you're you're an entrepreneur you can come in and lead the agency and and identify problems to solve with AI it's it's so exciting for so many people which is why we have so many people coming through and link to join in the description but you want to come in here and make a post and say I am this here's my background I am hiring for this this is what I'm looking for either hey I'm looking for a partner or I'm just looking for an hourly basis at the moment I have some clients you do need to sell yourself and and pit yourself within the community so we have a bunch of hiring going on in the Community ready you can see every one of these posts are getting 5 to 10 different responses on it um so I urge you guys if you're looking to hire join the free community it's down below first link in the description make a post pit yourself say this is what my agency is this is what we're doing uh and be really and and you do need to sell yourself in order to attract the best talent so get in there drop a post and also if you're a developer watching this get in there and start replying um engage in the community and there's so much value to be created by connecting the right people together and that's what I want for most of you is that if you can't get this right if you can't find someone to hire um you can't pair up a a sales guy an Ops guy and a a developer then you're likely never going to succeed long term with this business cuz it's so crucial something that I've found and I've seen time and time again with people in my free and PID communities so once you've got into my school and posted hey I'm looking for a junior developer who knows this this this familiar with these tools we looking to sell these Etc um then you need to know how to sign them what deal to actually close these guys on close these guys on but what contract are you bringing them into your business on how are you going to be interacting with them what's the compensation structure um which is a really big question I get as well so uh the contract agression that I recommend and that we've used at morning side is is starting off with a fixed contract then we don't do it anymore but when we very first started our agency we will doing it on a fixed contract where we'd go to have conversations with a bunch of developers and and AI specialists at the time who really weren't much specialists at all but would go to them and say hey we have a client here who needs XYZ Services can you give us a proposal on how much time this would take and how much it would cost you would get proposals back from our different developers mark it up to or 3x go to our client and say hey this is the price of the build very easy way get started you're not necessarily putting cash up front because the client's then going to pay that invoice or pay half the invoice and you can pass to the developer so as long as you got a margin there you can basically never lose money as long as a project goes through without issue and then after that if they've shown that they're good and they know what they're doing you can move them onto an hourly contract and give them a starting wage so hey look we agree on $3 $40 per hour um we're going to do a 30-day free trial so you can basically cut them off at any point um I mean you can put in the contract that you can end it at any point um so this trial period will allow you to test them further and what you want to do is put time doctor um it's a it's a Time tracking thing that monitors the screen and then you can see how many hours they're logging and pay them based on those hours now if all things go well and after that 30-day contract um everything checks out and they've delivered good services for your on behalf of your agency um then you can start looking at a full-time contract um and you can lock in a salary so you're getting $3 $4,000 a month um and expected hours associated with that contract um full-time contracts are of course a big jump and spending $44,000 a month every single month to have someone on might seem daunting um but it is really key um in a number of ways one them working full-time for you is going to make sure that all of their focus is on your projects and you can put in the contract you are not allowed to work on other things and you will find if you're working on upw work or or even people within my community if they're juggling multiple projects at once they're going to be giving you a fraction of their energy and and time that it is required to really deliver what you need to deliver and meet that standard that your clients are expecting so full-time contract you get their soulle focus and also if you do it right you can make your agency far more profitable by using salaried employees rather than all based on so full-time contract is ideally where you want to get to once you have a consistent flow of leads as well that are going to make sure that you will always have the money to pay them um that's what we run out at morning side for basically all of our developers unless we're triling them um and finally you can offer a partnership this is something that might be a bit more lucrative if you are making those School post and and putting yourself out there and saying hey look I have a bunch of leads or I have connections to xby Industry I'm looking for a technical partner to do this you may need to go to the partnership route and offer some kind of Revenue share on all of the projects you do so okay you're going to get 30% of all the revenue for the project and this will attract far bit Talent um because they're going to be more incentivized they're actually tied to the earnings rather than just being paid paid a wage or paid a salary right so that's contract progression and that's about it so key takeaways for this video as I promised in the intro you have determined what developer you need for your agency to succeed it's a AAA developer whether it's a junior or senior depending on your situation you now understand what makes AAA developers different and that is the platforms that we use to deliver our specific Solutions and that kind of cross over between the two worlds of no code and traditional AI development um thirdly you know how much to pay your developers and those different price ranges whether you need junior or senior Etc and finally you know the easiest way to find a AAA developer for your agency because you just need that one person to get things off the ground really guys it's so important to get that first hire and it's it's one of the biggest steps for you in succeeding with this long term so go on my school Community if you're not already make a post Network show up to my calls that's another great way to do it I host a live Q&A every week on Friday within my free community so you can hop on there have a chat with me and if there's an opportunity for partnership you can put your your email or your contact details in the chat and so many people have been connected by that way cuz there's 100 people watching chances are there's someone who can help you or is interested in partnering with you so a great way to find good talent is to hop on those calls and participate in the discussion so

              "text": "hey guys Liam Motley here and today I want to make a quick video breaking down the three most important questions that you need to ask before taking on any AI projects to your agency um now these questions at myself and my team at Morningside have had to learn by trial and error and this is what we've come to and and continue to use to this day after coming up with it around a year ago this time last year um and it continues to be the set of questions that we ask during our sales process and also as soon as we get into the actual building of the project um that's the the information that we need to collect very important to understand this if you're looking to build an AI agency and be successful in this space so let's get into it so three key questions starting off these are things we'll typically ask during our sales process initially and this is really how myself and my team figure out what a project is about and what the goal is what who the end users are and and these three questions are really what allow us to connect all these pieces together so the first thing up here is data now I know data isn't a question but what data is this system or is this build going to be using or integrating because we're using llms and and and chat gbt apis there's some kind of data that's going to be flowing through and Hing that API at some point and we're going to be manipulating it we're going to be doing something with it it might be a custom knowledge chatbot it might be an automation we be passing some kind of data through it we need to know what data they're going to be using in the system or what we're going to be manipulating with our AI tasks and with our functions so first things first is data what data are you using or what data is going to be built into the system um next we have inputs so what are the expected inputs of the system um whether that's an email classification system where it's going to have emails from XYZ inbox that are going to be moving through it or typically in the form of chatbots and agents that you build who who's the end user of this how are they actually going to be sending questions to it what are they expecting to get out of it this is really important to to understand how this data is going to be used um and then finally um you may have guessed it we have uh outputs so with this we get a nice little triangulation which allows us to understand what this project is and by triangulating these different parts um we understand what they're looking to build because if you know what data they're getting they know what questions are being asked and you know what they're trying to Output then you have a full picture of okay this is what the system is doing I'm using AI or language models to convert this data given this prompt into this output now this may look like in the form of okay I'm going to be using C is V I'm going to be using PDFs okay well what are in those PDFs is it diagrams is it going to be just all text what is the content of the PDF and how big are they all these kind of questions that you need to ask about the data that's going into the system and then for the inputs we'll just ask for a list give us a list of 5 to 10 expected inputs that the user or end user would end up giving to the system okay great we've got a list of those okay now can we also get a list of outputs and you may be starting to connect the dots here because in my recent video on exploration milestones and cosine similarity which I'll link up here somewhere um very important you watch that and we weren't able to scale past $10,000 per month in my agency until we implemented those systems and it's it's it's a new thing that we've had to invent for these AI agencies because of the nature of the technology we're working with so um if we get a list of inputs and a list of outputs and then we know the data that we need to put in we can then run some kind of test sorry there's another triangle but this is supposed to be the system that we put into it um it's flowing the wrong way but you get the idea we can put the inputs into this and test the outputs so we use these questions at various stages of our client life cycle so in the discovery call we'll ask these questions what data as the system going to be using or manipulating what are the expected inputs what are some of the expected outputs that you want from that data given these inputs we get the full picture um but then we can go into our exploration phase which I've covered in in the earlier video that I mentioned and the exploration phase is a $800,000 $2,000 Milestone and we've continued to increase the price over time and you guys can too uh but it's a a quick Milestone that allows us to say okay give us a sample of the data give us some sample inputs give us some sample outputs let us mock up a quick system a prototype of the system cuz with LM apps it's usually fairly easy to get a prototype up or at least a proof of concept that shows okay yes we can achieve this or we can get to close enough to the end result that we can be confident in in the outputs or or in the final result being there if we put in a bit of extra work so we click the data we click the inputs and outputs we run a little exploration Milestone and then we can actually do some cosine similarity testing to determine if we're able to make this thing work so yes we've had on the Discovery call we've learned about it is this something like initially is this a project that we're interested in taking on is this data too tricky is it CSV or is it PDF with images in it is this data too tricky for the current technology so if it's not then we say okay sorry we're not interested in that project but if they get past step one and they get they become a client okay now we have this discovery Milestone which is step two okay we can do this sort of test does this does these inputs and the data are we able to get a proof of concept or or prototype up okay yes we've moved through that okay now we're into stage three which is the actual build and we need to go through and and Flash this thing out and really get down to this desired set of outputs and we build these into the contract as I mentioned in that video so very important that you go and watch that it will have be linked up there or down in the description as well but this concept of these three questions that we asked to get a a holistic idea of the project that we're taking on is not just limited to to this stuff here it's actually part of a broader broader issue and and thny part of of running these AI agencies and building AI solutions to businesses and that is expectation management and this is something that continually will RAR its head in your journey and continue to C issues if you are not absolutely brutal on your attempts to squash it and shut it down and get yourself and your client on the exact same uh eye level of of what this project and what the project will look like in its final form so when it comes to expectation management those three questions are so key because initially you're going to be able to say yes or no we can do the project great on the Discovery call sales cor whatever you want to call it that gets you into the exploration phase when you can say okay now we're going to try to do a prototype test this see if we can get the kind of outputs we want using coens it check that they're similar enough then we can move into the final project but before you go any further you need to really be careful about setting these expectations correctly which is using the cosine similarity test so that's one of the techniques we use cosine so cosine similarity test during their exploration phase and that's going to let them know hey these are the kind of outputs we can get from this exploration phase we did you show them very very clearly and we do this at morning site every time do the exploration get the proof of concept get the Prototype generate a set of outputs hop on and call the client and say are you happy with these outputs everything is based on language everything is subjective and they all have opinions and feelings and again you can't build a business based on the the worms and feelings of your clients you need to have something more solid than that or you're going to be dead in the water So Co similarity test at the end of that exploration showing that yes we've met the input and output requirements to to be similar um but also showing to the client and getting feedback and saying hey what do you think of this this is going to be what it looks like in the final version can you please confirm that this is what you're happy with and that's what we're going to use based on the uh the final contract is going to be the results like this but more recently and something I really want to introduce to you guys now as as myself and the team at morning side have just started to experiment with it but also mockups where the client will see the end result and some kind of graphical mockup of of what the display will be like because yes it's one thing to get the outputs but often times you'll send them back the outputs and in something that doesn't look too flashy it's it's like a bit rough around the edges because it's a prototype and then they look at it and they go oh well that's that's not what I wanted at all because you hadn't managed the expectations of what it was going to look like we're experimenting right now with sending over graphical mockups and doing a little design and sending that over to them and saying hey look this is what it's going to look like this is how the answers are going to be displayed within the window this is what the overall UI of it on your website is going to look like Etc um so mockups and giving some kind of flash forward to the end product not just in terms of the out puts but also in in terms of the Optics and and the visuals of what it's going to look like is further going to help your expectation management so that you don't get to the end and the clients go e I'm not happy with this so that's all I want to say in this video expectation management the three questions what data is the system going to use what are the expected inputs and what are the expected outputs with those three you can eyeball a project very very clearly that's that's all I use to to survey or analyze a project before you take it on but then when you get further down the sales life cycle towards an the exploration phase Co and similarity testing and even giving mockups just to really manage your expectations show the client that this is what you're going to get because unfortunately chat gbt open AI they have such amazing AI experiences that they set the bar way up here and us as AI agency owners while we love chat gbt it is our worst enemy at times because it's such a good experience for people and they a lot of these early adopters that you have coming to your agency they use chat pretty heavily and they go wow this is really cool I want something like this for my business and then for you as an agency owner with one developer trying to replicate chat BT level polish is very difficult to do so this is your Saving Grace so that's all for the video guys if you've enjoyed hit down below leave a like uh subscribe

              "text": "trying to keep up with the AI news is stopping you from making any money in the AI space and in this video I'll be sharing my experience with the AI news black hole and explaining why you need to give it up right now if you want to have any success or any future in the AI space if you are new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I'm the creator of the AI automation agency model or AAA I've also been running and building AI businesses for the past 16 months and in that time I've been able to generate over a million dollars in Revenue across my businesses so on this channel I try to share my learnings and experience so that you guys can do the same and and with me take advantage of this AI Opportunity by building and scaling your AI businesses this video is going to be a little bit different but nevertheless it's something that you need to hear if you're looking to start businesses in the AI space so how did I get to this conclusion that AI news was bad for AI entrepreneurs um well let me take you back to 2023 around this time of year in May um and I'd started my agency we're seeing some success we're starting to sell at no Code and low code Solutions as well as our custom coded Solutions um and as soon as I started to getting into these tools I started going oh well if if I found this tool then what if there's another tool that's even better and what if what if I'm I'm not using the most optimal tool for the job and I think we're using bot press at the time when we first started to build these chat Bots um and sooner or later we moved over to voice flow and I was like oh well if if one tool was good and then another one's better maybe I should set up a whole system so that I can keep tabs on everything that's happening in the space and I can share it on YouTube videos and I can build it into my agency and I can just be like the smartest guy when it comes to tools and I'll know everything that's going on I'll be tapped into everything in the space that's what I thought and at the time I saw a map wolf video Matt wolf you may know he does AI new stuff and he showed his system for tracking all of the the stuff that's coming in the the articles that are being released the YouTube videos and he tracked it on on this big trailer looking system and I was like wow if he's doing that then I need to do something similar so that I can be tapped in and and have all of the the tools coming straight into my brain um long story short that ended up just massively distracting me and causing a huge amount of cognitive load and just overloading my brain with a bunch of crap I didn't need to have and I started to notice I I I kept persisting cuz I was like no this is good I I can make YouTube videos on it I can plug these things into the solutions we selling for my clients um and no this this is good this is something I should be doing and then eventually I looked back on the past 3 or 4 months of me using the system and tracking it all and and I went like if I actually use this is this brought any value to my life or my business and I looked through it and I had not used any of the tools that I I tracked or looked into um in any of the client builds that i' done it was always too experimental it was too cutting Edge it was the latest news on what Google was doing this it it just wasn't applicable to the stuff that we were selling and at the end of the day I'd never actually implemented anything that I'd watched or or learned about it was all just load and and and mess and clutter in my head that had really distracted me from the the the primary functions of the businesses for me which is to attract new clients through YouTube videos like these and in reality when I was spending time watching people with these tools or watching people with these AI news updates I was spending so much time that could have been put into actually building my business and or making my own videos I instead of spending 20 minutes or an hour watching YouTube I could have filmed two or three YouTube videos in that space and just the the levels of difference of impact on on those two tasks and those two activities is just completely different and it was at that point that I realized I'd been tricked I've been scammed not by Matt wolf but I've been scammed by the by my own brain to to convince myself into thinking that I needed to be tapped in I needed to be soaking it all up or I'd missed something important um and I realized when you're building AI solution for your clients when you start an AI agency or AI automation agency the technology that you use in your builds needs to be solid needs to be reliable and anything by Nature that's coming out on these news channels that's coming out um on these new articles that are that are being released the latest updates in the space that's experimental and and Cutting Edge technology and if you're trying to sell these Solutions they're not going to be anywhere near reliable enough maybe in a year or two that stuff will be applicable to your clients but we need to stick to what we know we need to stick to voice flow Bots we need to stick to open Ai apis and boring regular boring regular a llm apis and and non fancy stuff because it's not going to be able to deliver the high quality service that you need and the consistency and reliability if you're using some startups product so my first point here is that you do not need to watch all this AI news crap because we have all of the tools that we need to build and make money we don't need to be looking for new stuff right now if it's new it's experimental and it's not going to be able to be applicable to the clients that we serve we need reliability we need consistency we need predictability and the way we get that is by using tried and tested systems and platforms voice flow for structured chat Bots we you need to control the flow of the conversation assistance API and there I say it my own stive is built on top of the assistance API so that you can build conversational chat GPT like experiences for your clients on top of open AI assistance API so the structured chat Bots and conversational open-ended chat GPT like chat Bots and experiences and things like make.com and Zapf automations and relevance AI for for AI tools you don't need to go much outside of that and just stick to the things that we know work rather than trying to keep tabs and mental notes on on all the latest and greatest stuff that's coming out so on one hand we have the more practical implication of does this technology that I'm keeping tabs on actually allow me to make money or actually allow me to deliver Services of value to my clients that they're happy with and willing to pay for so step one but then there's also the other side of it entirely which is you are trying to build a business and you only have a limited number of hours in every day and if you're investing some of those hours in non Revenue generating activities and things that aren't directly directly tied to to Bringing more money in the door then you are wasting your time you are mentally masturbating you're procrastinating on what work needs to be done and I'll be fully transparent I was I think to some degree I was I was procrastinating as well I was thinking somehow I can sit here and watch the screen and it'll help me to make money and be a better AI entrepreneur and in reality I didn't see any flow through of that to value my business we didn't start growing exponentially all of a sudden when I was watching videos and keeping tabs on the news that's just not it and and from the people that I know in my accelerator and in the community and from my own personal experiences the guys and girls who were making money in the space are not the ones sitting there watching YouTube videos or tracking all the news and being active on Twitter it is just so far from the stuff you need to be doing and it this comes back to something that I talk about a lot on the channel which is the difference between AI Spectators and AI participants and I I hate to say it but you may be a a spectator you may be I mean if you're watching my video and you haven't started an agency and you haven't taken action and and tried to go out there and and messaged every person in your in your contact list and every person on your Instagram and asked them and said hey do you know anyone who's interested in in these things I can build for you if you haven't started taking those steps and and really moving yourself towards being a participant and actually taking this AI opportunity for for what it's what it's worth then you're you're a spectator and it's I think it should feel dirty it it is it feels like a dirty word where you're just spectating you think you're and you're mentally in the space you're clocked in you're you're sitting there thinking that watching these videos is going to somehow translate to success in the AI space and it's not I'm sorry to break it to you but it's not going to be handed to you it's not going to be handed to you through YouTube video as much as as I try to do this for you and and try to create videos that hand you the information you need to succeed in the space and start your agencies end of the day you're the only one moving the moving the mouse and clicking the keys you need to go and actually do it you need to put those things into practice you need to do the activities that are actually going to drive r revenue for your business when we think about Spectators and participants if you are trying to be a participant you need to do everything you can that's the the antithesis or the opposite of what these Spectators are doing they just scrolling on Twitter they're they're talking crap they are watching YouTube videos you need to be doing the absolute opposite cuz your job is to put as much distance between you and them as possible and every time you make an action it's it's sort of adding up to this tally of am I distancing myself from them and if you're serious about succeeding in the space it is doing the opposite of what all these people and I I think it's a it's a clear example of the number of Spectators in the space and and not not to not to bash Matt wolf he does a great service to the community and putting the AI news out there for people who need to be tapped in for PE keyword people who need to be tapped in of course Matt wolf has a system for tracking all the news he's an AI news guy I'm not an AI news guy I don't need to know all this stuff I'm ai ai agency owner and and I teach people how to build these businesses like it's I don't need to know all that stuff and and neither do you so I want to plant this cont in your brain of every time you're doing something and you you think you're working on your business you need to be clear about is this actually putting any distance between myself and and The Spectators cuz that's the only thing you should be concerned about right now is how far can I get from these guys who refuse to take action and just sort of pedal in the space to people who are actually building businesses and learning skills it's going to take them further cuz there's a big gap between us right now and myself and and the other people who are actually active participants are running away with the game right now and I'd love for you to join us but it's not going to happen if you continue to prioritize the wrong thing okay so recapping my points here first is that the technology you're going to find in these News videos is not even applicable to what you're actually building with your clients and point two is that watching these videos and keeping up on the news is a misallocation of your resources when you need to be putting it into Revenue producing activities within the business so that you can dis yourself from The Spectators um into the participants group and finally for point three I want to broaden this outside of AI news to all news in general cognitive load refers to the amount of information that our working memory can process at any given time if you are continuing to load your brain with unnecessary and and unhelpful information you're just going to overload your brain and and block it from soaking in and processing the information that you really need to be baking into your long-term memory which is how can AI help businesses okay what techniques should I be using to scale this or or start these kind of videos or you just do not have enough brain in this finite Cranium up here and then the brain that you have in your head does not have enough juice to also be juggling oh what's happening in the news oh something's happening in France oh cool oh wow Australia's had it's just you're clogging up the information highways in your brain with stuff that it's just never going to make you a dime and I know you might think oh but I need to be up to date on on the current events in the world like what if something something happens trust me your job and my job right now is just to make as much money as possible build ourselves into people who are capable of generating and attracting tons of wealth by the skills we have and the connections that we've built and then maybe when you've got 5 or 10 million stacked up and you've got a lot of wealth to preserve then maybe you start thinking about okay the economic situation of the world but right now right in front of our face we have an opportunity and we need to go all in on learning skills building businesses and focusing on activities that are actually going to bring money in the door and before I wrap things up I know I need to answer the question of like okay but but what about open AI updates like should should we not be watching them yes yes that is the one thing that as you saw my recent video that is the one thing that I will actually look into because open AI is leading the space and I basically only use open aai products and and the solutions that I sell to my clients and my S is built on the open AI ecosystem as well so by narrowing down instead of being this agency that just does all of it I just work with open AI so I only need to listen to open ai's news and that's 2 or three times a year so by simplifying my business down to the leading AI company I can just focus on what Sam mman and the team say over there and every few months I just sit my butt in a chair and and watch their release it's great I just get these little doses of the important stuff that I need and that allows me to to run my business as as efficiently as possible and finally I couldn't make this video without some kind of takeaway of what you should be focusing on instead of AI news and if you strip this chunk of your day and your week out what do you now fill that with and it goes back to what I said earlier in the video which is instead of spending an hour doing this rubbish you could make one YouTube video in that time or you could make two LinkedIn posts or you could start posting on Twitter if you can replace this this news and and keeping up activities with things like marketing your services or building a personal brand I am living proof that this stuff is worth it and that there is a massive opportunity for building personal brands in the AI space and specializing in something I specialize in in creating AI agencies and teaching people how to do it you can specialize in how real estate agents can do XYZ with AI or or how ruers can there's so many little niches In Pockets that are just waiting to be filled or I'm the the Liam otley in in Latin America I'm the Liam mle in Brazil so many people come and say that's exactly what I'm doing I'm just copying your strategy but I'm doing it in my country great I I want you guys to win at the end of the day you know that I only win if you guys win I only win with my my software and and my products if I'm able to get you guys to win and become successful agency owners you have no use for what I do with the software that I'm trying to build for for AI agency owners if you're not signing clients and being successful so I'm here for you to help you win and please listen to what I've said in this video because it's made a meaningful difference in my business a meaningful difference in my mental health and overall well-being so please cut the stuff out of your life and you'll be amazed by the results if you're interested in seeing what a week of my life here in Dubai as an AI agency owner looks like you can check out my recent vlog here if you have enjoyed please hit down below and leave a like um leave a comment down below i' love to hear your thoughts on this or your experiences I'm sure many of you have have been down the same road as me so I'd love to hear that down below and of course subscribe to the channel if you haven't already for more videos like this teaching how to build businesses and succeed in the AI space so that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see

              "text": "hey guys Le Motley here and today I've got a video breaking down the GPT 40 release uh the reason for the spring update from open AI there's some good things and there's some bad things for the AI agency space I wanted to jump on here and give my thoughts now that I've had a few days to Stew it and really think about what the implications are for us so GPT 40 the good and the bad for AI agencies of course what's new if you've been living under a rock we've had the open AI spring update recently and they released a bunch of things but mainly uh the new flagship model GPT 40 um o meaning Omni and this is a step towards much more natural human and computer interaction according to open aai on their blog post so that's taking in inputs of text audio image and video and it's able to output and text audio and image so massive new capabilities that we've kind of been cobbling together using different services and we've had whisper and we've had these other services that allow us to get this kind of functionality anyway but they've just pulled it all into one and allowed the model to understand not only text input but also audio and video and stream it all into one input as well so very exciting stuff um I was hoping for GPD 4.5 or gpg 5 um but as we'll see later in this video there's some ramifications of what this incremental Improvement might mean for this bace um but I'll save that for a little later so there's also other stuff of the new chat GPT desktop app which is cool I've just been able to get it downloaded I think I need to update with Mac as many of you guys will as well I think it's only available for Mac uh for the time being um and GPT 40 is now available to free users um not just plus subscribers and therefore the GPT store is open to over a 100 million users so if you guys are interested in uh jumping on gpts I know I've made a video before that I think a lot of you found my Channel Through the GPT store is now available to 100 million users or more um which is great great news for you if you're hoping to be a GPT developer um we have yet to see anything about the monetization of gpts so I'd be curious to see what they have in store for that cuz that's kind of they attracted us all they honey potted us into this gpts uh and building gpts on the store thinking it's going to be an app store moment saying yeah monetization this monetization that um and we haven't seen seen anything of at least I have haven't seen anything about about the gbt store monetization so other stuff I don't think it's that relevant for us as as AI agency owners okay I want to start off with the good points first then we'll get on to the bad a little later um here's Sam Alman counting up all the all the money he's making from these recent updates um firstly new modalities it is a good advancement we are getting a ton of new solution opportunities opening up for us as we're able to take in different types of inputs from our end users and then give them different types of outputs back and really there's there's it's not a massive Leap Forward cuz we've been able to do this one of the examples on screen that openai has provided shows them asking a question and then providing an audio file as part of the input and then it's able to answer questions and reason off the back of that as well but prior to that it's not we were able to do that with transcription anyway we just transcribe it and then put it into the give it to the model to to reason over so not a massive leap we've been able to do a lot of these things but really what it is is just a simplification of our workflow and of the systems we need to build for our clients um less fiddling around with multiple different apis which is easier to get the results that we want for our clients and I think this is great for many of you who are not so technically inclined and I know a lot of you have been brought into this opportunity and still struggle with some of the technical parts of it but it's a clear Trend that we're seeing towards this simplification but there's still a level of complexity of how can this actually be implemented into the business so you're getting easier to do um but you still you're getting more power essentially in your hands that you can provide to your clients as well and because we're going to be using fewer apis this is probably going to decrease our cost as well because we're not having to use transcription and then generate an answer and then use text to speech if we're using these kind of systems which we'll get on to next which I think is pretty exciting The Voice AI systems and providers I think are going to win big here um because once audio inputs and outputs become available via the GPT 40 API the response times can be reduced by up to 60% um based off the numbers that open AI is provided which is between 200 and 300 milliseconds for responses at least that's what we saw of the chat GPT in the demo and as you can see here on platforms like vapy um even on the fastest and lowest intelligence model uh we've got a 650 millisecond response time and this is purely because they're having to stack up so many models that when your voice comes in over the phone they have to transcribe that then they have to generate an answer and text and then they need to turn that text into speech and then they need to send it off to you as well so this 650 millisecond latency which was fine it was fast enough we're now going to get a potentially 60% reduction of that as well so I think soon as these guys are able to access vapy and and Bland Etc are able to access GPT 40 via API and send and receive audio inputs and outputs um we could see a a continued boom of the voice AI space which is something I've been talking about a lot on the channel here if you guys are just starting with your AI agency you know looking for a good place to start or specialize in then voice AI is a great place to look into next we have a quick win for us as AI agency owners which is GPT 40 apis being twice as fast and 50% cheaper than GPT 4 Turbo it's always great on these big updates from open AI cuz we can kind of expect these reductions um and it's good to see that they're continuing to do this over time so we can expect it in future and an interesting thing to point out is that we're getting much closer to this GPT 3.5 Turbo cost which is is basically free this thing is so cheap it's it barely cost you a dime to do anything um but here we can see that we've got input of $5 and 50 for gbt 3.5 turbo so it's just a 10x price difference considering the the massive increase in intelligence and and modalities that we're going to get from GPT 40 you can't not be happy with that outcome next we have another quick win for us as AI agency owners which might have slipped under the radar for you a little bit better language support for GPT 40 that can handle over 50 different languages now covering 97% of the spoken world and it's also going to decrease a token usage as you can see here the new token compression method is actually reducing the amount of tokens for some of these languages as you can see now this may not seem like a major but this is a question I get all the time my accelerator and on my free community q&as which is should I be selling local or should I be trying to sell in the US or should I be trying to sell in Europe it's mainly people interested in selling in the US um and my answer is always no ideally Go Local um if you're if you're from South America and you're trying to go over to the United States and start selling there you're at a natural disadvantage just by purely being outside of the country you might sound a little different over the phone um you might have a name that doesn't necessarily ring like you're you could be someone's neighbor um and there's nothing wrong with that but it's just the the cold heart facts of it's going to be harder for you you're playing at some kind of disadvantage or debuff versus someone who is is John Smith who lives next door you know if you're in for example the Spanish speaking world I'm sure you've already had Fairly good responses and and good translation capabilities from GPT uh but it's really the smaller areas and these smaller languages that up until now haven't really had the support now you can be the first person into those markets so if you live somewhere that you thought oh no one's ever going to be able use this in my language or I shouldn't bother selling local now is your chance to be the first guy or the first girl in that market to go and start selling these Solutions and you might say that oh but they don't they're not interested in AI don't try to sell it as AI then just sell it as a meaningful difference in their business and now getting into the bad and we may have the rise of e girlfriends sooner or later um but that's not what I want to go into here um it's actually the long road to integration that's the first thing that I'm kind of concerned about here um and and by that what I mean is these new modalities and text and audio and video and image and all this stuff is cool but it's it it doesn't mean anything to us as AI agency owners until we're able to get that to our in customer with all these platforms that we use like make.com and voiceflow um and sending things to WhatsApp and the different solutions we build they are lagging far behind the technology that open AI is providing it really is an issue of trying to get the stuff in the hands and making it useful for our end users um but until these platforms catch up and and allow support for the customers concerned voice notes and they can send photos and and say voice flow allows you to send photos through your web chat widget which I'm not sure why and more so for things like WhatsApp deployments for your your AI agents um being able to send voice notes to the customers and receive it from them and send pictures and get them back um that's I think a long way off and I'm looking forward to seeing how they allow us to build these different modalities into our systems that we sell even for my own platform agentive we now have this question of do we want to integrate audio and video and image and all these different things into our application and into our platform or do we want to just stick with text base and I think this is a conversation many of these platforms are going to be having um it's interesting to see how they play out and moving on from that to something closely related is the lagging consumer Behavior now we can have technology that moves ahead very fast and and early adopters kind of catch up if you've seen my uh my technology adoption curve video which I'll put up here somewhere while technology can race ahead the actual tastes and preferences and and behaviors of the the consumer populace take a lot longer to adjust and e-commerce is an example of this where it took a long time for people to become comfortable with putting the credit card online and now we do it like the thought of putting a credit card and giving it to some some random website was ludicrous back in if you go back far enough it was a completely silly idea and over time it took like decades for them to get to the point where it's okay yeah now now we all buy stuff online this is the same sort of thing with with AI and I think we're going to run into this GPT and and chat GPT may help with people getting used to speaking to these AI assistants and having conversations um but I think there's still a considerable lag in the actual consumer behaviors where if we're trying to sell these Solutions do our end customers actually want to be sending voice notes to WhatsApp do they want to be sending pictures and and giving videos to them and personally if historical preceden are anything to go off I'm not betting on this thing moving too fast next we have more of a technical one that I think could be an issue which is the image and video difficulties that come along with Building Systems around much more complex and varied inputs like text image and audio um in this example here you might have watched my prompt engineering video where I I highlighted the difference between conversational prompting and single shot prompting I'll put the video up there if you haven't watched it highly recommend it's very important for you to know how to do prompt engineering and it's not your regular video it's very very different we had some really good feedback on that there conversational prompting and then there single shot prompting for us as AI agencies in many cases we're working in this single shot range where we need to engineer The Prompt and engineer the system to be reliable and predictable and continue to give the same outputs over and over and over again um so that they can actually be built into a company and operate as a a artificial intelligence task that plugged into their systems and doing that with text only proves to be difficult enough as I'm sure some of you have found out but now we introduce a whole another layer of complexity of images and videos so imagine this example here of of an email classification system where there's a user and they fill out a contact form we get an email then we use prompt the GPT task on something like make.com to Output a label now imagine this instead of it being an email input it was a video from a customer or it was a was a photo of a of a damaged good that they got from from an e-commerce store there's so much more complexity in that than okay I can understand text but this is okay what's wrong with with the product from my own experience with vision models they are nowhere near good enough to be able to be baked into these kind of systems and be able to reliably perform so that's that's another concern that I have um for this new multimodal and Omni Channel or Omni model future that they're going for and finally what might seem very concerning to some of you is this plateau and intelligence um here's the model evaluation from open ai's blog post on the GPT 4 release and you can see the pink bars here a GPT 40 and it's about the it's about the same and it's not a massive Improvement you know it's it's very incremental look we're just edging up above gp4 turbo uh in most of these categories and yes this is a text evaluation I get that and they're really focused on being audio and video and things like this to give them credit if you go through these other tabs on the website I will leave a link to the blog down below um you can see that in uh in these audio and video different tests they are outperforming the the prim models and we are seeing much larger increases in capability and and intelligence but when it comes to the scores on the text evaluation which is what we typically determine as the the level of intelligence for getting questions right and reasoning things like this which is really crucial to the systems that we currently build we're plateauing um and we're seeing incremental improvements and this opens up to a much broader discussion about the state of generative Ai and and where the future's going to go and here's a look at the multilingual performance so you can see GPT 40 is better with different languages sure but again it looks fairly incremental it's not like this massive Leap Forward in intelligence um this idea that generative AI may be plateauing or we're reaching some kind of upper upper limit has been to some degree corroborated or or confirmed by re research paper and while this may look crazy on screen I I'll explain it basically um they have found that as they continue to increase the size and the amount of data that they train models on they seeing a a diminishing return um which may sound awful but give me a second to explain so I've actually a great video breaking this down is from I think they're called computer file I'll leave a link down below and as you can see on screen here there's three scenarios of generative Ai and and artificial intelligence and with these language models and the transform architecture they have three different scenarios say the one is the most exciting where as we continue to say on these on these axises sorry we have the number of examples in the training data set and then we have the performance or the Intelligence on the y- axis and in the first case if we continue to increase the number of examples in the training data set we get this exponential curve as you can see here of it's just runaway general intelligence and things get so much smarter and we put in a little bit more data and it gets way smarter then there's a more balanced or conservative one which is a a a linear relationship where more examples more data equals better performance and and greater intelligence but what they are starting to see as you can see from from this graph here is a potential uh worst case maybe not worst case but not the greatest case outcome um based off the evidence of this paper where we are seeing a flattening curve and as we continue to increase the examples it's flattening off and we're not getting any kind of meaningful increase on intelligence this is a little summary from that research paper which is there is a clear log linear trend for the models to get incrementally better at handling a concept that concept needs to appear exponentially more times in the training data this shows the models are very data inefficient which may sound concerning to you as someone who's just bit their whole life on this AI space and continued advancements um and I guess the question is has generative AI peaked um and I think this is an important one to ask but personally I'm betting on this being a temporary Plateau where the architecture and the Transformer that we currently use is kind of maxing out and and we've pushed as far as we can we've got great capabilities we have an awesome set of new technology to use and Implement into businesses um and we've just attracted the entire every smart brain on the planet has has flooded into the space as as you are here watching this video interested in the space and we have the greatest researchers in Minds all going into it humans are not done with artificial intelligence by no by any means we're not just going to go oh well well we've got the missing returns right I'm out like okay I guess we can't get any smarter than that so that's complete rubbish so we're going to continue to keep pushing and just like the transformer architecture blasted open the scene for us to be able to get to this point um when GPT 3 released we're going to continue to see people innovate and try to create smarter architectures that are more efficient on training with that data so we could be looking at a a little Plateau a nice little bit of room to catch our breath and and I honestly think that that is going to be very very good for the space as the AAA and the AI automation agency space as a whole because if if the the tech keep kept taking off and it just got better and better and better and every 6 months we had whole bunch of new stuff to try and adapt to with we don't ever get a chance to really catch our breath and solidify our solution so this is something that I've I've been kind of excited for to some degree where I get questions on the channel which is oh but like what if what if the like why why do they need our Solutions why would they ever need to use us if if the thing just going to get so good that suddenly they can type one word and then it just automates their whole business that that is a a very low percentage outcome like in terms of probability and if this is anything to go by we're not going to get there anytime soon so we have a chance now to say okay yes people have dropped out of the space they've gone off they've chased other other shiny objects we now have a chance to really work on our craft really work on identifying these use cases and going into businesses and finding ways that AI can help them and we get a nice Runway now before things take off again to dial in our services to get experience and to continue to push ourselves further and further away from The Spectators who sit there and watch AI news to the people who are actually taking action like you and I I hope they give you a little bit more clarity about what this update means for us as AI agency owners I do not like being an AI News Channel but when there's big updat from open AI um it is worthwhile coming in here and hopefully giving you guys a bit of insight into what this means for us if you have enjoyed the video hit down below and leave a like um

holding you doing no way mate that's was F you do that as low Cody is just going to go on a make.com and set up a we hook and then just fire it off as a little test system but our coaches are going to be really key for that they call it like smart data is kind of the buzz word at the moment um and these systems are I mean you can sell them for like $80 $100,000 or more [Music] see how this thing oh jeez it's pretty hefty yeah yeah it's relatively big just because he had other tools that he wanted to be included as [Music] well so what we're trying to do is distill down the benefits of creating a personal brand so the video is going to be should you start out YouTube everyone's like oh should Liam's doing it should I do it but I think everyone should be starting a personal brand this early in the space um I think it'd be stupid not to and it seems like so many people are getting getting clients the same way that I have through through the personal brand so it's not should you start a YouTube in AI space you're going to redt them into like which platform should you choose I think I'll lay out the problem of look the problem of starting these businesses is you need to create value for the so in order to do that you must solve a real problem and in order to solve a real problem you must either guess or like try to figure out yourself or you get feedback from people who are experiencing problem they'll tell you [Music] [Music] it now it's 20 years later someone fall across the ocean here I am chilling with the homies some Dr [ __ ] thank God that I made it this far if it wasn't for my driver then [Music] I this is some apocalyptic little bro the end of the world bro holy sh reported live from the end of the world oh BR you can't even see the tower boomsday little stuff [Music] [Music] all ofs shine that's all that's part of and like the more conversations part of what me and Joshua working to do today is just optimize for that feedback you want to take the most efficient route to to success is going to be being able to line up your learning with your marketing you know yeah I mean the first step us some like this especially when it's kind of important important things going on like you don't want to be doing false representations in the in zero is the first step of a co-pilot that's just mentioned which is okay let's make something similar to a custom tvt where you can go through this process upload the document it's going extract things out and say hey look these are the things I'm about to insert can you give me all clear once you're able to identify that and have a sort of a human relop system then you can have a more of okay just drop it in there and until we know do the right job we have a sales call we great accy firm they need lots of stuff uh I think we can help them so yeah that bang out got another meeting now it is 8:22 still gone still gone I have a design meeting for Gen now um with our product on morning side and uh we need final way of design for our UI overhaul we're doing a big relaunch so very excited for that and yeah good sales no no go ahead please um do we want to have like a auto increment thing where it's like I don't know V V1 and then like whenever they publish again it goes to V2 and then to V3 and then to V4 and it's just very like incremental like that I think as long as we just put this box as a copyable uh prompt box and then uh we have the model and then I think we just add in a little section maybe it's like another box or something or I don't know how you do it but uh just have okay files included uh names of files included name name name and then like uh names of tools and tools included tool tool tool so yeah looking forward to to seeing all this done it's pretty cool I say the status bit is still missing so they're working on the logic right now okay get to bit but um yeah thanks thanks for working this right that is our product owner Mato and he is uh leading the the agenda of uiux design and he's from he's at meta he's he works at meta Facebook um and we're kind of like sniping him on the side at the moment and have been for the past couple months but uh yeah he's one of our top tier guys who works at morning site so hopped on there went through some with the UI for agentive which we're doing a big overhaul I'm not sure you guys will probably be getting a a sneak peek look at this cuz uh this is not going live for another another month or so um and even then uh you got to have early access to it so uh very exciting stuff AG gent have needed a lot of work uh I know but this is our first s and we're definitely learning as we go um it's a lot more work than you think and there's a lot more money that needs to be poured in than uh as well vlog's done pretty happy with it going to keep it going get to bed I was so tired today so tired today so I should probably not stay up till 11:30 and get up at 6:30 again if I can help it so I just posted the Vlog and um was trying to go to bed and then got a nice little message from Taha maybe sort of a little bit emotional um so T was in the Vlog and he flew out from Canada to uh Amsterdam to come to the event and uh this is what he just sent me just finished that Vlog oh my God it's so sick um yeah I just want to jump in here real quick and tell you that it's been an absolute pleasure learning from you and learning with you as well and I I can't wait to do it again bro yeah just thank you for everything all the help that you've been these last however long it's been almost a year now it's been nothing but a pleasure and seeing you guys grow and seeing this whole Community grow is genuinely amazing so thanks for everything you're doing keep doing it bro you're killing it and uh yeah till next time it's pretty cool um yeah I just want I throw that in there know those little things um kind of shows you the impact you're making um so I don't know if sometimes you feel like a couple negative comments can outweigh hundreds of people who feel like that yeah I think I'm stuck Nostalgia my minding the times when So Divine but I was feeling like without you going to probably go a little bit into the AI like Market the whe got the market which is this like box of people somewhere around you got these old black blogs of organisms which we can businesses organic chicken breast organic chicken Hots and then organic eggs with Organic Raw butter I think and a little bit of salt real estate how you beat the case put them work turn that [ __ ] to the office see when you're head in those dips you can either hit it with the triceps or focusing on the chest you know chest day today so I'm Hing more of a like a half rep range just working the pick rather than tiing out me uh triceps on necessarily cuz these bad boys get out long before the chest does he's got a taste of those YouTube promotions and he can't get enough now but everything's going to more personal brand now rather than like brand Pages which is kind of interesting thing I've got one my prompt engineering video going on tomorrow you guys should watch it's kind of kind of funny I'm uh taking a very different approach with it but I think that's kind of where things are moving anyway was enjoy the rest of your week have a good weekend I'll catch you Legend uh next week ciao I'm the only one that's earning so let me do what I want want of having the the office and the base somewhere is really really it right it's so much more filling yeah it's the fillment I'm making money but like I'm not I'm not really happy like like relationships yeah cuz you know gr contribution from Tony Robin and St like you don't have you build relationships on a zoom with your team or M them and SL them I don't know if you would have heard much of those conversations cuz I felt I didn't want to be recording these guys necessarily um cuz I I don't hang out with them very often I've me first time meeting a lot of those guys down there but uh my plat mate Adam is uh very well connected here he's got a great Network um and he's kind enough to to introduce me to the right people cuz here in Dubai you get a lot of you got to a lot of [ __ ] people I'm going to be honest um guys who are riding around Lambos they're here like [ __ ] dodging all sorts of stuff running sketchy businesses and I mean I'm here to build my business and focus and be out of my home City and be exposed to better opportunities be more Central in the world to the places that I want to be but um there are good people here I mean I'd like to think I'm a pretty good person and I'm here so therefore there must also be other good people I mean Adam is I've met other good friends here too so it's just if you want to do Dubai how do you do it in a way that you find the right people um and it's not easy it's not easy at all you have to come to your own conclusion so having exposure to the extremes on either side and sort of the moderates and you can build up your own worldview of how the world actually works um if you but if you're not exposing yourself to different people from different backgrounds and older people and younger people and everything in between um you're never going to have enough data to make an accurate decision should on how you should live your life as well see see so that was the founder instantly the email soft no he's one of our neighbors here in Dubai just like a a tower just over no great dude great Network in Dubai as you can tell I mean man just looking at rewrites the user queries to optimize him for search rank search results to pick the most relevant ones before generating the final response shout out shout out Sam I mean at the end of the day so in terms of us connecting to that do we want to provide many customization features on thatc how do we want from I got a little Little Couple notes Here the good news is that they're working on the systems API which is extremely good news because for a moment they we thought that they might have been kind of like phing a little bit maybe getting slow updates but they've updated gp4 turbo which is great they have updated this with the 10,000 documents now they've completely rebuilt their their knowledge base that was a conversation with my business partner Josh uh breaking down the open AI update that came out last night which basically revamped the entire knowledge based system and our s agentive is built on top of the assistance API and they've just put in a feature that we were basically working over the past 2 to 3 weeks but thankfully it came now and not uh a month later when we completed it and for the relaunch we wanted to have these features included but now we can do more more features tailored to agencies which is really our [Music] focus in regards to obviously I think you mentioned even just getting a couple of days first of all I'm not sure what aspect that was on but a couple of days first of all to get our team in and provide a little bit of Consulting on sort of architecture and PR management and all that sort of stuff and then I guess uh on potential Solutions as well and thanks for the project that you did for me uh I hope I was probably easy customer comp to some people yes Li are there any other notes on your side in terms of extracting those entities out and then running sort of tools on them um no issue there uh just be a little bit of an exploration on on the integration you can get into into lsmith if we're going to be using that as a platform to how we can kick that out to different places collect more data and pull it back in he's a good dude bro I was just sitting there thinking how cool is this we've built something for a guy he's come back with even B deal cuz he knows where the he's like where the guys that that can do it from him I mean he knows some of those those clients that are just cool and you're like grateful to be working with them and like the B I'm sitting there talking about building these systems for startups it's like it's just cool you know and I've never had a business or a thing that was like cool like this I guess e-commerce when you're putting money in and seeing the number go up is kind of cool but not that kind of cool not like there's this person you really respect and enjoy doing work with and you're engag in a symbiotic relationship where you're both making money I mean it's not doesn't get much better than that guys so he's a he's a past client of ours who's now come back because he was so happy with what we built for him and he's coming back with bigger deals and connections to all this this network of people that he can access to so I got go work one first um feel like we got a pretty good holding pattern here now I was quite uh quite anxious for the past past couple weeks I'd say you know how with um what's his name with we couldn't copy over chat conversations so we couldn't duplicate a single we can do that now that was so hidden in there that I didn't even notice it thank you for spotlighting that sir cuz that's that is actually massive too this is what we've been waiting for and this what we've been begging for and it's finally here [Music] that was a bit of a Vibe got some good news about potentially going off to an event tonight I don't know how much of it I can film or how

              "text": "hey guys Liam otley here and today I have a super valuable video for you all where we're going to be breaking down a real world case study of someone in our community using just one YouTube video to generate over $110,000 worth of potential leads for the AI agency so we're going to be jumping in and breaking down exactly how he was able to get these kind of results what he could have done better and at the end of the video I'll be giving you a step-by-step blueprint on how you can do the same if you are new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I'm the founder of my own AI agency called morning side AI I'm also the creator of the AI automation agency model as a whole or AAA as we call it and on this channel I teach people how to start and scale their own AAA so jumping into things here I have a big mirror board that we need to cover today a lot to cover at the end here I have your step-by-step blueprint so that's really what you're waiting for but we have a lot to cover before then so starting off we have an inbound marketing case study of my friend jannis Moore um jannis is actually a member of my closed AI content creators group so I've kind of rounded up a couple key guys in the space that I think are really good and doing good things in the space and they're actually meeting me in in Dubai in a week or two for a mastermind that we're doing so solid dude knows his stuff very smart and he actually has his own channel here as you can see and I want to use him as a case study of showing how small channels and not just myself with my big number next to my name that I've I've had to do a lot of work to get there smaller people who are starting YouTube channels or even just Linked In in smaller platforms can still win big in the AAA Space by doing the right things and jannis has done it right and we're going to be breaking down in this video exactly how he's done that so jannis here you can see he's got his channel jannis more AI automation he has 31,000 subscri subscribers 59 videos and this is the video that we're going to be talking about in particular that was able to generate him over $110,000 of potential earnings not actual earnings he hasn't made 100 Grand from one video but he has attracted 21 leads to his business through his contact form and other methods as we're going to go into and it only took him 3 hours to create this video really 1 hour to plan it as you'll see later I've actually got an interview with him that I'm going to insert later in this video so he's going to tell us a little bit more about how he did this and what worked for him it only took him 2 hours to film you can see here that it's an hour and 20 minutes long and we're going to jump into that in a second but here's the high level overview he's got 21 leads so far and these are at an average value of around $55,000 so before I can give you some kind of step-by-step strategy on replicating this you need to understand YouTube organic as a as a platform for acquiring customers for your agency now this is actually the whole thing here is kind of an except from the YouTube organic module that I'm doing within my program so if you guys are from the accelerator don't worry you're going to be getting a a massive module full of this and and much much more um but I wanted to release this on the channel as I saw jannis as example and thought that's a cool way of doing a little case study for you guys here on the channel as well so you guys are going to get a sneak peek or a sneak preview of the stuff that I'm sharing in the accelerator so first things first in order to succeed with getting clients in the same way yanis says is to understand YouTube as a platform and how you can use it to acquire customers um now I've learned this and experienced this over the past 12 to 14 months I never thought I'd be a YouTuber you probably didn't think you would either um but I think after this video you might be changing in mine because I've generated over 1,500 leads for my agency I counted it up the other day so jannis is is done 20 within 7 days you guys can do the same but you need to understand how this works on a fundamental level so this funnel here is breaking down how Impressions on YouTube are converted into closed deals and how you can uh the sort of components as well that we need to understand that convert people from stage to Stage so starting off at the top when you post a YouTube video like Yannis post this an AI phone assistant in 2 hours YouTube goes okay I'm going to try and show that video to some people in this case Yannis has got 33 uh 3,300 views 3.3k and there's usually about a a 5 to 6% conversion rate of uh people who are showing the video and the views that it actually gets so I'm assuming it's been shown to around 50,000 people here and so when YouTube shows your videos to people it's then up to the title and thumbnail of the video that you've posted to convert people from Impressions into views so if they click on the video because the thumbnail is appealing it catches their eye thumbnail is usually the first thing and then the title is what they read after so thumbnail catches the attention title converts it into a bit of interest and then they go through and they click onto the video so if video click through click through rate is what converts Impressions into views and then in order to convert views into uh link clicks or website visitors sorry the the end goal of this obviously is to get closed deals and clients for your agency but there's a couple steps in between that so you need to then convert those views into people who actually go on and visit your website and so what does this is these these key things here so as soon as people click on the video they are hit with the hook of your video so at the start of this video I had a hook explaining what I'm going to cover um the value that you can expect from it Etc and then the actual content of the video is is building up trust and saying is this guy an idiot or not and at the end or somewhere through it you need to have a call to action or or a CTA and this combination of factors is what's going to determine whether people view your video and then end up clicking on the link in your description to visit your website um there's also the the description itself which we'll go into in a second but the way that you lay out your description will also determine how many people are able to click over to your website with interest to to start working with you now as a whole um the things we're optimizing for when we create videos is this description click through rate how many people can we convert from viewers so once they've watched the video and they like what they've seen and they're interested in working with you because you've made a call to action saying hey if you want to work with me you can click the link in the description down they come to being a website visitor so they land on your website and they have a look around and in this case you might get a 1% conversion rate from views to link clicks or website visitors which would be pretty good um and then you have your website conversion rate which is going to determine how many of those website visitors convert into engage leads how many of them are reaching out to you and saying hey I'm interested in your services so while in this case Yan has only got 10 form submissions on his website which I'm going to break down his funnel uh shortly just over over here so hold fire for that but in total it was 21 leads and this is how they came in so firstly it was an email there was 10 of them come from a a web form submission on his website four came from direct Outreach via his YouTube um business email so there's the email that he has on his profile um two came through Linkedin and five came through Instagram which is which is pretty interesting considering he do push that anywhere and it's not really a major platform for him so then from these 10 people who submitted the form on his website I'm actually making it the total 21 here Jan's decided to book in four calls because he's been quite picky and here you get your qualification rate so are these people actually qualified or are the people I can help do they have the budget are they in the right Niche Etc um the qualification rate will determine how much is of of this is is is crap basically you might get a ton of AI agency owners hitting you up I get a bunch of people using my contact form on morning side to try and ask me questions about how to start an agency I'm sure Jan's got it too off this video of people who are wanting to sell voice AI Solutions but in short you're not going to get everyone who's is qualified for a call and so you're going to see a bit of a drop off here as well now from these calls not all of the deals are going to go through and so you might get two to four of them closed out of that and what affects this the conversion from booking in a discovery call into a closed deal are things like your offer and your brand and positioning which we're going to go into in a little bit as well and if you watch my recent video on I don't I always forget which side to put it on it'll be up there on exploration milestones and how you can uh drastically increase your close rate for your agency uh the expiration Milestone can be a real key key tool to tool to use here at least that's what I use at my agency so as a whole this system is converting The Impressions that YouTube is is sending out it's putting your videos in front of people and you're trying to optimize to get it down to closed deals at the end and there's certain key points along the way that you can address and focus on to try to push up these metrics so with that high level overview of YouTube organic uh acquisition we can jump into uh things like breaking down this video in particular so obviously if you're going to try to create YouTube content you need to have a topic you need to have some kind of value that you're given away or some Focus area in this case jannis was doing it on uh voice AI systems which I've been talking about a lot and so we can break down this topic and why he was able to get um in this case 3,300 views but also the 20 leads that he's got off at so far helpful thing to do when analyzing these Trends is to look at basic stuff like Google Trends and here you can see over the past four 5 months voice AI has really been heating up and I've been talking about this constantly on the channel in fact you can see that I've made four videos on this now with all these different voice AI systems when you look at trends like this where there's more and more interest coming into the space you can see prior examples of people in the space making videos like this and getting views then it's safe to say that it's if you are to make some kind of good content in that area then you will get views and there is a tension so um voice AI was clearly trending um and I think it's still fairly early in my opinion I think this is just I mean the whole world can really use this stuff basically any business on the planet can benefit from some kind of voice AI system so now is just going a time any to get in and create content and I think these kind of long form videos are going to do very well so jannis has has been quite strategic and doing the long form video as well so jannis had some data of the stuff working already which is great and then he was able to come in and make an hour and 21 minute long video um that's addressed at beginners so long video typically means lots of value this is what worked for him I think and it's ideal for beginners when you make a longer video I've done a lot on my channel and they perform very well because someone who's new to AI wants to feel like they're being being walk step by step and not compressed down and skipping Key Parts so so very long videos showing you every step of the way is more appealing to beginners and the beginner Market on YouTube on anything the beginners represent the top of the final in any kind of um any skill right so you're going to have the most people at the top and the most people are going to be beginners that means you're going to have bigger potential reach and a wider Market of people who can watch your video and get value from it so there's also this Loom Style part of the thumbnail which shows quite a Hands-On tutorial you can see him here showing you what you're doing which is is signaling to people that this is going to be a tutorial and when it comes to YouTube it's about matching their expectations when they click on a video you need to match the expectations like when you clicked on this video the thumbnail is going to present some kind of implied experience of the video and in this case he's showing an implied experience of a 2hour tutorial showing you how to do a step by step which is again appealing to beginners um and in the video he's actually got a call to action at the end which is saying you can get in touch with me with my link in the description so I'll leave a link um here's this video here I'll leave a link to the video down below if you want to go watch it and see how we did it but that's a that's a summary of the video itself and the trend that it was built upon then we can actually start to break down his funnel so how is he converting this attention going back to this how is he converting this these Impressions and these views into link clicks and people landing on his site so that he can try to funnel them down towards being en closed deals so as I said at the end of the video he had a call to action where he was saying hey if you want to work with me or you're interested in these solutions for your business you can contact me below and down in the description we have this here which is a nice description link to the resources he mentioned so I believe he's capturing emails doing that which is a good way to start building a list as well um but then he has this worked with us uh link as well which directly goes to his website here so it's good description short and sweet not too many links um and then it's got a link to work with us here which takes to his website up the top right is a contact us button which takes visitors down to the contact form and they're able to fill in the subject of the inquiry the name email budget how they can help you Etc so that's the funnel as it stands and we're going to go into ways that he could have improved this a little later and so at this stage once I've submitted that form you can see that we're now at this form submission part and now we need to do some kind of qualifying to determine who we want to get on calls with and then we can try to close those from there so the qualification rate of these inbound leads into people that you actually want to hop on calls with is entirely up to you in your agency and how you want to run it whether you want to be taking on a couple big clients a month which are a bit more custom or simpler ones that are sort of faster and easy to do I've covered this in a video on my 5 to $105,000 client which I put a link to up here so you can understand the difference between the different sizes of clients cuz done 5K to $100,000 and everything in between different sizes of clients have different baggage Associated so you need to decide what kind of client you're trying to get out of these inbound leads then once you get on the Discovery call with one of these qualified leads it's up to you to present a good offer and have good brand and positioning in order to close them because they're not going to end up signing with you if they don't trust you or believe that you can deliver what you say you're going to do whether you are the guy for the job and this comes down to the offer for one if you can put some kind of guarantee on it that's going to help you to close it but for most of us if you're looking to do YouTube organic and an inbound marketing like this a lot of it's going to come down to your brand and your positioning so using me as an example people can look at my YouTube channel and see I've got a lot of subscribers and I and I get views on my videos and I've got lots of knowledge on the topic because I talk about it like this that builds a lot of trust and really helps my positioning to get those deals closed on the call so in this case we can analyze janis's brand his personal brand across platforms on YouTube of course we have a clearly specializing in AI automation on his banner and and profile he has a link in his bio so they can contact him if they want and I think most importantly here he has been consistently posting on YouTube and he has a track history of covering specifically AI voice solution so as you can see here he's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven seven videos on AI voice in the past month so this is really going to help with his positioning when he gets on those calls and having some kind of authority and yes I'm the guy for the job I've shown that I know this stuff inside out I can do this for you and it's really going to build that trust with the customer or with the potential client and then looking at other platforms as well it's important to be congruent cuz as you saw back here um he didn't just get all of them through his uh his website he actually got two through Linkedin and then five of them came through Instagram so you guys need to be cautious and and aware that people are going to look at you on multiple Platforms in this case he had it in the bio he had his LinkedIn and his Instagram so make sure if you're putting that stuff in your bio the profile is optimized towards presenting the right kind of the right side of you that you want your potential clients to see so over here here we can see that his LinkedIn is very professional um nice B very clearly shows that he's Ai and he's doing certain things there's a bio as well so very good on the LinkedIn side also here on Instagram it's consistent and congruent with the channel branding as well so he's over here posting about ways that you can do AI automations for your business Etc and continues to build upon the authority that he's built with his YouTube channel and I mean it's not he's got 3,000 subscribers he's got a few hundred connections on here and he's got 300 followers on Instagram so this any of you are still thinking that oh Liam can't do YouTube or I can't do nbound marketing because I mean Liam he's got all these subscribers and he's been doing it for a long time 300 followers and these guys are reaching out five people reached out after seeing that and saying yes this is still my guy so there's no excuse for you guys to to not commit 1 2 3 4 months to trying to build up some kind of following on any of these platforms and start to do marketing like this and positioning yourself as an expert because it goes to show that you don't need a massive audience to be able to generate high quality leads and large volume of leads next I want to jump into a bit of a an analysis of how we could have done things better I know in janis's case he's not really looking to to optimize and maximize how much money he's making from these kind of these deals that come out of the channel he's working on a on a SAS at the moment I believe and it's going to be in the AI voice space so he's kind of funneling them into the channel and getting attention for that this way but if this was one of your channels and I was sitting down helping you this is the kind of changes that I would I would make to improve this funnel and make it perform better firstly on the video and content side I think changing the title to being clearly a beginner's guide would uh allow it to tap into a bigger audience um and also statements work better than questions so in this case it could be uh how to create an AI phone assistant complete beginner guide I think in here saying it's 2 hours when it is an hour an hour 20 you're making it sound longer than it actually is um which might be might be an issue you could probably run that down to 1 hour but at least in my experience if you're going to put time in the title it should be as small as possible so you see some of my videos it's like how to build X in in 3 minutes so the shorter you make it the better that's the changes I'd make to the title and then for the thumbnail I'd be simplifying it down a bit more to be just one or two components Max so myself and then one or two things it might be some words and then one image or icon the more layers you add into the thumbnail um the more compx it becomes and the less less Clarity they have to okay this is what the video is actually about um and finally I'd add more call to action throughout the video so if you're really trying to optimize for as many people clicking through your website as possible he's left it to the end of an hour 21 to say hey you can work with me I'll probably mention it at the start just before they jumped into it like hey if you're interested in doing this uh you can contact me below I'd also put a couple little popups at bottom um throughout the video maybe one or two just saying hey if you're interested in these Services contact me below cuz they might get to that part in the tutorial and go like oh this is really hard and then that pops up perfect timing they go down and click and instead of them trying to do it themselves they just come to you for it perfect presenting this solution to the problem as soon as they experience it kind of thing then for the description I'll be changing this work with us as you can see over here it says work with us and then it has this link I'd be changing it to something stronger a stronger call to action um something like interested in AI voice solutions for your business work with me here and then link as you can see on my morning side AI Channel which is what we use to generate leads for our business mainly now um you can see you're interested in exploring what AI can do for your business get in touch with the morning side AI team here so this is what I use for my business when I'm making content specifically targeted at getting business leads for us obviously here on this channel I'm more focused towards helping you guys start your agencies um so I don't need to have that strong call to action um I'd also be moving the link up to being the first link so people are going to dig people are going to dig down for those resources no matter what because that's what they came for so you can get your link to work with us right at the top it's a very minor change um but you can technically put this link to the resources further down and they're going to have to walk past they're going to have to look past your work with us and your My Links Etc and there's a high chance of them clicking on that that link first and finally I'll be setting up tracking links to determine which videos are sending the most traffic to my website um I have a a platform over here um called blink bl. is what I use it's a link short and a like bitly but you can do multiple links to the same address um so that's what I use and you can put a unique tracking link um with each video so here we could have if you're interested in AI voice Solutions contact us here and that's a unique link where he can track the number of clicks from this video specifically and that comes back to this YouTube fnal breakdown which is okay what are we actually optimizing for here what is the the Target and what's the goal of each piece of content we put out how can we determine the success and primarily for YouTube videos yes we are trying to get closed deals at the end but the most the closest thing to our YouTube content being successful and a metric that we can measure is to attract people to click on the video and then convert those viewers into website viewers through our hook our content our call to action our description so this is really what we're optimizing for so if you start to measure on the video level the amount of clicks that are coming through and you can do the same thing with LinkedIn post Etc you can go okay yes this video got 1,000 views but I got 100 link clicks and I got five calls booked or it got 10,000 views but it only got 50 link clicks so you may be distracted and say oh but these things are getting more views so it must be better for my business but at the end of the day if you're using this to get leads and to to get clients for your agency you need to be looking at what's actually the needle so this has been helpful for me and my business as well in changing around how we optimize our content rather than trying to reach half a million people I'd rather reach 10 to 20,000 people of my core audience who are going to be uh better better people for for what I'm trying to do so heading back over here set up the tracking links that's one for the description and then the website so on this website here you can see that it's it's similar to what I have at morning II which is kind of a a a billboard for the company saying what we do uh making us look really good and really professional and now while these are handy for putting on profiles and people naturally finding your site I think if you have like mornings side. it should be one of these star websites but if you're trying to convert as optimally as possible people from viewers into close deals this is coming back again to this part yes now we've got them onto the website what can we change about our website conversion rate that's going to be the landing page itself so instead of having a very Broad and very general website that looks like this we we can convert it into a landing page that's more like a funnel that has a a video sales letter or vssl on it and in this you could have a case study saying this is an example of a client that we just did this with my name is jannis I do this or my name is Liam and I'm expert in this I've been doing it for a while you get a chance to tell your story and why and build that trust so that they're more likely to book a call with you and when they get on that call they're more likely to sign with you because they know more about and more context about you and your expertise so converting the link in the description to stand to a landing page like this would be something that I would change I'd also have a cly booking link on the page here so that they can book directly in with you and then you can go through and and put screening questions you can say what's your budget Etc and if they're not a certain budget you can say okay sorry I'm not interested in working with you and you just ignore those those guys are not qualified anymore and also for you guys who were just starting as I mentioned if you making YouTube content you're going to get both AI agency owners like you guys here and you're also going to get business owners so you get a mix of both these qualifying questions that you can put on your caly page will be helpful to say what kind of business do you run and they'll say oh I run an AI agency then you can say sorry man I'm not I'm not interested in in giving away my source on how I'm selling these Solutions you can go and figure it out for yourself I've made the video but you're not going to get on a call with me I only take calls with business own who I can actually sell to and you also get a lot of guys like hey I want a partner partner means they want to get you to do it for free and not pay and so if they're asking to partner please be very careful to not waste a lot of time talking to them um because they might just be tie kickers and wasting your time and finally here as I said normal websites are good for having on your profiles and letting people find you organically uh but they're not really optimized for conversion cuz people have to come on here and click contact us and fill it out it's not exactly optimized for uh retaining people and converting website visitors into leads now finally before we get into the step-by-step guide here I've just had a qu cool with yest where he breaks down some really interesting things we can jump into that now yeah awesome so I'd say the success of the video actually was pretty pre-planned kind of because I started working with vapi like one and a half month before that since I basically started integrating that into my own Sal product and I just gained so much knowledge that I said yeah why not just share that with the world you know I'm anyways in the AI space and make some videos about it and then I just use vid IQ to figure out which kind of keywords work well what are people looking for and then I released that first video about the the difference of a a static assistant and transient based assistant on AP which everyone just loved and that was the moment when I realized ah okay there's actually some really good demand there and from there I started making more videos about it and I think the the strategy is literally just super simple just bring out value like I delivered value that they could just Implement without much of the technical knowledge and they loved it and I think that's why they come back M yeah I mean you went I think that's your first video that you did the big hourong kind of style um how much planning how much planning went into that beforehand cuz you made it something that you're kind of freestyling it but I know there's always a bit of a set up beforehand so how much time did you actually invest so we can calculate okay that's how much time is required to make a content of this of this level um and this the kind of results that we can get once we've sort of talled up your your leads yeah well if you would say for the video itself I would probably say not more than one one and a half hours but for the knowledge that I gathered with it it was probably like one one and a half month okay so you just not just like half time I was literally working most of the time with vippy with voice AI agents figuring out how they work so yeah that's that's it so so would you recommend going deep on on one particular area like this um for other people who looking to rip 100% because in the end it is just about what you master because the the small nuances are What What In the End matter so if you just Niche down to one thing you can still deliver a super super great service to them which they will be very happy with right MH and and I know you're busy with your with your SS how many of these leads are you actually and take on o that's a very good question I'm I'm trying Pi the best ones yeah yeah I mean I have I have Partners we know through YouTube really cool other guys that are very good in the industry and just partnering up trying to serve as many people as possible so we can get them as many value value as we possibly can and I'll just take on the more complex stuff the one that's really interesting for me where I have to dive deep where I have to actually figure out find some new areas to connect things to and this is just just where I'm literally just validating I'd say from all of the leads I'm getting in it's probably less than 3% that I'm actually like really taking on seriously and so if you were to give advice to to another an aspiring young uh AAA owner how would you recommend that they they go about creating content like this what a step by step you give them I'd say the first thing is do your research on the topic do your research on one tool that you actually work with where you can see value in it where you can see that other people maybe even do something and you know yourself yeah with a dedication you can get some similar result or probably even better than that and you literally just dive into the document a figure out all of the nuances talk with their support try to get as many value as you can out of them so that you can leverage that inside of your business and I think once you have done that you have the pretty solid basement to actually already start making videos about it right because then you also know where the pitfalls are where people are struggling with you get a better understanding of that you can learn from you can look at at your failures or like the problems that you've figured out and make content about that and this is basically how you can get started and how you actually find a I say a community that actually makes sense mhm yeah I think that's it's a really good way of doing it if you could just pick an area and start to start to dig into it more and as you're going there's something that I should probably be doing more often as well is noting down the the struggles that I have um and then you can just piece that together into in your case something that I've done on the channel to great success now you're doing it as well just those massive videos it's like everyone needs to begin a guide the AI space these all mistakes so it's it's a win for all of us right if we if we make a mistake we share with others maybe we avoid it for even one or two other people to make the same thing so mhm it's it's just pure value which I like a lot awesome yianis that's been a massive help um it's great to get you into the video that I'm uh I'm hyping you up so much so I appreciate you man and I'm sure Community will be checking out your channel as well all right now we can get into a step-by-step guide on how you can actually do this for yourself how you can start to generate leads within marketing so first off as Jana said he spent a month learning a particular Topic in this case he was learning voice Ai and vapy in particular so he spent a month learning that and then he said it only took him 1 hour to plan the video so it's a month of learning and then an hour of planning for that video so first things first you need to pick something to learn whether that's going to be Voice assistance or Bland AI in particular or vapy AI or anything or might be assistance API and building text-based agents it might be doing automations but you got to pick something look at the trends that are going on in the space voice AI this assistance API that you've got lots of different options in the market just do a bit of research and pick something that you want to learn and start to specialize in initially now you need to go out and actually learn this thing that starts with going onto YouTube and searching up the topic and saying how to build x with y ing all of these videos building your own projects learning something and along the way take notes as Jana said of the tricky Parts where you can be the bridge and the guide to help people through that in future when you start to make your content then once you've got a good base don't wait too long you have to start at some point don't wait 3 6 months trust me it's within a month of of hard work on a topic you're going to know more than 99% of people you're ready to start making videos and teaching other people how to build cool stuff I mean I don't need to make it much more complex than that but just build cool things follow your own interest and things that you are interested in building and once you build that package it into a video and share it then you can give away cool resources as well as the value that makes them come back each time so when you give away the value you can be capturing emails as Yannis is and as I did on my free resource Hub I have a email list of 60,000 people now because when I was doing this process I was giving away free value and I was making them give me their email and exchange for the value so you can build an email list start a regular newsletter talking about the solutions that you're building great way to start building up a a pool of of people that you get to Market to on your own lists and when it comes to video ideas I can spoon feed you some of these right now this is what's worked for me in my channel how to X complete beginner's guide again beginners top of funnel most people how to do X and Y minutes if you can make X as valuable as possible and Y as low as possible then you're going to be getting a lot of value um then the people watching the videos are going to be getting a lot of value in a small amount of time which is great for people with short attention spans then you can do things like Advanced guide to X now I know I said beginners is best but there's actually a big poll of people who crave advanced stuff as well and you can see on my channel I've got like 200,000 views on a video that's an advanced guide gpts cuz people actually do crave stepping up to something something more more more difficult and also testing their skills and people naturally overvalue their level of of expertise and their skills So when you say Advanced guide everyone kind of thinks that they can be an advanced guide to some degree so we've also got five ways to use x in your business so five ways to use voice AI systems or voice AI bots in your business helpful listicle people like list based videos and finally how to solve how to solve common problem you faced during this process that you noted down in X minutes so whether you're doing vapy or voice AI how to solve this painful little problem in X minutes so you can get a couple quick videos out really start to build out your channel so that you've got 5 10 20 different videos on the same topic and then finally you need to start directing that traffic to some kind of basic website or landing page that allows them to book calls in with you as I said you can use something like bl. K blink this is what I use because bitly doesn't allow you to send multiple links to the same address so I've just use this other one works fine for me so you can determine what content is actually converting people from viewers into websit visitors and you can use something like card or clickfunnels to create a very quick website don't waste too much time on it um as we've shown before if you're just trying to convert people from visitors into uh booked calls you don't need anything crazy just a landing page with a short video view or some kind of slideshow that you've presented um and that's going to help them to convert website visitors into book calls so that's the step by step I think you can figure it out from there but pick something to learn learn it take notes make videos give away value give away resources collect those emails direct them to the website give it into calls and start closing them from there that's all for the video I hope this has been helpful Yannis is just one example of inbound marketing methods working for AI agencies right now we have tons of people in the accelerator who are all pivoting over to using LinkedIn or YouTube and they're successfully generating leads using these inbound marketing methods which is attracting those early adopters by putting yourself out there making content that people want to see and they don't that they're going to click on I'm an example of it my whole career here has been based off me making videos and attracting business to me you guys can do the exact same thing it's not that hard if you don't want to be a YouTuber just s on it for a bit you don't have to do YouTube you can do other platforms but YouTube is the best one for it right now and all you need to do is spend a month or two learning a topic and start to share on that so this miror board I'm going to leave a link to it um on my free school community so if you want to jump on there there'll be a link in description for school um there'll also be a link to janis's channel down below if you want to check him out solid guy very smart and something you guys should be watching as well if you guys have anything else that you want me to cover that you're struggling with with your agencies be sure to let me know down below cuz I do read the comments and I'll be checking those out so you might see videos addressing that at a later date but that's all for the video thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

              "text": "hey guys Le wle here and in this video I'll be breaking down the simple change that I made in my agency to allow us to scale past 10K per month and how you can do the exact same in yours it's relatively easy it's just a simple tweak within the sales process but it made a complete like a world of difference for us in terms of our closing rates and the amount of effort and and time we're putting into dealing with people who are never going to pay us any money anyway so this is something that I've I talk a lot about in my accelerator but I thought I'd bring it out here and do a sort of a a white boy session on YouTube so that you guys can get some of the some of the source as well cuz it's so and made such a massive difference for us so this is a a graph here showing that you keep getting stuck at the 10K per month Mark um a bunch of reasons why this can happen but uh I want to break things down a little bit more uh granular first so first things first let me illustrate this and how I came across it and how we made this Discovery at my agency with a bit of a story so back in middle of 2023 uh middle of middle of last year when the AI automation agency boom was going crazy I just started talking about it a few months earlier and suddenly everyone was talking about it and it was the hottest thing in online business at the time um and there's so much tension I can probably draw the the graph from the last video If you guys remember that um but the Google trends for AI automation agency had this massive Spike and then it sort of flattened out to where we kind of are now but at this point morning side in my agency we were getting about 20 20 leads per day inbound leads per day via our contact form on our website so we had so much attention and so many people who wanted to work with us um that our sales process and our sales pip plan really started to get choked up and it really pointed out the the main issue that we were facing which is a low close rate despite all of that attention right so we were getting these 20 leads 20 leads per day LPD but when you looked at our actual close rate and the amount of people we and businesses we were converting into paying clients like 20 per day that might result in like one client and now that's a shocking that's a shocking close rate and uh we we realized that pretty quickly we said well this is a really terrible conversion rate for the amount of attention we're getting um but we realized that we were doing a few things wrong in our in our sales process and there was a few things that we tested and and played around with to try to fix that and what I'm about to break down is is the one that we settled on so the the sales process that we had at the time was an email would come in from our uh our contact form submission so the email come in it would have information like um name um budget description of the project and then on that alone my business partner Josh would go in and just evaluate some of those emails and go yes no yes no delete them if they're not interested interesting for us um but then if there were kind of a good Prospect a good lead we would then send them a discovery call link so then that book oh can I do it oh and that book and a discovery call with us and then we'd have a 30 minute Discovery call with them 30 minutes and then from there me I was going to you realize how complex this thing was at the time um and from there then we' need to go to my my CTO Spencer he would have been on most of those Discovery calls and then he would need to analyze how we can how we can build that project right so he needs to go and and do a full analysis of okay this is what the client this is what the lead wants this is how we're going to approach it this this is the the opening stage of the project this is the middle this is the end this is the amount of hours that are going to be for each of them and then we can go back to them um we can do sort of a a calculator here let's do a bit of a calculator we needed to calculate how many hours it was going to take to do that and then we'd create a full proposal I'm changing colors here then we need to do a full Proposal with like all of the the js on it which is okay this is the this is how much this stage of the project is going to cost this is the scope this is the cost Etc this would take I don't know like three 3 plus hours I'm running out a pen here but this whole process here of getting on Discovery call 30 minutes taking that going to Spen and say hey fener can you come up with can you figure out how we'd approach this build um and determine if if how many hours it's going to take then that information would need to go to my business partner Josh and he'd create this from a template albeit but then he'd have to create a proposal saying this is how we're going to do it this is how much it cost and then we need to book in another call I'm getting pretty good at draun these phones now need to book in another call and that's going to be a proposal call where it might be 30 men to 1 hour and now look at all this time we're taking just to get uh get to the point of proposal then on that call they'll either say sort of yes or no or make a verbal agreement and if at the end of the call they say yeah yeah sure it sounds good we found that it was a massive drop off between the people who we actually pres presented proposals to and the number of people who actually ended up signing and and paying us an invoice right so this drop off between proposal and and actually uh how can I draw this make this a we skip a couple steps in here like sending the contract going back and forth on the contract you would go back and forth and back and forth um flopping around and then by the time you gone back and forth with a contract three or four times then they're like suddenly not as interested in the in the project anymore they've lost the buzz uh you really need to get as quickly from this point of saying hey I'm interested I want to work with you and and getting them signed as fast as possible because in here Anything Could Happen they could something in their business could blow up Suddenly they're not interested in AI anymore they read an article and they're scared of it all sorts of crap so the longer this was the the higher the drop off we saw here but really the key drop off point was this proposal here cuz they go from someone who's filled out a form don't have really any idea how much this is going to cost them we go through all this time and we invest all this time here and calculating calling writing the proposal then we get on the call and present it and a lot of the times like this stuff a stuff isn't cheap if you have a development team like me and our developers cost quite a lot of money per hour we have to mark our services up significantly it's it's like very expensive projects a lot of the time and when you then present that to them they are are nowhere near ready for that kind of price point well in in most cases so it's really an issue of lead quality and we weren't checking or or sort of price testing them beforehand and we're wasting all this time in getting to this point at the end where we've we've pitched them and then they look at it and they go oh W like I'm no chance no chance I'm paying that and they go that's way too expensive for what I'm looking for thank you have a nice day and so we got this big drop off where you might get I don't know you make six proposals and get like one of these guys coming out the other end and they're actually interested in signing for the for the project so looking at this we realized we are spending so much time on this step here of hopp hopping on calls with basically everyone and then allowing these Tire kickers let me draw a tire tire kickers are all over the AI space they business owners who are interested these early adopters if you remember the tech adoption curve were in this early adopter phase watch that video which I'll put up here if you haven't already this is a very important concept to understand we are getting a lot of early adopters especially earlier on in my journey last year in the first sort of six months of starting my agency we were getting a lot of these early adopters who didn't really care much about the the functionality of it they just wanted to feel like they're building something cool and and being on the front foot with their business so these guys do tend to be tie kickers they because they aren't seeking some really really business changing implementation the the rate of them being TI kickers and just kind of wanting to to hop on calls and learn more and feel like they're in the space is uh is much higher so tie kickers they're just coming in and we're spending all of this time 30 minutes and then Spencer is having to do uh I don't know maybe like one to two hours here and then Josh has to put 3 hours in here and then we have to put Spencer and Josh on this call for a 30 minute to an hour call so much time just to find out are they or are they not a tie kicker and so what we did to change this is I mean it it was kind of like a Hail Mary we were just saying look these close rates are so awful there has something has to change so let's just like it let's just let's just throw a low ticket offer at them to get them started and and see who gets through so what we did is implemented what we now call an exploration Milestone and this this may be standard for uh development companies all over the show but um until about a year ago I wasn't some development company Company CEO as many of you guys won't be so we were definitely learning this as as people have just been online business entrepreneurs and having to pick up how to run these development companies um there's there's Nuance to to the the sales process as you can imagine so we tried this thing we'll call it an exploration Milestone and if I rewrite this this flow uh the email still came in uh we still approved or disproved it and then disapproved it declined uh and if it was good we we probably have a thing here where it's like eh we don't want to work with them we book in the discovery call and that's going to still be 30 minutes but then at the end of the discovery call if we've qualified them and vetted them out properly and they they seem like a good client there's a like when we get we get so many leads coming to us that we can be quite picky about who we work with because there's nothing worse than I mean I built my business to have a an income stream but also to enjoy what I do and if I'm dealing with clients who are at Absolute pain in the ass that is working against what my goal was with my business right I I don't want this to feel like a trap and my business partner in the whole team don't want to work with awful people it's so bad it's it's like multiple levels of of of of Badness that there's multiple levels of of Destruction and damage within the business because not only you are dealing with this this bad client but everyone in the team is it just brings it's like an anchor that that brings down the whole team um so we get very picky here um and at the end of the discovery call if they have a clear solution that we can solve if they are someone who we want to work with and overall seems like a good potential client for us then we will at the end of the call we will transition it transition it that's a transition to at the end of the call I'll go to my business partner Josh so hey Josh yeah everything checks out for me here I think it's good for us to just jump straight into an exploration Milestone uh and kick things off next week boom now we've gone from just talking about hey AI stuff is cool yeah tie kick of this tie kick of that we're starting to put the heat on them and say say hey look we're looking we need some money like you've got your free Discovery call we've had a chat with you and now you got to cough up to keep working with us now this does come down to some degree to the brand that that you've built for me and morning side we have a a considerable brand position as a AI Solutions company because of the stuff that I do here wav my hands around on the camera because it shows that I know what I'm talking about right and you want to work with people who know what they're talking about which is why you should consider making content either YouTube LinkedIn whatever it is I can't even explain I mean we're getting 20 of these a day we still get quite a lot of them and I don't even post nearly as much as I did back in the day so getting a little bit off track but then we say explow exploration Milestone that's what we're looking to do we end the call and straight after the call well we get them to agree to it and we say yeah well if if you're happy we can we can start what we call an exploration Milestone they might ask question say well that's when we just uh go in and we do a very quick sort of prototyping scoping specking determining how much this is going to cost for you we can't give you an accurate quote on the whole project until we've gone in and done some exploration and done some tests because we need to actually cuz the clients will want certain kinds of outputs from the system and because we're going to get into this in a second which is a really cool part of this video so stick around um but clients want specific outputs from their systems as as anyone would and if we aren't able to get those kind of outputs then we shouldn't take on the project right so exploration is kind of saving your ass and also making sure the client and expectations are managed correctly because you get a chance to go okay let's very quickly spread up a prototype for okay pass me your data Mr client and let me give me some examples of input and output peers and and responses that you want from it okay I'm going to take those in give my to my D team and they can who it up quickly sort of determine if we can get kind of close to the outputs they're looking for if we can great yep that system works to some degree now we're good to take on the full project and we can be confident that we can charge you x amount of dollars and it's going to come within this time frame so it's really such a key thing and mass like an absolute game changer for our business um so how do we go from here exploration milestone we send that via email so we'll send a templated contract we'll send an email just saying hey just following up on uh on on the C which is had um the exploration Milestone is going to cost x amount and we started off with ours at uhu $800 and that would be sort of a 3 to 5 day exploration and I usually more it usually ended up sort of closer to five than three um but the $800 exploration was a good price point that we found people would be interested in and and they took the bait they took the offer pretty often so right here you're asking them to cough up and you're saying sorry buddy no more Tire kickers Beyond here you are not going to get a single second more of my time until you've given me money to compensate me and my team which allowed us to then only make presentations to clients who are actually qualified to some degree financially qualified um so I bring in the price uh the time that they had to cough up some money from way down here to up here we just saved ourselves all this time and that that was a absolute game changer for us our business partner Josh instead of working on a being on the sales call hamster wheel and proposals we' go through these cycles of oh yeah cool this is Big C in the pipel and then next week yeah they didn't reply to the proposal so it happens to it happens to me it'll happen to you but you can do things with your sales process to try to split split the W the wheat from the chaff a little bit sooner so you want the you want the good guys to make it past year you want to give them a chance to show that they are serious and this this amount is a is a good way of doing it now for full transparency we now charge most recent one we did was $2,000 um we've actually charged right up to $5,000 now that may sound ludicrous but when we do $100,000 deals a $5,000 exploration uh in order to scope it all out there's a lot of work invol for us but the client would rather pay 5 grand up front and determine hey is this feasible uh what kind of what's the actual budget going to be at the end of the day and and are these kind of systems actually something that are a good match for my use case so you can charge up to $2,000 $5,000 for these Explorations it take these these take sort of 2 to 3 weeks so uh just being fully transparent so it's not like it was a 3day and 3day these are definitely big boys for bigger projects and then exploration Milestone you send that off bya email say Hey look it's going to cost2 Grand or in your case might be $800 to start it's going to cost $800 let me know if that's all good and I can send over my we can send over a templated contract you just change a couple little things uh and once I've signed that you send the send the invoice with the contract as well once it's all paid then you go sweep straight into slack and then you go hey send requirements and that's when you ask them okay in order to do our our exploration actually I missed the best part of this whole thing let me go back a step this is when it gets real Saucy so not only does this exploration give us a chance to weed out the the guys from uh the split the wheat from the CHF we also get an opportunity to set expectations with our clients and AI systems are inherently random and hard to predict they are non-deterministic by nature which means that the same input can create different outputs and this is due to the sort of randomization of the next token generation we are trying to give in in many cases reliable and predictable outcomes with technology that on the most fun most fundamental like foundational level is random and and tries to be random so in order to solve in order to get client satisfaction and set expectations right we have also had to deal with let me let me give you an example actually this is a bit way to do it this may sound familiar so client uh client uh say You're Building some kind of chatbase system for them client uh doesn't like output say that you're building a system a chat bot for them and they say oh I I don't like the way that it says that and you say okay well they provide ideal output and you go okay well I'll I'll tune the system to try get it to outut output that kind of output and then it outputs the correct one maybe four out of five times client gets mad because it's not always consistent now this this four out of five times the other time the one out of five times that it doesn't say it it might just slightly reward it but this client is looking for exact outputs and you're trying to he wants exact outputs for you to get the money from them and finish the contract you need to give them this five out of five perfect exact same outputs every time when in reality the system is putting out one and five times something that is a slight modification of it's still saying the same thing it still means the same but it's a slightly different wording and this client goes eh client gets mad because it's not consistent um demands refund because I don't like like the way it talks so here you have a feeling I don't like the the way that the client feels about the outputs is now determining whether or not you get your money which is a a bad place to be so we have tried to solve this problem in a number of ways and eventually in combination with the exploration Milestone we came up with a method that solves all of this while also allowing us to De exploration and solving Downstream issues with client satisfaction as well so I'll now get into that cuz I know you came for the source but I'll uh I'll give you double serving cuz you know that's how we work on this channel so the issue here is as I just pointed out llms are you're dealing with two problems one llms llm uh non deterministic they are by Nature random and they they split out different outputs from the same inputs and then two you're also fighting against client feelings and subjective opinions now these two when you're trying to build a business selling AI Solutions these two go together like Mentos and Coca-Cola um they don't they don't get along uh and this is a an awful mixture of things to build a business on and we at morning side realize this pretty quick that okay well clients are going to have feelings towards if we're building any kind of chat based or or even just it's it's a Content generator how they feel about like h i don't it's not really what I like there's something about this and some sometimes would get to a point where a client is yeah this system's cool yeah yeah it's good it's good it's good it's good good and then the next week they'll say oh no we need a big change I I just suddenly don't like this anymore and you're dealing with emotions uh emotions and opinions and you're trying to make money and have some kind of consistent and predictable business uh but you're also now now at at the at the whm of these client emotions and also these inherently random systems so these two problems we realize pretty quick that if we don't solve these at morning side we're going to be we're going to be in the and we're not going to have much of a business so how did we solve this well my uh my absolute wiiz and Genius of a CTO uh we sort of tasked them with this and said hey we need a solution to this and he came up with a now widely used system um can I rub this off no I still I still have a bit more to go uh that we call it's not we didn't it's been a thing but the way that we apply it I believe is a sort of a industry first it's called coign similarity similarity so what cosine similarity does is it's a test that we can run that allows us to determine the similarity this the semantic similarity of two sets or or any number of set of of uh actually I believe it is just for two uh the the the similarity of two pieces of text so whether that's a word just apples and oranges whether that's phrases whether that's whole bodies of paragraphs whether it's a whole book uh you can use coine similarity to get a a t tangible metric is really the key thing here a tangible metric that you can point to and say yes these two things are similar and for us with these exploration milestones we started integrating coine similarity testing as part of the exploration Milestone determine if we can get the the the right mathematically most similar types of answers that are going to be satisfactory to the client so we can kind of make sure that we know what we're doing ahead of time and be like yep we can get a we can get pretty close to this uh but more importantly it gives us a a metric that we can use in our contracts to to stop that subjectivity and oh I like the I like it but like it could say this and this or hey it's giving me the same answer four times but there's one that's different it's like well mate at the end of the day our contract says it's the semantic meaning of it and the similarity of the text if there's if it's one word changed this thing protects us so let me let me break down how this works so coine similarity uh this is going to get a little bit technical but I do quite like uh getting in this and it's important for you guys to know this to some degree so Cent similarity this is going to really challenge my uh my art skills or um down okay so that's a three-dimensional space and we're going to have so it's kind of going backwards by the way it's not facing us so we have one point over here we have another point over here and we have another point uh up over here and so what these are is coordinates in a multi-dimensional space in this case we'll just do three dimensions so that it's easy to understand but in reality this is happening in in I think 8,000 what was it 8,000 Dimensions it's impossible for the human brain to comprehend but uh this will this this will suffice um so we have this 3D space we have .1 2.3 and what coine similarity allows us to do is determine the similarity of these three points so this might be a word of of beans this might be P's and this might be car and so what the co similarity test does is that if we go to our client in this exploration phase or in the the actual contract we will ask them for hey can you give me uh 5 to 10 examples of inputs and outputs that you would like out of the system and when they give us the inputs and output we then have something to grade our AI outputs of the system against so say they have a chat bot and it needs to be outputting a certain type of answer we can run their 11 inputs against our system so we have our system here we take the 10 inputs we run them each through our system and it outputs 1 2 3 Etc and then we have the original 10 inputs and the well this is the system that they used to create which is their own brain of okay what what should this thing be answering so this is a human this is an AI and then it's going to Output the well it's not really outputting the brain has outputed it but we have 10 and 10 and the 10 that we create from our system we can then use coine similarity to get the average or we can we can compare the similarity of this one to this one and determine if yes our AI system is creating outputs that are similar enough to this we add Aver is M and then we can get an overall similarity score so coming back to the graph here so we have this one here which is is one input might be uh how do I change my password and then this one will be the AI output one and this one will be the human one they might say in order to change your password you need to go to XYZ website and then based off the AI system that we built it might say in order to change your password please navigate to the S so they are fairly similar and then when we run them through the coine similarity test it's conver ing these words and it runs it through an embedding model and the words get converted to a a set of coordinates that might be like 0.1 0.5 all 0.9 uh and it goes on and on and on and on and on but in this case we've just got three coordinates because we've got a threedimensional graph so what the cosine system does is it converts words into their numerical equivalence within a vector space and by having these coordinates it can plot them in the vector Space by their similarity so in this case you see beans and peas are are close that's because the embedding model that we use and run the beans through it's going to give out a coordinate and then we run P's through it it's going to go H okay that fits there and they end up being close to each other within the vector space and so how does what does coine similar similarity actually mean well it's the measurement of the angle between these two bad boys here so the smaller the angle the more similar they are the larger the angle see if we go from P's to car or from Beans to car the angle here is much larger oh I'm getting back into my my uh what was that calculous in trigonometry and whatnot um but yeah beans the car is a much larger angle therefore the coign similarity is going to be lower than B's 2 PS that makes sense so this is taking the subjective opinions and emotions of people who go oh but I like the outputs I don't really like the outputs I don't care you have told us these in the in the exploration Milestone we won't necessarily hold them to that in the contract of the exploration Milestone it would just be hey look give us some outputs and uh we'll compare them to it and internally we can check and use that in the end of the report so at the end of the exploration Milestone you'll give them a report and a proposal which we'll go into in a second but the numbers that we get back from our testing if we we say okay look by the way cosine similarity goes from0 to 1 um so high a good range uh we go for in our expirations we might be looking for 0.85 or or uh or higher but for our final builds we'll be going for anywhere from 0.9 to 0.95 in most cases so that means it's it's highly similar and when we do our expiration Milestone we'll be looking to see if we can get this sort of number and say okay give me those 10 out 10 outputs and 10 inputs we're going to run it through the system see what we get okay yep we're around 8. 0.85 or higher we're confident that we can build the system for you so it's as much of client satisfaction as it is for our sanity we don't want to be taken on trying to take down a mammoth with a slingshot you know like we need to be taking on clients that we know that we can deliver for because I tell you what These Guys these these early adopters have huge expectations um it's actually it's more the people who are the sort of early majority who have the bigger expectations cuz they like oh well I've heard all the stuff about AI let me give it a try and they expect that to just completely change your business so you need to make sure that they're not expecting too much and given the data and the kind of inputs and outputs they have provided we are able to get close enough to it that we can feel confident in going for a a complete contract a full contract on it so that's C on similarity you can convert the 10 inputs or five to 10 inputs that the client gives you into uh or the output sorry into a set of coordinates or or numbers that a computer can understand and when we convert these over we can plot them um automatically we have a tool for this that we give to our accelerator members so that they can do this testing um for their clients we have an internal one as well that we use at morning side and you just run these run these outputs through the co similarity system it's going to determine the similarity of them and then we'll average it out and say okay what was the average number so that's cosine similarity might sound a bit complex but we are dealing with complex issues and complex technology so uh and complex emotions of clients too H and so how does this tie back into the exploration system and how it changed our our sales process and sort of revolutionize our business and how can how can you you use it too really so now they've paid us we've done the exploration Milestone and the uh we then need to present the the findings to them so once you've done all this work and you've you've created your uh you've given this to your divs they've gone and that's a that's a that's a the coding symbol uh they've gone and done the work they've done the exploration we've got the cosine coine similarity scores out pretty confident we've done enough of the exploration that we can get to the point where we're confident in pitching uh for the full project now uh this comes out and we now have a proposal that we put together which is let's just go half and half here the first half is going to be the findings the findings of the exploration which is hey look we did these tests and these are the kind of outputs we're really happy with this we're kind of concerned about this so this first half is the findings and then in the second half you're then going to be pitching your proposal and in this proposal we need to have that's when you get your your developer either you do it yourself or or the the lead developer on your team then you need to get them to create that proposal which is what Spencer was doing earlier in the in the older system which is okay what are the sections how many hours three four Etc how many hours is each of these things going to take and that's going to determine how we can price it within this proposal so you just we typically just mark up we get the our estimates from our CTO Spencer and then we just mark up based off our kind of inflating markup rate that we apply to our our services um so whether that's a few hundred now whether that's you're get to thousands of dollars uh you can just kind of Mark that up and and apply that overall and that proposal you will also include gosh makes me realize how much how much there is to cover in this stuff uh I thought this was going to be a quick video but inside the proposal then you have the cosine similarity score that you agree on so this will become part of the contract and that is what's going to save you from the subjective opinions of clients who are unhappy with h i don't really like how it sounds that kind of rubbish first half the findings of the discovery and here as we get to there's so much for me to talk about on this I probably can't squeeze all into this video but there's a number of different factors as to why this works and why it's so important uh one of them is that you get a chance to build trust you get to show them how you operate and this right here is the most important part because they've just paid you $800 it's basically like a like they're just sort of having a dig and saying look these guys seem professional let's see if they really know this stuff and they've given you a small amount of money and you've gone a way that should pay your developers and hopefully give you a bit of extra so youve again you're getting cash flow here which is great even if you don't end up taking the project on you can just get paid to do Explorations for these people which cash flow early on in your agency that that kept us alive I sh you not but then you come down here and you get a chance to show them who you are show them how you operate show them your level of professionalism and the findings and the way that you do this presentation is going to be key so this is actually done on a call oh let me see if I can get this again this is done on on what we call our proposal call so we'll get them on a call 30 minutes to half an hour we'll go through the findings of it very professional hey this is what we did we're concerned about this this is the kind outcomes we've got um this are the co similarity scores and we you can kind of introduce this as the concept on these Calles we can say hey look given the the inputs and outputs that you gave us we were able to get to a 0.85 similarity which means that it's very good um and and with a bit more bit more funding and a bit more effort we can get this to a point where it's it's far more similar it's up sort of the 0.9 0.95 range um so you get to give them the findings and then you give them the proposal based off the estimations that your your lead developer or yourself have come up with and that goes in the second half which is a proposal breaking down each of the parts of the full build and how much that's going to cost them on the call you need to have the contract ready and in the contract um if they're all good to go and there's no complaints then you send them over the contract get it signed on the call if possible because as soon as that call ends your chance of closing them just just goes through the floor um try to get them to to sign that contract on the call because as soon as they signed it doesn't matter about the invoice really if they've signed that they've made a a commitment to paying that invoice as well so as long as you can get it signed walk into the contract handle objections whatever you need to do point out that the cosine similarity metric is in there and say hey look because these are kind of subjective output uh this is something that we do to both Safeguard ourselves and to make sure that you are protected and that we have a level of of standard uh a bar to work towards and the quality of outputs that this system generates so having this C similarity pitch it as a benefit for you and them which it is and say hey look this is the this is the agreed one we're going to be aiming for 0.9 anything more than that might be overfitting CU you can make the system too good at giving certain answers um you want to keep it around that 0.9 to 0.95 range um and that's what we'll put in our contract and that is the way that we can stop this if you've ever done these kind of projects before where it's Custom Custom builds uh you'll know that it can just kind of go on and on and on and it's like review revision hell we call it review hell and it just goes on and on and on and it's so painful when you have a chatbot system that you've created and then you send it off to them and they send back like a 30 40 minute Loom and you just especially when it's a low ticket client as well if you've been paid three or $4,000 and you're sitting there on your Saturday afternoon going through this guy's revision notes and then having it go back and fix the system up and man it is not pretty and it's not the kind of lifestyle that I want for my business and so we are try to avoid as much of this crap as possible by saying no we have the coign similarity this thing is performing as expected we're done send me the money send me the money so yeah hope I uh got all that across but the exploration Milestone has been a complete game changer for us and if you want to incorporate something similar into your business while well you may not do the exact same thing as a as an AI agency owner what you do need to think about is this line and how do I spend less time talking to tie kickers who are going to waste my time and how can I push quickly to start filtering out cuz you guys may do some Mund Le generation you may do a LinkedIn whatever and you may be having conversations but you'll pretty quickly realize that a lot of these are just conversations and you need to start finding the the guys with money to spend these are the guys you want to be talking to and the longer you give them like there's billions of people on the Earth and don't assume that all of them are like you and I and now rational and and don't want to waste time some of them are deluded some of them have mental issues and they will happily sit on these calls and waste your time and that's not going to help your business you're going to end up spending so much time talking to people are never going to be clients while it may be good sales practice if you need that but talking to a looney is maybe not the best kind of sales practice you you should be after but yeah take this concept whether you apply it bar for bar or whether you just take the kind of distill it down and say hey look I need to put some kind of filter earlier on whether that's uh it's early on in my when I was doing calls for my Consulting calls on my channel I would have a $300 or $500 Consulting call and that those are the people that would then take on as Dev clients so if they came through Consulting calls they've already kind of pre-qualified or pre-selected themselves saying hey look I'm willing to spend $500 on this so that was kind of our earlier exploration Milestone but we started getting leads directly through our website not just through my uh through my channel and through the through the Consulting call link so yeah take it apply it and this is particularly good for for General agencies like myself who are doing custom Solutions every time if you are a niche agency um and you have the same thing to sell every single time may be a little bit different but I think this is Handy to have in your back pocket either way and it will help you get past $10,000 a month which was a a major issue that we had and the rest is history so hope this been helpful guys um I certainly enjoyed making it and yeah exploration milestones and Co similarity I hope you got it all uh and I will see you in the next one keep going uh you can do it this opportunity is not going anywhere but you need to make back you need to make moves on it now um if you want to get there so I'm rooting for you and keep going ciao"

              "text": "hey guys leam Watley here and today I have a video that may piss off some people in my community um and that's because I'm going to be kind of exposing why now is the best time to get into starting one of these AI agencies and it's going to of course lead to more competition but I think on the whole it's going to benefit the space because right now is by far the best time that I've ever seen and the 12 months that I've been in the space to get in and start one of these things and if I was starting again I would wish to start with this kind of stuff that we have on hand now which I'm going to break down in this video it's kind of three key factors that are really highlighting this this kind of timing in the market to me right now um and I'm going to break this down in this video for you all so that if you're someone who's interested in starting an AI agency and have kind of been on the fence this should kick you well well off the fence and into the into the into our side of the yard um if you've started one before and you've kind of failed or had issues this is going to be the content of this video is going to show you that now is the best time to start again because we have new tools on hand and it's going to make it a lot easier for you and if you're completely new to the space and you're not sure okay do I want to start an online business what kind of thing do I need to start what skills do I need this will also give you a a very clear picture of what the state of the AI agency business model is and you can use that to to base your decision on whether or not you should jump into it so um so much cool stuff to get through in this video um stick with me because I've been really planning this together for for a while to put together for you all so um I can rub this off now and um I can outline the uh the three key areas that are pointing towards this being the best possible time time and really the the determining factors for me and why I'm I'm so eager to make this video for you all Tech so these are the factors that are making now the best time to start and they've been changing for the past while but now that's kind of all lining up the stars are riging and if you're looking to get into it now then now is the best time to do it so firstly we have technology two we have market dynamics and three we have marketing methods so I'm going to be breaking down each of these now might take a while but it will be worthwh so to start things off we're going to be going over technology first which is a big segment to cover so as AI agencies we build on top of the technology of other people we don't we try not to build it all ourselves from the ground up if you've tried to it's like you're not building your own language models right you're building on top of open ai's language models and you building on top of maybe low code no code software like voice flow but in terms of the technology we used to deliver in order to make it easier for us and more cost effective for our customers we need to build on top of what's available because that means that these companies are doing the hard work and we are doing less of it we are really just the the the Puppet Masters on top of it sort of controlling the play of what's happening on their platform at the time of filming this video we have seen some massive jumps and technology that are making it far easier for us as AI agency owners to build powerful Solutions so uh the way I like to illustrate this is say we have a before and after so when I started my agency back in uh 20 early 2023 early 2023 and now we have over here um April 24 very different sets of Technologies were available to us um and the way you can illustrate this is with what I like to do a little a pyramid kind of diagram here but say we're trying to build Solutions businesses and we are relying on these platforms as I mentioned to give us the the tools so that we can build on top of them and build something valuable for our clients now in early 2023 when we just had the open AI chat GPT API we didn't even have it at the start of the year I remember when I was I was building my Solutions trying to make these custom knowledge chat gbts using a raw language model that wasn't even conversation optimized like you wouldn't even believe just how bad that was and we were trying to force these things to do things that they weren't really built to do but in the past year we have seen massive leaps in like absolutely massive leaps in technology from what we I was trying to build things with last year and the way this can be Illustrated on these bricks is back in early 2023 all I had was this so this brick here we'll call this the language model I had a open AI language model but I had to build everything else around it say this was uh this was a vector store Vector store this was chat history this was a a custom tooling so in this case for me to just get to the point where I could create some kind of useful solution for my customer or for my client I had to build everything else myself I got the language model and the API from open AI sure but I had to build everything else myself we were building our own Vector stores for a knowledge base we were having a weaving our own chat history management so that they could understand what was happening before it was really ugly and really messy but what we have now is a completely different setup where open AI I'm just using open AI as an example I can go into some other in a second but instead of just having the language model we also have open AI with the assistant API V2 which is just released they have the state-ofthe-art best-in-class knowledge base in Vector store so the knowledge is handled by openai now then we have the chat history which is managed by the assistant API I don't have to do that crap anymore okay we have custom tooling they allow me to plug those into my into my assistance automatically they have thread management and all these everything is now done for me all I need to do is come on here and maybe add the the icing on the cake and just tell it what to do and really just put my spin on it and I'm creating all the same level of value maybe even more as I used to back here but I can create this in an afternoon give it like 4 hours I can create a text based agent on the assistance API that is as good as it would have taken a custom like development team and and my team back in back in I guess early 2023 as well would have taken us all this time to build these components ourselves and to get to this level of value now I can stroll in there myself and I can whip together the equivalent of that in in a couple hours so this technology trend of of being easy and easy for us as AI agencies to build on top of is really the first point that I want to point out to you today and that you get to benefit from all the hard work of these companies of building these platforms for you and now you may be wondering yes okay but the easier it gets then the easier it is for businesses to do it themselves trust me these guys are not still not going to do this there's still enough complexity here and you need to understand how these AI systems work so that this box here is always going to be needed there may be some solutions that really boil things down to hey just drop your things in here and plug it onto the site but there's still going to be the majority of the market needing the special the Specialists like us as people who understand what AI can do for businesses so this box here is really where we can focus on providing our value which is the customization of all of this stuff like the vector stores the chat history the custom tooling we just need to add our little spin on top of it which is great news for you all because you don't have to have the team and the skills to build all of these like we used to have to last year this is just one example um another thing I kind of want to point these out one um you may be wondering why we have this guy here I'll explain a little bit later one we have the assistance api2 and that is for text based agents so if you want to build a custom knowledge chat GPT or a custom version of chat GPT we have the assistance API V2 which just launched recently and that's really the main thing that's triggered this video for me because me and my team at morning side and we've built our own software agentive and it was built on top of the assistant API because we knew that these Tech based agents were going to be huge but it was far too slow it's far too expensive and this big update that we've gotten covers even more of these bases for us it makes it cheaper makes it faster and now we have a really powerful platform that like best in the world in terms of the knowledge base as well there have such a powerful platform to build on top of you just have to W in there and learn the basics of it I've done videos on the channel before and how you can build uh build assistance and build agents on top of this platform but secondly we have the voice AI coming of age as well um and Bland I think is the guys who are are leading the space there Bland AI so Bland AI has just released what they call conversational Pathways and so if you're looking they've done the same thing here where prior you used to have to really jury rig all this extra stuff and and make make custom web perks and custom tools and and really had a hard time to create the kind of basic solutions that we're looking for we seeing Leaps and Bounds on both the text based agents side and the voice-based agent side via Bland AI there's other companies that are doing it as well but I I personally like what Bland's doing with the conversational Pathways and what I'm trying to say here is that we it's never been easier to build powerful things the depth and the Precision at which you can build these voice agents now you can build AI reception for people you can build outbound calling agents that are going to qualify and and sort of book like book in calls or even try to close deals over the phone we are in the perfect time right now a convergence of all of these factors and new technologies where you have the the best options ever of building ridiculously powerful custom chat gpts on the Assistance api2 or you can build ridiculously powerful and complex Voice assistance on uh Bland Ai and other other softwares like that and it's it's because they also have the depth that you need too you need I always talk about this on the channel you need to pick platforms that have enough depth where you can become an expert over time because if you're going to be focusing on a platform you don't want to pick one of these chatbot builders that is super basic and you're only going to be able to get to a certain level before you're capped by the platform itself these things here the reason I'm talking about them today is because they have enough depth and I would highly recommend you looking into okay I'm starting my AI agency I don't know where to start okay well just pick voice just start here and say I'm going to get really deep into Bland Ai and see how how much cool stuff I can build because I'm telling you I've been going through the the conversational Pathways um option that they have now we're building things within my own agency more side AI as well and this conversational pathways are so they give so much depth for you to build really complex Solutions there's no chance any business owner is going to try jump in there build it themselves so you can Master this or you can Master this just pick one area and do it well okay now and number two we have the market conditions and market dynamics of the the AI agency space right now so let me rub this stuff off number two we have market dynamics now this goes back to that graph that I had up before which was this one here now this is actually something that I've got off Google Trends so now I I did have this uptick on it but this is kind of a looking ahead a bit let's say this is now so this is the graph if you pull up Google trans and you search up AI agency or AI automation agency this was uh as I mentioned before kind of mid 23 when it first started ticking off I started making my videos in about May um about what we're doing at morning side and then it kind of exploded into June and July so I continued to put out more videos and other people hopped on it too uh but it shot up to here and we've seen it kind of fall off uh the attention the interest on the model has come down and down and down and down now it's kind of in this holding pattern uh where it's flattening off you guys can go search this up for yourself um but it is kind of flattening off here so you may be thinking well if it's the attention is falling off and no one's no one's talking about the thinging anymore like I be I get these guys in my comments like or or adding me on Twitter like H this thing was cool and it was really big and popular and now it's it's like that that is the the these are the people that are falling off it's the people who have seen this thing they got hyped into it and all these other people making videos on it as well and now they think they're smarty because they've got out of it and they're moving on to another thing these people are just constantly moving into from business model to business model and what this represents is not a decrease in the it's not a fall off in the opportunity itself it's a it's a decrease in the attention on it by people who are looking to make a quick buck and so what we've had here is the exiting of thousands and thousands of people who used to watch my videos who gave it a go they weren't good enough they they tried it and the technology wasn't good enough so it was hard for them to succeed so of course it's going to fall off there's going to be a big drop off from people from the peak down to where we are now but you must keep in mind that the attention on this is not the attention and demand for AI Services which is what we're trying to sell it's a decrease in the attention of the people who are trying to start the business model so that that that completely different things and so the demand for AI Services you could probably I mean I'm I don't have data on this but I'd say the demand for AI Services is going like this so the need for and this goes back to the technology adoption curve remember remember my my recent video we have the technology adoption curve I'm going to link that boom boom boom up here somewhere if you haven't watched it yet but it's important you understand this technology adoption curve because while we have all these people getting in and going like oh waa whoa AI business yeah yeah what Liam saying sounds good oh this is hard never mind I'm going to go try to do something else and I this there's a new business model coming out every week and I guess I'm hard of the problem there um but people are jumping into things like growth operating I don't even know what the a growth operator is or does or means but we have people who are just like like like people who are just constantly dating new people like they you know they they go on a date with one person they go eh don't really like them nck eh don't really like that nck they're just going round and round and round and round and round and really if they just sat and had three dates with one person they're more likely to find something that they actually like and and have a longer term partnership with it now that's not me speaking from personal experience or anything but the dating analogy is pretty good because people like to date and try all these different business business models and what I'm asking you to do is see that the technology adoption curve is is in our favor more people are more business owners are opening up the thought of AI Solutions in their business so we're seeing hypothetically and theoretically we should be seeing more and more demand for AI Services as more of this Market opens up but at the same time we're having more and more people who are falling out of the business model and thinking that it's not the vehicle to to be in because it was too hard because they see other more shiny things and what you need to do is fight against this or use this as use this to your advantage and say wow like I have the lowest competition for this opportunity ever since since before we started which you couldn't have started anyway now you have less competitors more Focus less noise and you also have remember number one better technology far better technology than there was up here so not only do you have less competition you have the best technology we've ever had to build these Solutions it's easier because you're building on top of what the other companies have built for us so that right here where I think we are right now is the best time to get into it because it's technology and the fall off of the competition so hope that hope that makes sense um but these graphs typically look like h no one's interested in this anymore but at the end of the day the opportunity that we built this whole model on and the reason I got into it and the reason many of you probably started listening to me in the first place was because the the opportunity made sense AI Solutions are going to be needed for businesses to adopt the technology that hasn't changed at all all that changed is the attention that's on it so you need to like the opportunity still is the same if anything it's getting better and and more lucrative over time as more of these businesses unlock in this in this technology adoption curve graph and become receptive to putting AI into their business so that's step two market dynamics and that's the second reason when I saw this Google Trend graph I was like this is this is exactly what I need to show people to get them to realize that this is the best time we have this overlay of demand but also people who are getting out of it it's it's like the it's like the old crypto analogy where like the build is build and the bare Market this is our be Market we have been slogging through trying to build these AI solutions to businesses and it has been hell for many of us because the technology wasn't there because the demand wasn't there because there's not enough people but we're starting to see more and more businesses be receptive to it we're seeing more and more people within my community succeed so many people now I think there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who are just in my school Community alone who have noted themselves down as consistently signing their clients I'll put the the data up on screen if I can get a screenshot of it but we get a data of people who trying to join my school and they tell us whether they are just starting out whether they have just signed their first client or whether or not they are consistently signing clients and there are now hundreds of people who are in that final category so while there are people dropping out there's also a lot of people who are succeeding um and and finally being able to sell this stuff because of the technology advances we're getting as well so man I love that one as can tell I love getting up to speed on these videos gets me fired up hope you guys are getting fired up too and finally we have oh I used the wrong color go uh we have marketing methods so when I mean marketing methods when I say marketing methods what I'm talking about is the ways in which you can market and sell your Solutions I know kind of self-explanatory but the reason I bring it up now is because up until recently I'd say in the last sort of two months the best method by which you could actually acquire AI agency customers and clients has been a a work in progress I'm being completely transparent and honest um we have been rapidly testing methods and angles and using the the power of my community and my accelerator my free community as well we have all these smart people working on trying to figure this out and it's it's I can I could never possibly do it on my own my agency mornings I relies on my YouTube we've never run any outbound we never run any ads we've gotten all of our I think we've got 1,500 leads over the past 12 months purely for my channel and we've never had to run anything else so for us it doesn't make sense for us to be going out and trying all these different other marketing methods because we get enough more than enough business from my channel Alone um but that's where the people in my community come in handy because they don't all have channels so they've been trying all these different methods and myself and my team have been sort of collecting all of this data and determining okay what is working what is not and that's what I'm going to be sharing with you here and I'm so excited to be sharing with you this with you now because I'm really going to be putting the the keys in your hand to get this thing up and running finally because we've been get having to test so many different methods and I think a lot of the time we're taking from things like smma and applying it to applying it to our Market here and the smma based methods do not really work because we're in that technology adoption curve remember and there's very few people if you're doing cold email there's very few people who are actually receptive to getting AI in their business I'm getting a little bit Lost In The Weeds here but marketing methods are coming of age is what I'm saying here and what what I mean by this is uh what we used to say is okay we want to be doing outbound and we're going to be sending say cold email and we're going to be getting in front of as many people as possible until they buy our AI stuff but more so recently we are seeing um success with inbound now this may seem so stupid because I've been I've been using inbound lead generation for my agency the entire time um and I probably should have just rolled that out as the original strategy but I thought man it's unrealistic for me to go and sit down to people who who join my community or or watch my videos and say you need to start a a YouTube channel to succeed because not everyone wants not everyone wants to start YouTube not everyone is comfortable on camera I certainly it might look like I am now but I I've just been standing here the whole morning trying to refilm this thing for you guys because I'm never happy with the the quality of which I'm speaking I'm stuttering of my voices literally exhibit a I just proved my point but we also have other oh can I do this we have other methods of inbound Le generation as well I think that's LinkedIn logo we also have things like LinkedIn and this is the one we've been seeing a lot of success with lately and if you watch my recent video you'll know that I'm pointing out this inbound lead generation method quite heavily um the reason this works is because if you're posting content and sharing about your Solutions and what you're learning just just mimic what I did on my channel scroll back and see over the past year what I've been doing I would learn something new I would make a video about it and people would come and be wow that's interesting hey could you do this and I was getting live real time feedback from the market on what I should be building and and what people were interested in you need to do the same thing within your Niche or wherever you're looking to start so the strategy we recommend to get started now is with this the maturation of the marketing method is to focus on unboundly generation first because you get a sort of three birds one stone effect where you get to progress much faster and I still get on calls with people in my community who are doing this wrong um and this is kind of why I'm trying to put it out on the biggest platform I have right now which is most people will start an agency and they will learn learn learn learn learn learn and try to come up with a solution and then they'll build build build build build and then they go okay here is when I'm going to start marketing I'm going to start marketing my solution here and theyve just wasted what not wasted but they spent 3 months maybe 2 to 3 months of learning and then building and then guessing they're guessing what the market wants here they've just gone oh Liam talked about this I'm just going to grab it and build it and try to sell it and then they start running cold email where they start trying to run ads they do all sorts of stuff when in that 3-month period I'm not sure if I'm running out of screen here um what you could have instead been doing is going okay I'm going to learn and post a video and then I'm going to learn and post a video or make a Linkin post post I'm going to learn and you just go boop boop boop see this iteration cycle of learning to thing here that's a 3-month cycle just to get one product out but here if you're constantly you can go okay I'm going to learn and then I'm going to post I'm going to learn and then all of a sudden you have people who are reaching out to you who are interested in what you're what you're building they go wow that was cool hey Liam I like what you did on LinkedIn um would you could we do something could you could you do something like this and you get feedback from the market market and you help to iterate towards something that people actually want so instead of guessing you able to iteratively sort of get feedback from the market and determine what people actually want and this is the most important thing is instead of trying to guess what the market wants we are in a position now where we have early adopters who are very interested in AI technology you just need to make content that attracts them and if they they come to you they will tell you what they want built and you don't have to guess and take 3 months just to have a stab in the dark and learn that no one wants it and there is nothing nothing more painful for myself or for the person here than realizing you've just wasted 3 months and no one wants it there is so demoralizing and I hate to see it in my community it really hurts I get on calls with people and they're like hey man like I've been I've been doing this thing for so long and like no one seems to be interested I don't think the nich is good BL it's because you've probably just had a stab in the dark at at what you're looking to do now I have another little diagram that I like to use that will illustrate this as well and it it kind of comes down to that that market feedback thing again and this should drive home the importance of uh doing inbound lead generation and building some kind of personal brand personal branding is really what I mean about this U marketing method maturation is that personal branding seems to be the way to go um I mean I'm I'm living proof of I'm living proof of it and we're seeing people all throughout my accelerator throughout my free community who are just taking this thing building Cool Stuff sharing it growing Their audience and that is a Sure Fire way to get the attention you need to start assigning clients now um if I draw two of these you're going to like this one this is one of my favorites so if I've got two two markets here and these are two different methods that these guys are going to be showing so in this market we have opportunity here opportunity here opportunity here and in this one we have the same opportunities now if I was to uh start off here so this is where I start off this is the guy this is the guy who spends 3 months learning and then just has a stab in the dark at what the market wants I think they want custom customer support for e-commerce and just has a dig there um so what this guy does this is uh this is time I'm not sure what the xaxis here is but it's it's a map right so over time this guy's going to go okay I think it's something up here so he's going I reckon this is what the market wants and this is this relates to product Market fit pmf so each of these Stars represents product Market fit and that this is something the C that creates value with an AI system that the market wants and are willing to pay a lot for so what this guy's done uh I'll I'll standy Joe over here he's just gone Liam talked about this this is what they want I'm going to pick a niche and just do it and over all this time he goes boop boop boop he might go right over that opportunity oh I've done that wrong maybe I do it over here skip right over this thing and then at the end he goes okay this is the product I've built and this is what I think and then he takes it to Market and finds out that no one wants it and then so what does he do goes okay well that was no good but he could have been he could have been right right bloody next to this thing right next to the opportunity but because he's come out here he's put all this effort in he gets dejected he's emotionally invested in that solution and immediately he goes oh well I need to do something else and so he starts working if he can Master the strength to try again he goes again and wait another two months between this and this and then again he's off and then okay that's game over he doesn't try again but thing is he was so close to it both times he just wasn't getting enough feedback from the market to find product Market fit and that may be because he's using cold email or some other kind of Outreach method that doesn't allow him to have enough conversations with people or get in front of his target market and let them tell him where to go now this one here product Market fit if you're doing inbound lead generation or and you're creating a person personal brand like I have with on my on my channel is you get much faster iterations so say I I'm a newbie to the space and Liam's just told me about the assistance API 2 and I want to get started I'm going to hop on there and to start building something cool and then I posted on my LinkedIn so um I'm going to go cool I built this thing boop boop boop boop I've gone to here and then this the market is going to tell me okay well that was cool hey how about you go over here and there was something I really liked about that solution you built could you do it for this so here is where I get my feedback from the market probably shouldn't do a star but you get it I post it on LinkedIn or I post on YouTube and people say wow that's cool how could it maybe do this or this would be great for this industry and that might this one comment here from someone this would be great for the for the Home Services industry and suddenly boom I've teleported over to here and someone has told me that there's an opportunity in the home service industry and then I can keep posting I can go boop boop over here oh and then the last time I land on the money and this is feedback from the market in the form of these orange stars by posting and sharing on LinkedIn or on YouTube or whatever you want to pick as your platform Twitter is great as well but just pick one and do it well and learn new stuff pick Bland pick the assistant API pick my own software agentive to build on top of the assistant API and when you share stuff and post it you're going to be sort of iterating towards one of these Stars rather than having a stab in the dark and as long as you can keep that frequency of feedback back from the market high in terms of I'm posting people telling me what I want I'm going to rebuild and go back and maybe I start working with some some free clients getting information because you got to find this product Market fit this is where value it's a simbi AIT relationship where you give value to them you're creating value for their business they earning more money and you can get a kickback from that if you don't find this you haven't got a good product you haven't found something that they actually want in the market and so now I get to explaining old mate uh Ernest Rutherford here so Ernest Rutherford was one of the finest men in my country New Zealand has ever created has ever our best export in the uh in the scientific realm he is one of the fathers of nuclear physics and is one of the best uh best regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time so this Ernest Rutherford I hope he isn't be feeling disrespected but he did look a bit like that I've been looking him up on on Wikipedia um but why are we talking about this and why does it apply to this the situation that we're in well Ernest Rutherford um they figured out there was a thing called Adam a while ago and him and his uh his crew decided that they would try to try to split the atom right and this does apply don't worry I'm not on a massive Dent here um him him and his team he was leading the team and there was two other guys under him and they performed an experiment in a a cider in their research lab and they were able to successfully split the atom and I believe it was helium or something hydrogen helium to hydrogen they popped off one of these these particles and they had successfully split the atom and they noticed within this splitting that a bunch of energy was released and it was this realization sort of proving of Einstein's um Einstein's theories that hey look this is the sort of makeup of the atom and it can be split and this energy that was released suddenly it was a big light bulb moment four physicists all over the world and it's like okay wow this has been done now if you've watched the movie Oppenheimer you know how the race goes the race was on to get to the point where you could weaponize this technology and create a bomb out of it and whether for for better or worse uh the race started and the United States ended up winning and they were given the nuclear bomb ended World War II on uh sort of a debatable terms but the race was triggered by this this discovery by these guys here so what I'm trying to relate this to what we have right now the assistance API Bland AI these market conditions and the widespread success of people in my community who are successfully marketing themselves with effective marketing methods now all of this stuff and this represents a technology um Tech that I mentioned so these are three points all of these combining is is like the the firing gun of the race not towards building nuclear bombs thankfully but towards making this thing work and making money with this opportunity so I wanted to make this video and really just highlight the factors that are combining um because it is really the race is on now we have all the tools we need you have the ease of Building Solutions you have two extremely powerful platforms voice agents which just blow everyone away that when you show them when you give a demo when you make a loom when you post it anywhere and you show the capabilities look at my video look at my channel I have a bunch of videos on voice AI there's so much cool stuff you can do here so much wow factor that if you post it on LinkedIn post on on Twitter wherever people really go holy crap that is some really impressive stuff and we also have the assistance API which is giving us best inclass absolutely incredible knowledge bases chat history custom chat GPT experiences that we can build on top of and my my software agentive is uh is built on top of this which allows you to agentive which allows you to build AI assistance on top of this we're in closed beta right now but you can apply I'll put a link down below um it is free um at the moment the assistant API you can build TX Spas agents on top of with massive knowledge bases that is super allow you to chat the data incredible tools that we have on hand now and it's really just a case of getting started picking one of them and and going at it so I want to leave you guys with some actionable advice here and I can't just make this video like hey get into this AI agency thing and not really give you some actionable uh actionable steps so let me get a little a little bit more Bean Juice than me the last step is going to be a little bit of a road map for you all cuz I want you to all do well and people I keep saying why why do you make these like why why do I make these videos why am I sitting here spending the whole morning on a on a fine Tuesday like this making this video and dancing around and drawing ugly pictures for you well it's because I found my opportunity in this AI space I was fortunate enough I saw this opportunity and said AI is going to be massive I want to be part of it and I'd done online business before I done e-commerce I'd worked in a i' built a social media marketing agency with a business partner this is the thing that I've finally been able to go all in on and the results in my career and personal life and everything have just exploded and I want you guys to experience that there's not much more time this is as you saw the graph before things are going to pick up there are more people are going to get washed out of other business models come back here because the tools are now there all it's going to take is for the people who are succeeding in my community to start making more videos start talking about it more and we're going to have so many more people coming to this so I want you all to find your opportunity in the AI space whether that's an AI agency whether that's consultation whether it's becoming an educator to some degree like I am there is so much in the space for us all and I I want you to to feel the the changes and and and life-changing changes that this space can provide I I am a living proof of that I'm so grateful for everything I'm grateful for you all who watch my videos I've built the life of my dreams and I want you guys to be able to do the same whether you're paying me or whether you're you're doing it or not but what I'm aiming to do with my career is to create Solutions and tools and and software that can help you to get onto this opportunity faster so I've built a software agentive and you guys can't everything that I do here is is based on you succeeding as an agency owner so I have to make these videos to to make you aware of this opportunity that I have to make other videos that teach you how to do certain things in the space because if you don't end up being successful agency owners and make money with AI by selling these Solutions then I will never get to where I want to go my team never gets to where they want to go so I am as much invested in your success as you you are helping mine right so it's it's it's a win-win and I I'm I'm fine to say that because there's enough people here who come on here online and and tell you that like oh I just I just really want to see you guys do well and I just love you guys so much and buy my course but no if you're going to buy my buy my course to my community or any of my software it's going to be so that you can make money with this thing otherwise there's no value being created and there's no future for my business so I am tied to you at the hip for your success here so the launch steps for you to start one of these agencies and start making money um let's go through one so I recommend well there's a couple different issues um that in to this this model and this opportunity face firstly it is uh what can AI do for businesses so what what can AI do for businesses this is kind of the found foundational thing where if you're going to be selling AI solutions to businesses you kind of need to know what they can do for businesses right so this is step one um and this is what I've tried to attack through my channel primarily we have resources in my PID community of course uh but I try to get as much of it out here this is kind of step one and so I push as much of it out on the YouTube channel as I can because if you guys get this then you you're sort of one step of the way there so this can come down to looking at my recent videos identify hey look these cool voice AI things that Liam's done the these things with these Tech Spas agents Liam has done so watch all my other videos try to put out as much as possible probably won't be doing too much more um here on the channel more these these Style videos um are what I like to do on the channel now I don't really I've done enough tutorials I think you guys can can figure it out from here but then we have number two um this is the second problem which is uh how to advertise my services and then we have number three how to sign deals so I I try to split it up into these three things when I'm uh when I'm teaching people so you need to know what AI can do for businesses so you can look look at the at a a niche through a lens and say okay well that's what that's what I can build in that Niche okay I can build an AI receptionist I can build a an internal use co-pilot that's going to be good for the marketing team I'm going to be able to do an automation that's going to classify the emails and auto automatically set outputs like there's this is the first step knowing what AI can do for businesses second is how to advertise your services which I've told you in this video um and I'm probably going to do a whole another video on as well on this inbound marketing strats but when you learn what AI can do for businesses you go out and build some cool stuff using low code and no code tools like I share on the channel and then once you've built some cool stuff you start to advertise your services and sort of go bounce back and forth between these two learn more share it learn more share it learn more share it build an audience like I have and this is going to advertise your services and and if you have an existing connection on set of connections on LinkedIn people are going to be like wow this guy he used to do landscaping and now he suddenly knows all the stuff about AI hey could what could you do for my business is there anything that I can do there are early adopted business owners who are curious so we can bounce between these two back and forth and that's going to advertise your services to people and soon if you're doing it right and you're building cool stuff people will be banging down your door trying to get you to build stuff for them as they were for me when I was doing my Consulting Services I started selling Consulting through my YouTube channel and then by the end of call they were saying well he can you build this for me like yeah it sounds great but I need someone to build it for me so what did I do I just made a development company I figured out that I could hire AI developers and start to sell these Services they told me what I needed to build for them I advertised my services and they came to me uh with their request after that then finally there's kind of another step here um is just knowing how you can convert this attention into uh into sales right so that's called a sales process and there's a bunch of different ways you can do it I don't want to get into it on this video but I I'll just point you in the right direction of you you need some kind of sales process which is okay if I have people who are hitting me up on LinkedIn uh let's say LinkedIn oh no that's not right we have LinkedIn okay so how do I get them from link well what's the end goal here which is sign client what are the steps between someone on LinkedIn commenting or engaging with me and me closing this deal and it's really just a case of plotting things out okay well I'm going to DM them here with X message and then I'm going to try to uh book in a call how do I draw a phone phone I'll get him on a call okay then I'm going to start them off on a a low ticket mean like low cost little little solution and say hey look let me just build this basic thing for you uh it'll take a day or two and I build a bit of trust and then I've now built some trust with them and I'm going to try to upsell them on a bigger ticket bigger ticket higher ticket offer and that's going to lead them that's very rushed but you get the you get the concept you need to break down step by step how you're converting this attention on say LinkedIn or for me it was YouTube they're going to come from YouTube see my morning side AI Link in in the description which you can you can use below if you want to get some AI Solutions built for you cuz we're we're open for business um LinkedIn and okay I'm going to shoot them a DM if they comment or if they're interested then I'm going to book a call then I'm going to offer some little check chatbot thing just to get a bit of trust going get them committed with your credit card then I'm going to try to upsell them to another thing and then I'm going to really sign them in a bigger deal you need to plan out this the signing process and learn a bit a little bit about sales which is infinite free resources on sales on this planet I'm not by any means a sales expert but I've been able to build a business that's generated me over a million dollars in the past 14 months now in the AI space without being in the AI space before so if I can do it and figure out how to close that many deals then I'm sure you can too but yeah that's about the crash course you need to learn what how I can do for businesses check out my channel check out my videos there's so much information out there and I'm trying to push it out through other YouTube as well then to advertise your services by posting on posting content on LinkedIn Twitter Youtube pick one and do it well don't do all of them or you're going to waste your time be Jack full trades master and none and then you need to figure out okay what's the process of me converting this attention into a sale so I don't know if there's much else I can ramble on about but thank you to Sir Sir Ernest Rutherford for his contributions to science and and to our success as agency owners and uh yeah I hope you guys have enjoyed that that one was a fun one um yeah I'm I'm just so hyped for this opportunity for you all and you can believe me you you don't have to but please at least consider it like I my life has been completely changed by getting into the space and as someone who has jumped around business models and I've done everything I never had the conviction that I was early to I never had the conviction in the business model that I was in that I had the good end of the deal that I was early enough that I could reap the big rewards I was always hearing from these other guys in space of teaching it like the Su guys or the Drop Shipping guys I'm like yeah well you've got a you've got a Lambo man like I'm just starting here you've been doing this thing for 3 years I'm just picking up the the brg I'm picking up the scraps here I'm writing your coattails and you're making me money selling all these solution selling me this course and selling me this but with the AI space as it is right now we are still early to it we are just getting started that's what I'm saying the fight the gun's gone off whether or not you take now is is up to you but this is something that you can commit to yourself and have a high conviction in the space you can actually commit to this business model and to the AI space for the next 5 or 10 years it's not going anywhere it's only going to grow and unlike Drop Shipping unlike social media marketing all these different things you are at the start of it and for someone who's never been able to go all in and be like wow this is the next I don't want to drop ship for 5 years I don't want to run a marketing agency for five years that wasn't something that really fired me up but building an AI agency building a development company building an AI SAS this kind of stuff is is just when I'm 40 or 50 and my kids ask you hey Dad how do you how do you make all your money I'm like I bought some really cool in the AI space and that's the story that I want to write for myself I don't know about you if you want to sell Chinese products online then be my guest but uh me and the guys in my community we're going to be over here building some cool AI stuff and changing the world one one one solution at a time so uh that's all with the video guys thank you so much for watching this has been helpful subscribe to the channel for more like this um I love feedback on these videos I'm still sort of ort of figuring out the best way to do them but I hope you guys are going to appreciate how I'm trying to get as much out as possible for these videos for you all but yeah that's all and I will uh see you in the next one leave a like if you enjoyed and yeah leave a comment if you also enjoyed so see you catch you in the next one"

              "text": "so what is the difference between a $5,000 AI agency project and one that's worth $105,000 in this video I'm going to be breaking down two client projects from my own agency morning side aai and you'll get to see the differences in resources and sort of effort involved in each of these because you're probably thinking that bigger is better right but that's not necessarily the case and it really comes down to what you want to achieve with your agency so in this video I really want to give you a clear look at the UPS sort of the pros and cons for each of these U because it's not all sunshine and rainbows and there are reasons why you wouldn't want a bigger client and you would want a $5,000 one instead so I'm going to try to break things down the factors involved in making these decisions so that you can better aim your agency in the right direction whether you want to do one that's cash flowing and sort of Fairly handsfree or you're trying to build a large AI development company and start to get bigger and bigger projects and you're biding on the long term so starting off with the $5,000 project this was a client who had a business base around helping people pay less on their car insurance claims so if you're in an accident you go to a repair shop they try to see well the insurance company wants to try and put as much of it as possible on you uh but there's a where you can go back and forth with them and say no this should be covered by insurance and that's what the business was based around and they had a a human operated system for doing the sort of back and forth and analyzing if there's anything in the in the invoices that they could sort of dispute and we were able to set up an AI system to do that for them so that was a $5,000 project the $15,000 project was a complete AI SAS platform build that we did from start to finish we did all of the AI backends planning systems built it from scratch all custom coded and we also built the front end as well so we call this one a car [Music] insurance claims and this one full AI SS and this was in the healthcare industry it was uh for nurses I can't go into it too much uh but it was in the healthcare industry helping nurses to come up to speed using these AI systems that we could train them faster on um so that's the two different size projects so you got a bit of context and for the I'll put Bing Bing some some screenshots on on screen there was just a single payment for this I believe um and for this it was three different three or four different payments and this is now on a maintenance package with us where we get paid monthly to maintain it and sort of add add not add features but we're just maintaining it for now um and also being there on hand to fix any bug fixes that come along so there's a couple key areas that I want to break down for for these so you understand the associated sort of pros and cons for each right so $5,000 project by Nature uh let me draw up a bit of a table here so if I have a table here we can start to sort of lay out the difference between the two in a number of different areas then we can have prod here so the type of project we can have admin we can have sales this will make sense in a second give give me a minute sales uh then we can have the case study value we can have the profit and then we can have the duration that's a clock um and then we can divide these up so these are the different sort of factors or or costs associated with them we have the project itself we have the admin time we have the sales time we have the case study value we have the profitability or profit of the of the entire build then we have the time that it takes so uh there's also other factors which you're going to but this is this we get us started for now so we have the project here we have the 5K oh 5K and this one down here we have the 105k so just putting it on quickly we had one hour here we had here and then we had 3 hours here and we probably had about 15 here so this is the time involvement on the sales side and on the admin side so just to get this 5K deal it's not $5 it's 5,000 just to get this $5,000 deal closed we had to do a an hour's worth of sales so that might be just two two calls one Discovery call and then one follow-up call just to get started and then that went into about 3 hours of admin so throughout the duration of the project which I can put down here uh which was 3 weeks um and this one was uh s of three and a half months so a lot longer right so you can see off the bat that the smaller project is easier to get on easier to sign um there's less admin involved throughout the duration of the build um and it's done in a in a faster man time right 3 weeks to get the money um and in this case we're spending over 10 hours of messing around with proposals and going back and forth and identifying the scope because it's such a big project there are so many more questions you need to ask about the from the client and do far far more Discovery and digging to really plan out okay this is the scope of the project this is what we're going to do um and then there this kind of awkward stage where like they know what they want but they kind of want to see the designs and see the plan and it's like well you need to pay us for that so we need to do an exploration uh there's quite a lot involved here as you can so for the customer to be willing to get into a $100,000 contract there's a lot of work and sort of relationship building that needs to be done as well then we have a factor here called the case study grade um and because this is a fairly basic AI sort of system that's not too flashy um you're really getting what might be handy case stud is always going to be handy um but this one is not hugely um in terms of impressing other clients like hey we built a $5,000 system for this kind of client it's not at least for what we're doing at my my company it's not hugely impressive um but complete AI SAS build is let's well you can always be better but we'll give it a 9 out of 10 we can show our clients that we built this end to end SAS and they like well well if they can do that then I'm sure they can do everything everything underneath that uh then we have the actual profit for this so on this build it was oh it was 3,000 and on this build it was 31,000 so you can see 5,000 into 3, 105 into 31 you can see the profit margins on these are very different uh this is over 50% and this is like 30% profit margins right so uh for the amount of time you putting in this is when you need to start evaluating okay well do I want to be getting sort of better Returns on my time here cuz this is 3 weeks You' did a quick maths here and you said okay this is going to be 1,000 profit ppw $11,000 in profit per week um 3 and a half months I guess you can say that 10K per month um go down to what two 2.3 maybe 2.3 um k p p week is that right with something like that maybe about 2,000 profit per week I'll get Shan to check the M on that but yeah so keeping these in mind you're going to make a lot more money per project in terms of profitability but this is going to take a lot longer you're going to get better case studies you're going to spend a lot more time going back and forth and this doesn't even factor in the the fact that in order to get this you might have had to have three to five of these in the pipeline that we've had lot of people interested in building these AI SES with us but very few get to the point of completion because it's a 10hour sales process and then they have to make these big commitments of $105,000 so this doesn't even factor in the sort of fail rate of this so we might have to put like times five on this cuz it's five times it's failed before we even get to one but in this case we might have just had five of them and it ends up being 5 hours total so hope that gives you a good idea of the different pros and cons uh obviously bigger clients bigger projects going to take more investment on the sort of relationship building and sales side there's bigger proposals to do there's more refinement of the proposal agreeing on scope much larger timelines just in general this is going to take you like a month and a bit or more just to get them to the point where they're willing to commit um you can use what we like to do which is an exploration Milestone which I think I'm going to cover in another video but that can actually break down the sales process and get these bigger clients on board a lot sooner but you'll have to subscribe or or like or something to catch that next one cuz I want to do a whole video on exploration Milestones I don't want to get sucked into it on this and there's actually one more thing that I want to add on here um which you can call sort of company culture um and the way that these different projects have an effect um culture um I'm going to have to do a bit of a quick job on this one but the effect on company culture if you're trying to build a development team and a a a collection of people who are inspired and feel like they're working towards cool things building $5,000 chat Bots or in this case sort of automation systems is is a way to get money in the door but it's not going to fire up your a players when you're trying to bring in attract and retain high quality Talent there's only so many $5,000 little chatbot builds you can do before they start going hey look I want to either get paid more or I want to go somewhere where I'm feeling more fulfilled because they have the skills to be able to go anywhere and get hired by anyone so they're really looking for what you can add on top of just monetary which is adding some kind of interesting aspect to it like hey look I just built out an entire AI s that could revolutionize the healthcare industry or I've just built these chaps so you have to look at culture here maybe I do red um the culture and the effect of it on the company culture goes down so we saw our team our development team was extremely fired up throughout the the entire build of this CU it was cool we're working with a client that we really liked the our client is awesome and we've got them on retainer now so he's we're continuing to work with them and we're like going to build future features into the platform longer term um but our developers got to work directly with a really cool client who had great values and was excited to work with us as well and the end result was such a great for our team as as us as this this startup this AI startup that started 12 months ago 14 probably about 12 months ago now um we were able to go from these small basic jackpots right up to knocking off a complete SAS build that the client was absolutely like wrapped they were so happy with the outcome and for myself my business partner Josh my CTO Spencer for all of us to be working on this project to completion and see it come together uh was a really really great moment and a high point for us as a team and and seeing that we could do these large projects and we could pull it off together so U the culture and the effect of these larger projects cannot be understated if you want to attract quality talent and retain them you can't just be feeding them sort of small projects constantly so just keep that in mind and this brings me backgr full circle to what I was saying before and I can rub this off now which is which kind of project should you be aiming for and that comes down to what kind of agency you want to build what are your goals with this business model what are your goals with the AI space are you looking to create cash flow and just get off the ground and be able to make money online so you can go live as a digital Nomad and and go to Barley and do all this cool stuff or are you looking to build Enterprise Value build a valuable team and in that case we can kind of plot it on a bit of an axis here um between okay over here is someone who wants maybe cash flow Freedom Etc and over here you want inpr value um great team culture and really high Le capable so if you're just looking to use one of these businesses to get yourself Mak your money online and get started then you need to potentially focus on these lower clients first right you I mean by first you kind of you can't really just jump to this so you're going to have to do these first anyway in order to get up to the stage where you can have enough credibility and and evidence that you are able to able to develop one of these uh but when it comes to picking where you want to fall on this on the scale you need to keep in mind that this is not these kind of businesses are not going to uh scale to these sort of valuations and exit sort of valuations that you might be looking for here so it's more of a self-awareness thing of knowing what you want out of this opportunity um and in this case for for for myself there's costs that are involved here as you saw the there was lower profitability there's higher admin and sales sorry that's really ugly but there are pros and cons to these so in this case you're sort of Bing on a longer term play and that look I'm going to sacrifice some profitability and I'm going to have to deal with more admin and longer sales processes Etc but I'm going to be able to create more value through the team that I build and through the culture that I'm building and the Enterprise Value over all of the the organization but in this case your profitability is going to be going way up while while net profits may not be uh be drastically different it's still in terms of input and output you're getting more more juice for the for the amount of squeeze you're putting in if that's a good analogy to use um and in this case uh there's less admin admin so there is a opportunity for you to create one of these lower ticket agencies so we can say that we wanted to Niche down to these car insurance claims um it's actually quite a small Market I believe so we didn't bother niching down at morning side to do something like this we could say okay I just want to do five of these a month or let's let's say three of them a month 15K in Riv and that was $3,000 profit a piece that would probably increase over time because the first time that we built it is the hardest and we had to come up with all these systems but if I was to replicate that over to another person's uh build I've already got all the systems I just need to tweak it a little bit so the profitability actually goes much further up um let me do like an extra big Arrow there if you're going to Niche down so in this case I haven't talked about nich and general agencies for a while on the channel um but I do throughout my community um and a and things like this the difference between a niched agency and a and a general one is that you're going to be able to focus on just one particular solution or or Niche and in that case you're going to be able to roll over the tech that you've built for the PRI clients into the future one so that it means is increase profitability because you're not having to come up with a new solution every time um now very few people get to the stage of doing this properly because we like to jump around and go I mean we're even doing the same thing at morning side because of the leads that come from my channel we like to stay General and do sort of cool things wherever we think we're a good fit for them right but if you're just looking to start off get a cash flow business and be making $15 $20,000 a month then looking at okay I can just focus on these small lower ticket clients and try to get cash flow and the freedom that I want and then maybe later once you've got a little bit more experience you can try to go for the more custom projects and uh and make more money that way but it is a longer term play and if you think AI agency as a sort of development company is to play for you this is what you need to go for but if you're trying to jump to some kind of SASS and you just want the cash flow and sort of the basic team you needed to do it uh this can also be a good option too so hope that's been a breakdown of the difference between the low ticket and high ticket clients it's not bigger is not always better is what I'm trying to point out here and it does depend entirely on your on your goals in the space and one more point that I want to make is that if you were to do like why $5,000 why not a $1,000 project well you'll find when you do the old gritomatic like I did before you'll see that the admin involvement of doing a $1,000 project is about the same as a $5,000 project or even a $10,000 project sometimes so there's this this kind of goldilock Sweet Spot Zone where you're doing the same amount of admin for more money which is why it morning side we have a minimum of $10,000 project so we just ignore anything that sub $10,000 uh just cuz it's not worth the time I don't want to be getting on sales calls my business partner Josh doesn't want to take them if we're going to make $55,000 cuz we know how much time Discovery call sort of closing call write a proposal write the contract send it off build it review it build it review it we get involved something breaks it's like not what I want to be involved in not how I want to run my business which is the point here which is you need to choose the client size based on your goals with the business and I don't want to be taking a ton of of sales goals with these guys but my my team would much rather be focusing on hey looks build one or two really big things occasionally um rather than doing a sort of high frequency sty style model here so to keep that in mind that the admin you will find um there is a certain Threshold at which you don't want to take the project just because you know how much admin is involved um so yeah that's the last thing I wanted to mention but that's all for the video um if you've liked and you like seeing me walking around here in a in a singlet um you can leave a like down below and let me know also for my drawings as well so that's all with the video thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "if you're still struggling to make money with AI then this graph is probably going to tell you what's wrong with your strategy and uh I'm going to help you fix it and understand everything about this there multiple layers to this um and I've also done an excellent drawing here so you can leave a like on the video purely for the drawing um but there's a lot to this and I'm going to try to break it down for you so that you can actually be successful in the AI space cuz not understanding what this graph means is is the most one of the most common reasons that I'm seeing of people not succeeding because it's if you don't understand it you apply the wrong strategies to acquire customers and it's really like the the foundational Paradigm of of understanding this the the adoption of AI technology which is what we are writing as AI Agency on it so this is called the technology adoption life cycle now what this graph uh outlines and really details let me get my other pin here um is the adoption of new technologies now we see this it's a pattern that they've recognized I'm not sure who I attribute it to but uh this is used to describe basically the adoption of any technology um and we have multiple stages here and the multiple stages represent different portions of the population and the speed and and rate at which they adopt new technology so firstly we have the innovators we have the early adopters we have the early majority early M um and we have the late majority late MCH and we have the what are these guys the lagard right lag guards so these are different sections of the population these guys are a handy dandy 2.5% these guys are a 13.5% I don't know who made these numbers up but someone smarter than me probably um these guys are I believe it's like 34% um these guys are another 34% and these guys are the remainder I can't remember exactly what no one cares about these guys really cuz we're not going to be selling to laggards um so forgive me for not remembering you do the math you figure it out um but so we have the innovators the early adopters the Early majority the late majority and laggards and in between these two we have what is known as the chasm U now was Jeffrey Moore has a book uh called crossing the chasm and this Chasm describes um the the Gap that forms between early adopters and the early majority that a lot of software companies uh struggle to bridge so you might get a couple of early adopters to your technology and to your to your software but you struggle to jump into this bigger pool of people and cross this Chasm which is got a nice little scale here um over into the early majority so that you can then start to sell it to more people so why am I telling you this well we sell technology and AI is a technology that we are selling primarily right so if we understand how these different segments of the population uh need to be marketed to how we can find them what stage we're currently at if you can understand this stuff fundamentally then you can create a strategy on how you can create and and run your business that utilizes the the underlying effects of the market so the market dynamics are absolutely key to understand or you're going to use the wrong the wrong paintbrush on the wrong canvas or something some fancy analogy there that makes sense but you're using the wrong Tool uh the wrong tool for the job basically so these each of these components well these these sectors have their own qualities to them U now you need to understand these qualities let's go through them the innovators are sort of more interested well they might have a lot of money often times they have some money and resources to throw out this thing cuz it's not going to make much money it's not very useful but this technology is exciting to them and they're willing to be invested in it um like I said they're more like Tech versus use case they see the potential in the tech more than than anything else they're not too worried about uh the rest of the stuff um so the innovators um then they have the early adopters the Early adopters are people who are kind of the The Visionaries and these are people who look at this technology that these guys have been tinkering around with and they go wow I understand how that can be used I'm going to try and create the first sort of implementations of that and stretch this from a little sciency like these are often academics academic oops these are academics and they're sort of experimenting around with things and then people bring it into these Visionaries and the early adopters will take it and sort of apply it to some real world use cases and start to stretch the capabilities so that it can really come into its own um these guys are not too much worried about the see they're more just excited right and they are are looking at this Technologies and new thing that they can take and take to the world then we have the early majority these are people who are a little bit more pragmatic I Matic uh they rely on more proof evidence and can best really be described as weight and C um so these guys uh the early majority the reason technology companies and and Technologies as a whole kind of fail to bridge this Gap and cross the chasm is because this early majority and every Beyond they want proof they want evidence they want to wait to be sure about something new before they take a risk on it so they're lot more risk ofers these guys are sort of Risk Takers and again they're they're more focused the early majority are more focused on the potential of it rather than the the current sort of efficiency and and output on right the early majority pragmatic need more proof they wait and see late majority it's a little bit more they're sort of a little bit more it's these guys are conservative these guys are skeptical now I'm not going to go into all this cuz we're not really dealing with with those guys um but what I'm trying to teach you and explain to you something that's made me successful in the space I've I've made now over a million dollars selling this AI stuff um and since I started my AI Journey so I feel like I'm kind of qualified and without understanding this I wouldn't have made nearly nearly as much as what I have so I'm trying to communicate this to you all because I'm I'm it really hurts me hurts me seeing so many of you trying to I'm waving these things around it hurts me to see so many of you trying to succeed and I know how hard you're working on your agencies and trying to build them and Sell Solutions but you're using the wrong tool for the job and it comes down to understanding this so stick with me cuz we got a lot more to cover all right so the early adopters and the early majority is really the focus where AI is right now is we are in this early adopters phase and we're kind of crossing the chasm into the early majority now who is our Market it's business owners so we need to think of this as not the consumer Market not not people in their their their Nan going on and using chat GPT that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the adoption of AI technology within businesses which is it's a different curve they all have their own places and and ages and stages but this is specifically for businesses now how can we take what we've understood from this in the different stages of people so these are Visionaries they're excited they're Risk Takers um that they want to try the technology and then want to apply it to to use cases and then we have the Gap and the chasm that goes to these people here who are a much larger section the 34 over over double nearly three times as much um so we really want to be tapping into these at some point but for those of you who are starting your AI agencies you may be looking at this and seeing an issue right so if I'm trying to sell to early majority who are wait and see they're evidence-based they want more proof they're pragmatic how in the hell am I going to sell my AI Solutions if I've never sold one before I don't have any proof I don't have any evidence the use case that I'm trying to sell them is not something that I have evidence to prove that works so maybe some these AI callers and the ai ai calling systems sure early adopted look at that like me and you look at that and go wow that's cool I see the potential potential we have Visionaries we see the potential of the technology but when you're trying to sell to people who need proof you're talk they're de it's falling on De ears so how can we tailor our strategy as AI agency owners when we're getting started to use this to our advantage and plan our strategy according to the different pools of people in the market so I'm glad you asked what you want to do when you are starting an agency is not go for these people because you don't have the proof you need to find early adopters and in order to find early adopters uh but they a small segment and I guess innovator kind of included in this as well right so that's sort of a a group that you can sell to collectively uh but in order to find them these are already a small segment of the population this is what um 14 16% meaning you have all of these people that you cannot even attempt to sell to without any proof or without any evidence as to as to the the the results that your systems can get so keeping this in mind how should we be trying to sell our solutions by C email by reaching out to people via Instagram by LinkedIn called DMS well I hope I've got enough room on the screen here but let's just say we have a a box of 100 people b b Bop this is 10 x 10 right 10x 10 and I'm sending my Cil emails and I have a list of thousands and thousands of people in this case let's just use 100 and I'm sending out these emails and um let's let's fill this out 5 6 7 8 9 10 um two three four um yeah there so this is Imagine This is filled out I'm not going to draw it obviously cuz there's uh there quite a lot but there's a lot more X's going on here there's 10 different rows of them now if use the wrong colors but you get what I mean if I'm sending cold email and I have a list of 100 people and 100 business owners that I'm trying to contact and I send out the cold emails there's only 16 people on that list who are even moderate like even open to buying and and use adopting this technology and that's that's pretty optimistic there might be none I mean this is if you get if you get a perfect slice in segment of the population you'll get this 16 people out of 100 you might get more you might get less depends how you build your list but if you're cold emailing it's likely going to be this or less so that means that you at a at a what 80 84% handicap where's my red I need to use red on this 84% handicap so you when you're sending out the cold email what's might be effective in other niches and other Industries we are at a massive handicap here when you're trying to send this stuff um so keep keeping this in mind the the real question should be okay if I'm trying if I don't have any proof and I'm just starting my agency and I have to be selling to this this early these early adopters and innovators how can I get my message in front of as many of them as possible Right have a think is it going to be I mean with volume if you send out huge amounts of volume you can negate this you can if you're only getting I don't know two people who are interested and then you're getting but then you even break this down even more say say you've got this amount of people are interested and you're getting only like a 5% 5% uh positive reply rate there's still very small numbers coming out of this cuz 5% of 16 what's that 1 point it's like it's like one right so there's not there's not much going on there and if you have these kind of numbers it's it's just like I'm working against you really which is what I'm trying I'm stumbling over my words a bit here but I get I get anxious when I have to do mouse on camera by the way I'm not sure if you do too but um 5% of 16 1.6 like .5% or something like that maybe we fact check it on the screen but I'm not good at mental Mass like that on camera anyway yes so I could have gone a little bit deeper here just to explain this so I thought I'd do it in the uh EDI process now um if we were to get a 5% positive reply rate and we had a total of 100 people then the whole box was filled with black x's and everyone was a potential customer we'd be getting five replies out of 100 right um what I was saying here is if we've only got 16 out of 100 cuz we're on the 84% handicap then only it ends up being 0.8 um of a person so that means there's one out of 16 is actually going to be a positive reply rate meaning instead of getting five replies for sending 100 emails you'll be getting one out of 100 which means you then you add that to the book rate and the close rate and you're basically getting no no clients right so yeah thought i' just add that in there hope this been helpful so going back to what I was saying how if this is the handicap we have when we're doing outbound Communications the only other option is well might be others but the only other main option here is to try to get these people via inbound lead generation methods which essentially is instead of me trying to reach out to the whole damn world and and fighting against this handicap of 84% or more I'm going to instead try to attract these people to my business and how you going to attract them well you can make content that appeals to those early adopters so in this case running out of room here so we have inbound inbound Legion so trying to attract the early adopters to your business is probably going to be and from the from what I mean I'm an example of it my morning side Ai and everything that I have achieved and everything that I've achieved the the small wins that I've achieved relative to other people in this in in the world but within the AI space I haven't done too damn bad My Success has come from attracting early adopters and innovators to my business morning side via inbound lead generation so I'm just sharing what has worked for me and what I'm starting to see the reason I'm making this video is because I'm starting to see an emerging pattern within my community of more and more and more and more people using the exact same strategy that I'm about to tell you to generate those leads and get themselves out of just serving early adopters getting them the testimonials and case studies they need so they can start to tackle this early majority INB Le generation LinkedIn Twitter I still call it Twitter X whatever you want to call it YouTube hell maybe even you start a Pinterest don't start a Pinterest I was just joking uh LinkedIn Twitter and uh and YouTube are kind of the uh the go you can do blog posting SEO whatever I just stick with these ones but the thing is you got to pick one and do it well I for example picked YouTube and I think I did I did it moderately well um you guys can be the judge of that I guess it's the like and dislike ratio on this video will determine if I've done it well or not but when it comes to money made from all of my businesses I'd say I've done pretty well on YouTube and you can do the same but you got to pick one and by picking one we get so many like I have never had to run any kind of advertising for morning site I've never had to run any kind of outbound Communications no Linkin outbound no Instagram outbound no nothing no cold email no nothing at morning site it all comes from my channel and my channel is more so focused on helping you guys now to start your own agencies and sharing what we learn at morning side so my content isn't even focused on selling to businesses like I'm not even trying to attract businesses to my audience but people are still seeing my videos who are business owners and coming to me to build these Solutions and bound lead generation pretty good if you do it right so what I'm seeing is a lot of success on LinkedIn at the moment uh LinkedIn is really hdden for a lot of people in the community particularly in my accelerator we've had some great uh success stories of people who we've just been an interview an interview an interview of people with the my accelerator and they all are using the same LinkedIn strategy U which is to generate inbound lead and okay so how can you generate the inbound lead if you were to take LinkedIn well what they are all doing and I mean what I've done as well on on YouTube it's not rocket science but you need to somehow get people on your LinkedIn so you need to gain connections you can just be spamming out connections within your given Niche just pick a niche starts trying to connect with different people you will get a high acceptance rate of connections people just like well yeah sure you can connect with me there's there's going to be enough people that you can just start to connect and build a bit of a base and then you want to be creating I should do it over here right so you go build a base or you might already have it already a lot of the guys who are succeeding quickly have already been working in another job or another industry and they just starting to convert their LinkedIn from their old career or their old Persona into this new I'm an AI expert and I help build AI solutions for this this this doesn't even need to be Niche Niche down you can stay General I bought AI stuff and find your Niche later but getting getting a little bit side and then you need to post cool valuable stuff and this way people will see that you know your stuff or know your uh it's probably how I would have said it if I wasn't uh wasn't limiting my vocabulary on here but you you need to prove that you actually know what you're talking about and in this way by posting stuff regularly and sharing what you're doing as I have on my channel look at my past videos you can see from the start the entire character Arc of my channel the reason I was able to do so well morning side and and we continue to do so is cuz I built a base of proving that I knew my stuff I was there giving coding tutorials of stuff that I had personally created and sharing it on my channel and then I hired developers who are even better than me and now I get them on my second channel on my morning side Channel I bring my CTO Spencer I bought him on the channel the other day you need to be proving that either you have a competency or your team has a competency um anyway I I'll leave that there cuz I don't want to don't want to get a little bit little bit too sidetracked on that that's probably talk for another video but there's the cliff notes of it um the more important thing that I want to talk about now is that there really is a a race that is on um the race is on for this early majority and this is what we've been we've kind of known it as we've been early to this this space and this AI agency opportunity that we've we've all HED on but we're still in this this period of the AI space right now we're we're in the the early stages but we are quickly moving into this early majority and crossing the chasm where there's now unlocking more and more people in our case more businesses who are willing to buy our Solutions but they're only willing to buy it if they have the proof the evidence they want to wait and see that the stuff really does what we say it does before they take they they take the red pull or the blue pull or whatever Matrix analogy you want to use there uh before they take the dive into using AI within their business they want to see the proof now for us if you don't ever get past this early adopter phase and you don't follow one of these strategies to get your first couple of clients and get some evidence and get some proof then you'll never be able to come and compete with myself and the other big dogs in the in the space I just called myself a big dog that's so cringe but um the other people who are actually doing numbers and selling these Solutions successfully uh we're in here well we can access here like there's still a lot of money to be made with these early adopters and they're far easier to work with because they're not really worried about they're less pragmatic they're not too worried about the they're just excited they're not too worried about the effects while they do want to see a bit of value if you're selling to these guys you may notice that you build stuff that isn't super valuable and they still happy with it cuz it's like wow that's cool my business has AI now these guys can be lovely to work with when we we get into here they need a lot more evidence-based proof Etc but as this Market progresses you're going to need to get into this point if you want to survive and if you want to really make the big bucks so this is the current competition within there's not much competition within the AI agency space because there's not many of us there's very very few of us who are actually on this opportunity and trying to make money off of it and many few of us who understand this and are doing well and and positioning this strategy in order to get this part done so that they can move into this early majority so there's not going to be many people after this video maybe a bit more there's not going to be many people who are in here competing for the big bucks really so that's my challenge to you all is that you need to use a strategy that factors in this Dynamic within the market that very few people 16% or thereabouts are actually interested in implementing the stuff at the moment if you don't have any evidence or proof and the thing is if you're trying to get your offer or get your business and your services in front of people you don't want to get in front of these guys it's you're wasting your time get it in front of these people and the most effective way to do that is to attract them to you instead of bashing on the door and saying do you want to buy some AI stuff yet just attract them to yourself and let them self select if you are connecting with people on LinkedIn and they see you're an AI guy I do AI for dental I do AI for financial services whatever it is if they see that and are interested they'll self- select and say cool I'll connect with this guy he's AI for financial services sounds interesting I'm going to connect and add it and then you build your base on LinkedIn and you start building cool stuff and while you're building building cool stuff you're also learning so you're you're making Leaps and Bounds in this thing every time you learn something to post it you're not only learning but you're also getting the marketing material to continue to show your your expertise and and build trust with your audience as well so yeah I just thought I'd throw down the gauntlet there and let you guys know that this is the challenge within AI agency space right now we are all brothers and sisters in this space which okay let's there's plenty plenty to eat for everyone let's deal with this let's all start creating content let's make a personal brand let's get out there and start engaging with people and building connections so that you can start to make money and get your start in this because I'm telling you if you Dilly dle around Dilly dle is that a word anyway you get what I mean if you mess around in this stage where we are here and we're very quickly jumping over to this as I'll talk about a little bit later but if you are messing around then you're not going to when the when everyone else mobs onto this this opportunity and they're coming very soon I'd say in the next next year I mean we're already starting to see other people telling these courses and and things like this and trying to trying to say that they know what they're talking about and listen honestly I've seen so many ads now it's kind of getting embarrassing what these guys are trying to sell so I would say that not to not to Big up what I'm doing and my team and there's only a few people in the space who are who are actually doing this thing and I I I tell you like I am I'm one of them and there's a couple of other people who I recommend on my channel and and things like so they are coming and it's evident by the amount of other people who are popping up and selling selling how to do this thing so that's the that's the challenge but if you D the around other people are going to jump in here and but you're going to spend all this time trying to get get your get yourself off the ground and then by the time you you get there there's going to be way way better way better agencies who have just jumped in here and are attacking this issue by because they tried to solve these problems so that they can attack this new market so now I don't want to rub this off because it does look nice and pretty um but I do want to layer over something else here that's also important considering on this fine Saturday we just had a uh a pretty big update from open AI which I think uh highlights another uh another factor that gets incorporated into this this whole picture so um we just had um I'm going to rub this off we just had the assistant API V2 release from open Ai and now this is a massive update this is something myself and the team at morning side um and and agentive my SAS platform we have been waiting for this this was really a bit that we made um 6 months ago now to say look the assistant API is a ridiculously powerful platform it has custom knowledge agents you can connect tools it has does everything for you the chat history management thread management tool calling very powerful package but when it came out it wasn't in a great state like it it was very ludicrously expensive very slow knowledge Bas was very spotty and so when we build a genive on top of it we had to deal with customers who are very well users who are very unhappy with uh the quality of of the the assistance API that we were built on but by association they think that our knowledge base wasn't working but reality it was the assistance API knowledge base it was not working so anyway enough of me coping um what I was trying to say here is that we have just had assistance api2 stick with me this is going to sort of light the fire under your bum now what also happens in these is say using the web as an example this is like early '90s 19 90s early academics so you can plot out the entire web adoption on this you got the academics early on who was like wow this internet's really cool it really didn't work and it was terrible um but they believed in it and saw the saw the saw the potential then you had people who came in in the sort of mid90s I'd say and then they were able to build companies on top of it you got the first couple kind of companies and people were starting to be Visionaries Visionaries and they were taking the the technology and pushing it to New limit and and finding real use cases for it and these this is is where we are right now with AI all of you watching this are seeing the same thing these voice agents chat agents uh these automations and and system like these and you're like wow there's so many use cases for this uh but in order to get to the early majority when it came to the web it needed faster like the infrastructure and the technology itself had to actually improve as well so it wasn't just H yeah like people had to kind of push it down here just by doing this busy stuff with it no the technology that was underpinning it had to improve and the infrastructure that allowed people to use it had to improve and what we are seeing why I'm saying this is what we're seeing right now is the ass API update is representative of this very move which is my brain F him started playing stop got a ghost on the keys in order for the web to progress into the early majority early M they had to have improvements in the infrastructure so the the web was faster the pages loaded better it looked prettier things that took it from this this early on like scientifically really n academic thing it had to get to the point where these early majority people were willing to adopt it cuz it made sense it was practical these people these Visionaries in the early 90s and bl innovators they're not too concerned about the practicality of these things they're more excited by it but in order to get to the early majority we need the infrastructure and the systems to make this thing make sense I will wait and see until it makes sense and what we have just been given a few days ago is the update that makes it make sense I'll probably put a video out on this in a bit but the assistance API V2 is let me get red so you really get the message faster more reliable it is also cheaper so all of these things if you were selling these Solutions via agentive or whatever you were selling you will understand that it was slow oh slow it was very slow it was also extremely expensive in the V1 and that's supposed to say reliable not relatable but um it was not reliable the knowledge base kep kept going on smoko as I like to say and kind of deciding that it wasn't working for that afternoon this is very much early adopter Behavior so like I'm okay with it being like this cuz I it's still cool and I like it and I'm in this bucket and I thought it was cool and I'm sure you are too if you played around with these gpts and AI agents but the assistance API 2 is a sort of coming of AE of this AI agents opportunity and Technology where it's going to start to make sense for a lot more of the early majority because it's faster it's cheaper it's more reliable and they have waited and waited and seen waited and saw you get what I mean they have waited around for the time for this kind of technology to get to the point now when we come to them and say hey look I can build you an AI agent that does this this this and this I okay well well how much is it going to cost me oh well it's only going to cost you this this and this we have techniques we can fine-tune the assistant API we can actually do a fine tuning so when we're testing it initially setting it up using gbt 4 you probably don't want to get that technical when you're talking to clients but you can say hey look we can start it off run some tests get all the get all the data back and then we can do a a sort of fine tuning of the system down to your specific use case it's going to be cheaper faster um and it's going to be much more suitable for your use case so thought I lay that in there there's also how do I how there some like I'm pretty proud of that drawing so I apologize for not rubbing it off and and giving you some new stuff but I kind of want to leave it up there for as long as possible you can overlay the curves let's say that this one is the technology itself so let's say this is the tech by Tech I mean the assistance API for the web it would be like broadband and and faster connections and and better better browsers and and things like this uh Tech and then laid over that you might have the actual adoption so you might have the adoption which is like oh and this is the actual adoption so it lags behind the tick we've just had new tick and we continue to see new tick Bland conversational Pathways check out Bland conversational Pathways check out this is the voice agent equivalent essentially of the assistance API wouldn't say equivalent I'd say the level of of complexity and polish on things like Bland conversational Pathways as a solution type of AI voice agents we're seeing this coming of age of the technology Beyond just what we're used to I mean when I started doing this stuff and you you go back and look at some of my videos when I was in my other apartment in Dubai and I was making these tutorials for people I was having to create custom knowledge chat gpts with custom code and all these difficult things and it would barely even work and often times it wouldn't work we struggled to deliver a custom Lodge chat B for months at morning time that was the level of the tick and now it's can take you probably 30 minutes or 10 minutes to create we are seeing leaps and bounce and the technology is maturing but that means there's this actual adoption lagging behind which is going to quickly oh oh look this is just the uh shift's kiss on this graph if I can do it right um where's my black this is taking me back to doing like economics and in high school or we see a shift in the curve to the right so this actual adoption curve is going to catch up to technology itself and it is our job and this is where we make the M this is our opportunity the m is in this shift all right I'm going to give you a second just to absorb that we we have new technology coming of age that it makes sense for the early majority all you need to do is facilitate this shift which is the entire thing that this opportunity when I start first started talking about it was facilitating the adoption of new technology now we have the new technology the new new technology which is much better and makes sense for the early majority so this is more so for urgency a big kick up thebat for you that this is we we're moving so if you don't quickly get this under control and get some inbound leads and start to close these early majority of these these early adopters you're going to have issues because we're going to be selling to these and and most of these guys are going to have their things built a lot of their needs of these people are going to be snapped up or they're going to be even worse they'll be psychologically conditioned to working with agencies who haven't worked well in the past this is what you see in the smma market and things like this where there's so many agencies trying to sell so many services that segments of the of the the different niches and stuff can get fatigued because there's so many Bad actors not technically are Bad actors but people who are selling Solutions who don't know what they doing and aren't able they just take the money live a bad service and there's a skepticism towards new new solution providers so these guys are still they haven't been screwed over yet or it's highly likely that they haven't so you need to move fast start a personal brand start talking and sharing about what you're doing learn and document the process so that you can and have some kind of strategy right so you may be thinking this doesn't make sense but any of these posting regularly as long as you have some kind of growth strategy which any of you have you all have fingers you can all search up on the Internet how to grow a LinkedIn how to grow on Twitter the information is there you just needed the strategy and I've given you the strategy you use one of these you learn on the job you share what you learn you hire these people you close these kind of CLS and that will set you up with the evidence in order to tackle this now you can continue to serve these clients cuz they're usually a lot nicer cuz they don't require this pragmatic angle on it but when the opportunity comes when this pull starts to be tapped out and when there's bigger money to be made here you are going to have the skills resources and testimonial and proof to start to do it now you have to forgive me this is my first one of these as you probably know um at the start took me a little bit to get going but um you can see once it get going it does sort of come together so if you guys want more videos like this this is so important like I I can't stress this enough if you don't understand these different segments then you're going to be do using the wrong strategy at the wrong time I mean when we do going back but when we do start to see this this pool open up that's when you can do the cold email you can still do the cold email now but as you give it a year or two this opens up and now there's 50% of the population who are like hell yeah like I'll get some AI in my business then you can start to do those Cod those outbound systems or better yet you can start to even do it once you have the proof you can just start setting them up because you need to you can't just run a call email and say hey hey I can build you a chat what do you want it he's like well what does it do for me how much does it cost is it going to be any like what if it doesn't work are you going to waste my time there's pragmatic reasons that you need to answer and objections that you need to handle so if you can have the testimonial and case studies and you can run the outbound um but it will take a lot more to get through to them a lot more proof but yeah that's uh that was cool I hope you guys enjoyed and I hope that was valuable I was going to say life for more white whiteboard videos but I don't think you can stop me now so I'm just going to keep doing these These are really fun and it's a pretty efficient way for me to communicate my worldview and the things that I've learned from uh well morning side is right there um from morning side and what I learn from my team from my business partner and things like this it's not just my brain here this is not just my brain this is the brain of my business partner Josh who was an absolutely killer entrepreneur better than me and my CTO Spencer who's been doing this NLP stuff for six seven years and the rest of my team as well we're all mining these Sol not Solutions but mining these learnings for you and I'm communicating it through this right and also just so you're wondering um why I do these videos I've kind of talked about it in my prompt engineering one but I want you guys all to know that reason I make these videos it's a selfish reason absolutely but I think that's going to be a lot resonate with you a lot more because get if I set up and said I'm doing it because I I love you and I really care about well yes I do have some of those feelings towards you and the people that I know personally from the community absolutely but people are motivated by self-interest and I am motivated by self-interest as are you and if I teach you this stuff and you successfully start to sign clients and you're making money here and then you start to S to early majority I have software that I want to sell to successful agency owners and if you never become a successful agency owner I don't win with my software so it's a win-win situation right I teach you prom engineering if I don't teach you that you will never make money with AI you'll never be a successful agency owner so my software becomes useless and has to users so all of these videos that you're going to see from me from here on out just so we're clear so that I can make you enter the best and most successful Agency on possible cuz if you don't make money I don't make money and I remain as a fce on YouTube guy forever okay hope you enjoyed I'll see you in the next one"

really changing things I think we're a couple of years at this point into the this revolution how AI can impact automation so I actually think this's this incredible opportunity uh for businesses out there and for our customer base to really adopt Automation and adopt AI oration hello everyone and welcome to the channel we have a special guest today Andy Burman the director of AI at zappia uh this is a conversation I'm very excited to have to discuss Central and how this going to affect us as AI automation agency owners and the kind of new platform we side to see with the no code low code side of things that could replace a lot of the the hard work we're doing on on more custom Solutions uh this was a an awesome opportunity for myself and for the community uh Wade that the CEO of zappy reach out after my recent video talking about Central said hey look let's let's see something up here and now we have Andy front of us so Andy wff it's great to have you yeah it's a pleasure to be here yeah well I don't want to waste one time here so let's just jump straight into zapier Central can you give us a an overview of of what you internally it's up here see it as being um and where it's looking to go um I think a lot of us have our own impressions of playing around with it seeing what it is um but it's definitely more of a hybrid uh than sort of one or the other so give us a bit of a backdown on at zapier We Believe Central is the next evolution in evolving automation for the AI age uh it's available to everyone in a public preview and it's a new AI workspace where customers can build teach and work hand in AI Bots I think if you if you're familiar with what's going on in AI today everyone else is calling these AI agents and these are Bots that you can customize with your business data and they can handle tasks across 6,000 apps and you can accelerate your business they also have access to Dynamic data sources um today that's notion Google Sheets docs um a number of others and air table yes air table that came out this week new addition and new addition and uh coming soon uh you'll see a number one next week and so what those allow you to do is build workflows um off of processes that are stored in your documents or your your databases and really what it does is it puts are customers in the driver's seat to automate even more work with uh their friendly AI Bots well yeah I think uh the very interesting part about Central if no if you're watching list you have you had a chance to jump in and take a look um it's the combination of what we would be used to with gpts and open AI kind of kind of jumping in there and creating these conversational agents you can have knowledge you can have tools but you guys have taken that a step further and and combining what I've always sort of seen as a bit of an issue with with agents in the in the Cent state is that the sort of scheduled backend tasks that don't necessarily need a conversational input you guys have have tied that into the same interface so can you give us a breakout of the human and the loop aspect and sort of trigger when I send a message versus the the sort of more suggestion automation side and why you brought those together into well yeah I think from our perspective is there really isn't these aren't different platforms so I think there's a synchronous use case when you want to chat with information when you want to chat with your data or chat with your knowledge source and then that typically leads to how am I going to automate some process and those processes can happen once a day they can happen once an hour they can happen once a week and we want to enable those workflows for our users and the goal of this is to make it much easier to run complex workflows at Z on zappier and to do that in a much in to get time to Value much faster so really allowing you to get up to speed get a workflow built in in a lot less time than historic than it was historically possible it's up here yeah I mean it's uh it's still kind of hard to explain to people just how much of a big leap this is and and it's the I try to describe zap essential and and sort of the AI glue that's holding this together as some kind of glue it instead of having to pair up the the inputs and outputs of the different steps and your and your when your zap automation it's the AI kind of intelligently being able to pluck and and and pull them into the right field as they go so um what's the the most difficult part of that be you I know the sort of content space and trying to get things working there but uh I much more improvements coming on the on the aiite kind of there's some some speed issues um what are the what's the road map for these next next improvements for for Z Central in the short term well I think it's everything from speed uh to a number of ux improvement to Integrations that you can imagine with a lot more data sources and I don't want to give away all our secrets secrets but I mean we're shipping improvements on a daily and weekly basis right now and it's it's day one that's really where we are for Central today yeah I I mean I think that the most surprising thing for me when as soon as I got in there was the dynamic data aspect which is something that I haven't seen done done anywhere youw of anyone else that who's who's providing Dynamic data options I'm not it's a great question I was hoping you could answer that to me because it's come up like a bunch this week I haven't seen it no that's why I was so shocked when I saw it I said man this is something even for for my my oess which is just sort of the people compar to what you guys are trying to do but we're we're looking at solving this knowledge Bas problem with y High ecosystem in particular um and saying look how can we make Dynamic knowledge basis where it's very easy to manage the information inside of them um and I think that's that's such AAP that you guys now are offering that connection to to Google to notion to air T and things like those to be a to chat with data because if you're having some kind of central uh centralization of of say where the CEO of business or the opsy business can come on and say okay let me let me try to manage a lot of the business from this this point of view uh not having Dynamic data makes the thing completely useless right there like well I've I'm trying to ask questions about my my my sales data from e-commerce store and it's it's not it's not Dynamic it's no point yeah I mean my favorite example is always a salesperson so after they get off the call what it'll end up what you can end up doing is you can compare the competitors mentioned to what's in the what's in a Google doc and the competitors can be added live so a sales manager or somebody else can be constantly adding to this data source and if the salesperson forgets to mention a competitor or it it can then DM them and find the user and this concept of dynamic data sources is really far into the end user because in chat jbt the only thing you can really do is upload a file and now instead you can connect to one anything from to one of your no to notion or a Google sheet and as those data those data source are constantly updated we're running a connection and you can run your automation from that in addition to just chatting with the data and I I think from my from my self- thought developer level of understanding it seems like you guys are taking in uh from my my own playing arounds that you're taking in say she converting to CSV and then putting that into a into a database structure then you're also writing the queries against that so you're doing text to SQL to in query of those different documents right because I tried it off with one and it s of seems a little bit overboard to just deal with one document but as soon as you have lots of different things connected in there it's like okay well this is why they've done it this way they're doing full text seq translation to look up the information at it um the like can database I'm not going to tell you all our secrets but what you can do what you can do is is you can we show you if you if you actually in the product we show you what some of the code is actually running so for a more advanced user you can get a sense of what we're doing okay yeah so yes but I can't say it okay uh anyway for for my w is particular and and our community here we're very much focused on this AI agency opportunity which is something that we've been really pry hot on about this time last year which was I had my own development company and then we started to see that we could delivering custom coded AI Solutions uh we could also deliver the same custom mod chat was typical thing to a selling but with these low on code and no code tools um and that's kind of what all this the this opportunity has been based on and the community we've built here so for for agencies and people are looking to build and Sell Solutions how do you think we can plan our our usage of of central because I know zap is very much intended to It's s the the most friendly on the on the agency side is definitely let's get a set up on the business and the business can manage it so for us as agencies wanting to make the most of the central opportunity uh how can how can we get involved is there anything you'd recommend for us to be a to use it as an agency rather than as a bus themselves so I think for agencies in general what this what central opens up is really vast playground to innovate and offer specialized AI Solutions I think our product is from an agentic workflow product one of the most if not the most F head product in the market and I think what we consistently hear from our customers is this is the type of tooling they want to adopt in the in their company and these and so I see there's a massive opportunity where central as a product today where we are it's a the product launch on MAR on March 6th in public preview and so we are right now we're not monetizing it and we're focusing purely on building the product getting feedback and so agencies like yourself I'd love you to get on it I'd love you to implement it with customers and I'd love you to start getting feedback for us and what you'll see for us over the next couple months is we're really innovating we're really changing things and it's the first time we've ever announced a public preview historically we released things in alpha or beta this is time we're building in public with the community and so I think as an agency there's a lot of opportunity need to help shape our road map yeah noticed it was quite a quite a quiet watch not sure if that was intentional or not but seemed like you didn't want to I mean with anything when you try to build up the scale to deal with thousands and thousands of new users on it it's probably in your best interest to say okay let's just because no one was really talking about it when I put my video out it have been out for a little while so I was like this is can't believe this hasn't we talked about War uh I go back to what you said on the pricing side of things is there anything you can tell us on the pricing side I thought man if this was if I was ready Z year this would be the smartest way to just drive a whole bud more usage to to like charging on zaps on a usage basis so is this exact the kind of play here where it's okay we can make it the easier we can create make it to create this Automation and set up these uh these these apps um the more usage we're going to use and the more R we going to drive so what's the the pricing strategy since you're not monetizing it yet are there it going to be more of just a app based or or some other some other method um I think in everything that we've seen in every every tool that we've seen in AI um it is usage based so I I'm not familiar with anything in the agent space that's not a usage based tool right now because models themselves are usage based and compute themsel and computed self is usage based so aw AWS and say anything from anthropic to open AI to Gemini um I think you'll have to stay tuned to see what the actual pricing model looks like right but I promise you it'll it'll be helping our customers and our agencies Drive value for their customers yeah I was thinking it might have been a uh a case of if you're going to undercut open AI you could say okay we make our money on the on those zaps on the actions um but we can we hey don't worry about the don't worry about the tokens you that's just just a a little great but okay we'll have to wait on that um another key question that everyone seems to be bashing down the door about is uh the option of deploying the Bots you create to other platforms I'm not sure maybe there a lot of my my people who watch my channel they see me putting chat bots on websites and on WhatsApp and on Instagram DMS and things like this is there any plans to allow I know there are some zaps that allow you to send messages uh on a Facebook Messenger bot for for Facebook page um is there anything intended to allow Central to get outside of central which is probably about country children but that's that's questions they'll asking so I think for website zapier has another product called chat Bots um and I I think for embedding in web that's a really good product that I'd recommend your users check that product out I think zappier as a company has always listened to our users and I would sit there and say I would expect there are ways to interact with the bot with other internal tools coming in the future um but again I think as I said with pricing it's anyone today can try it that's the beauty of it and we want your feedback and all you have to do is go to all you have to do is go to to zapier.com Central and you can check out the landing page and take a look at the product and we're learning we're learning from our users this is a new product and it's a new medium and I think we're a couple of years at this point into the this revolution of what AI can actually how AI can impact Automation and so I I would recommend you try it and I'd recommend giving us feedback and from there we're going to implement what our customers want all right you guys you guys heard it right just uh just Smash in the the customer support and we'll get the fees we want maybe if we as a community can s together and just just tell zapia exactly what we need to to make money with our Solutions so uh be nice to our support FKS they work really hard oh don't worry ifone if on this channel is really nice they they leave me lovely lovely comments as well uh compliance and uh gdpr and things like this this is always a question that comes up for agencies in particular saying hey look if I'm going to be selling solutions to uh to people uh a lot of the that the C customer themselves is going to be coming to us and say well okay this AI stuff is really concerning with the the data where it's going anything you can tell us I know sometimes there there's a whole guy for managing this and you might be a little bit heads off because I know it could be a Missy issue but is there anything you can tell us on the side G think so that's uh could could uh get allow us to pass it on to customers and say hey look Eddie bman and and the zapier team said this this is this what they said so I think zapier is one of the most trusted brands in the a automation space and I and you've come to expect a lot from us uh and what I would say is I would expect in the future those exact same compliance data and and such coming to this product today we're in public preview uh we're not training on user data we're very transparent on the landing page and the FAQ of what we what is available today but just be but the reality of this is it's it's an earlier product so we will be building towards all this in the future okay uh well that's that's a lot of the community questions out the way I think it's more important uh or interesting now at this point point in the interview is to talk to you Andy about uh your thoughts as the as the Director of AI zpp here you must have some pretty interesting insights and opinions on on where the space is going um so do you have any any hot takes or any any opinions that you think might be interesting for people to share about the Ari witho space and is it going to be a a Doomer and are going to sort of spir the way into into into chaos or do you think it's going to be more of a gradual approach there's so many different vewing view yes I'd love to hear what you have to say so I I I I'm an optimist so I don't believe it's going to go towards chaos I actually think there's this incredible opportunity uh for businesses out there and for our customer base to really adopt Automation and adopt AI Automation and what I think AI does is it really makes it so much easier to adopt some of these incredibly complicated workflows um I'm familiar with a customer Seiki chat and Seiki spent 20 hours building a one of those 40 step zaps that does multiple model calls um at multiple different time periods to automate a lead funnel which I think is a pretty popular use case and then draft up communication what I see is instead of spending 20 hours on a holiday weekend a customer like Seiki is going to be able to uh get this up and running in significantly less time and I think that's a win for everyone in the room I think what you're going to see from us is we're going to be shipping constantly shipping Cutting Edge AI based automation Solutions that'll be across the core editor the classic editor product and across some of our new products whether it's chatbots or Central or canvas um or tables and interfaces you we're really iterating and we're we're pushing out a lot of products to en to enable our customers and our community to take advantage of what's what's going on in the ecosystem yeah that's uh that's another thing I wanted to touch on is is canvas I have have tried to have a play around but it didn't seem to I love the concept but I'm not I'm not quite seeing it yet so is there anything that I'm I'm missing there it seems like if I could be able to put in a chat Point as a data source and connected from there what's the status of that I know it is a beta uh but is there any any information you give us on on us as agencies selling his AI automation Solutions how canvas might fit into our potential offering in future yeah I I I think what it's very canvas is incredibly helpful for is diagramming uh and and thinking through a system design and then working with and as you're building and as you're building that system highlighting to the customer the steps of the workflow and I think it's a natural extension as you as you start moving all on zappier um to to be able to integrate tables inter interface chatbots uh the classic editor and show the customer that you're working with how does this all play and I think as the products and data we're still learning also but I've started using it internally for incredibly con complicated systems and it gives you a lot of insights into how everything flows together um and so I I only started using it about four weeks ago myself uh but I've seen a lot of advantages to seeing how a system actually can work and and being able to audit some of the data on the zaper system across across a lot of different products yeah so so are you saying it's CU when I was in there it didn't really seem to have much sort of functional F us is it's more of a a diagramming thing as you said kind of like a a zapia figma where I can see everything laid out and how it all fit together or is it intended to actually connect different parts so saying if I have a table and if I have a an actions or I have zap set up and a chat bot okay is that where I can actually connect them or is it still more for visuals around the actually the system themselves it's going it's from it's system design into actually going to Automation and then being able to share this document and keeping your team aligned on basically all all the processes in your AI system if that makes any sense awesome yeah I mean I think part of the key the key questions of this conversation is is is there an opportunity for a zapia specialized agency an AI agency that says look there there the gbt's opportunity I could specialize in creating AI agents over here I could specialize in doing backend automations here but I think what we're seeing with Central as a as a a lure to to bring more people onto the platform is there the opportunity to specialize as as zap your specific agencies as Hal it's whole ecosystem it's what we specialize in and I think that's that's a a completely valid opportunity for people are looking to get into the space and as just said they are shipping incredibly fast and part of this conversation was just to confirm people who are confused or that unsure if you want to go all in on not necessarily all in or even just spend the the week or two that it might take to put some Solutions on these platforms um that it is worthwhile and it's not just another another platform that's coming up um so Edie uh that's been a pleasure talking to you thank you so much for the clarity you've given us on what we can expect from Central and South moving forward uh and I'm extremely excited to share some of the use cases and upcoming video I did a hackathon on my on my free community $1,000 giveaway and we got 20 submissions or so of all these awesome Central use cases so Andy I'll have to flick you a link to that video once it's out um there's some very cool things that people thought up in the community so it's been a pleasure and uh hopefully be talking to you very soon awesome and does the uh giveaway apply to me can I show you what the team's building and we can get $1,000 yeah we might have to run run it back and do another one Andy I I'll flick you an email all right it was a pleasure being on Cheers Andy but"

              "text": "you probably suck at promt engineering and in this video I'm going to tell you why how you can fix it and how you cannot be the guy in the middle here of this mid with me so that's might a little bit off topic but if you give me a second I'll explain how this applies to the majority of people who are trying to do prompt engineering and build AI systems and why it's probably holding you back because you're stuck in this midwit range so if you haven't seen this meme before basically the low IQ people and the high IQ people kind of converge on the same solution uh as you see here so we have the guy using Apple notes on one side and the genius using Apple notes on one side and in the middle you have the midwit who's over complicating it making it very difficult and painful for themselves and then we have the same thing with NES Cafe Classic on both sides and in the middle we have the midwit struggling with all these different types of coffee and fancy methods so how does this apply to prompt engineering I know you're asking considering you clicked on a video that's about prompt engineering but it's actually a not so bow curve when it comes to prompt engineering and uh on the far left we have the stupid person who is just using chat GPT and prompting it as they wish kind of just throwing things in there on the far side we have what we're trying to get you to after this video which is a genius who has a toolkit of prompts and understands the science behind it and in the middle we have probably you right now which is uh I mean no no disrespect to these other YouTubers cuz I've made videos on on proing myself like I'm I'm I'm part of the problem here but uh what these are all about is chat gbt prompt templates and and sort of taking the thinking away from you and putting it in the hands of this template that they've created so uh I'm not going to sh on my videos too much uh because these videos were talking more conceptually as well so I'd say I'm on that line and the content of this presentation in this video is intended to take you from this plateau of someone trying to do PR engineering but not actually understanding the the science behind it which is what we're going to go into this video point of this video is to take you from someone who's on that Plateau as you can see here um and get you up to the sort of genius and and very capable PR engineer who's able to do great things with these language models and it's so important because your ability to prompt them and and provide instruction of these models directly impacts your ability to get value out of them so if there's this amazing new technology called llms and you're better at using them you're going to go further in the AI space and further in life if you can better send instructions to these models so continuing on uh you may be wondering hey why is this new style why is the camera on the different side why is everything so casual um and that's because uh I've been wasting a not wasting but I've been spending a lot of time on my videos uh the past while as you may have noticed some of you people starting to think that I'm a YouTuber um and I'm I've never really thought of myself as a YouTuber personally um I'm a businessman and YouTube is how I get clients for my business and I think you guys are starting to see me as a as a YouTuber and I I really as much as I love making videos and teaching you guys everything what I really like doing is working on my business and working my team and building the cool software that we're building through genive and work on the morning side and also the cool stuff we do with my my education Community as well and teaching them how to start their own businesses like I so probably less Fancy videos that require a lot of time and editing and and if I have anything interesting to share and I want to talk about it like in this video because this video is coming out of me seeing so many people that I talk to in my community not understanding this fundamental skill and it is so fundamental but people have this misconception that they know how to De it which I'm going to break like just absolutely destroy if you in this video uh and rebuild your skills as a prompt engineer so doing this because if I have something to talk to you about and I think it's important for you all um then I'm going to share it and also you may be wondering why do I do this at all and it's because I have a SAS and it helps agency owners to build AI solutions for businesses so if I don't teach you guys how to do prom engineering you're never going to use my SAS so I have to do this stuff so that I can succeed and and make all the money with the SAS that I want so I'm you guys get a byproduct of me trying to build my SAS which is helping you to learn these things so anyway atics so why you're probably bad at prompt engineering have conversational prompt engineering versus single shot conversational is what everyone thinks is prompt engineering and they go onto chat GPT and they go hey hey yeah I got this got this cool prompt template and they Chuck in there and they can get some responses from it and they're like man I'm so good at this and then they switch off and think that they're a prompt engineer and they know how to do this stuff um this of course is human operated there are follow-up prompts that you can do so you can say oh could you please like modify this a little bit and because of these follow-up prompts it's very forgiving in terms of what you can say um and how you can tweak it to get the RO responses and this really is just good for personal use if you're working at a job and you might want to streamline some of the work play that you do there great like I mean Chad GPT is an incredible software and I use it the time as well so I'm not not on it but it is conversational prompting and on the other side is single shot prompting which is something that we can actually bake into a system uh that can be automated and can be part of a sort of ongoing ongoing system or flow uh where an AI task is embedded in it um there are no follow-up prompts because there's no no human involved in most cases there's no room for error in that case you can't have jgpt putting hey here is the answer and they put in the answer it just needs to give you the answer every single time while the system's going to break uh because of this because if we can prompt it into something that is reliable we can actually have a very scalable system that is AI built into it which is ideal for these AI assisted systems and this is really how you can create value so the benefit of conversational prompting skills which many of you will have I'm sure is that it might make you better at your job and might make your boss a bit more money CU you're able to do more work um maybe make you a bit more money on the on the process but the benefit of these single shot systems where we can build an AI task to do a specific function every every single time reliably is that it will allow you to build AI systems worth potentially thousands of dollars a piece as as I've done as many people in my community have done as well if you don't believe me I don't care furthermore on this point of why you should take prompt engineering seriously Andre Kathy here uh says the hottest new programming language is English and this is no dummy he is a founding member of open AI he's also a leading AI researcher what he means here by saying the hottest new programming language is English is that you being able to write instructions in English is going to allow you to one generate code if you want to so you can translate from English to codee that's one way of programming in English technically but another way is that if you can write effective prompts you can replace the the the programming required with a massive program or a massive script you can write a prompt that effectively does all of the things that that that script would have done so you can replace large blocks of code with a well-written prompt now which is really what I want you guys to focus on and say well I can have the abilities of a developer if I can write these prompts well using llms properly um and furthermore this guy also this guy Liam otley I've founded a couple AI companies I have my own AI agency Morningside AI I have my own AI education Community uh my tripa accelerator and I also have a software U my AI SAS called agentive which is really what my focuses on right right now and I've got some pretty smart people working for me I'm not the brains of the operation anymore I I hope I was at one point but my CTO Spencer has like five six years of NP uh experience and he does some really cool stuff for us and a lot of what I'm going to sharing in this in terms of how you should be doing your prod engineering and what I've learned and what I now use is from him so you might think I'm just some goofball who's been doing YouTube for 12 months uh but I do have teamed and I've paid people who are a lot smarter than me to give me this knowledge so now I'm giving it to you so now I want you to remember this a well-written prompt can replace hundreds of lines of code going back to what I said before this is I think it's my quote but I'm just going to say someone said it cuz someone must have said it but that's essentially what you can do if you write a well-written prompt um now here's an example so there's there a video that will have just gone out recently on my channel where I manage my phone finances with AI I set up a system where my assistant can send money I can send screenshots these things here through the system and out comes the other side a tracker for all my expenses within my notion um it automatically extracts the extracts the transactions from the screenshots categorizes them stores them in my expense data database within the notion and this is kind of the system here you can pause and take a look but basically so it took me 2 hours to write a very good prompt that can success categorized format and then pass the data over to notion um and that's ended up saving 8 hours per month for my system so example there not the best one but you get the idea um if you write a good prompt you can replace what would have taken like to me for me to do this expensive system with code would have taken a a whole lot longer and it would have been extremely messy um but the AI can just throw all the information at it say hey look this is what I want you to do with it and outcomes the transactions ready to go into notion and no we're still not ready to move forward because you need to understand that if you can just get this skill right that many people don't have correct they think they can do conversational prompt engineering and that's going to be enough for them to go in and build these systems but in AI voice systems which are all the rage right now I've done a ton of videos on you can go watch them on my channel AI voice systems if you can't prompt correctly if you don't have good prompt engineering skills you can't do AI voice systems if you don't have good prompt engineering skills you can't create AI agents like gpts if you don't have good prompt engineering skills you can't build ai's tasks into AI automations like on zapia and make Etc and you can't build custom AI tools on relevance and stack Ai and these other platform so if you can't just get this thing right and watch the rest of this video it's not going to be a retention hookie and and for your Tik Tok brain I don't care if you watch the rest of it but I'm telling you if you don't take the time to actually soak in this information I'm about to tell you and and get good at this prompt engineering skill you are not going to make any money in AI because everything depends on it and finally what I want to do is a little comparison of the two different types of people you can be you can either watch this video and come out on the right side here or you can continue to do your whatever you think you're doing when you're prompt engineering um and you can be like the guy so go on the left the midw he has a handy bag of prompt templates he gets stuck when something doesn't work because he doesn't understand what what the template's even doing so then he uses a more expensive and a smarter model like he moves from 3.5 turbo to four turbo and he goes oh yeah well now it works because he gets the models to do the work inad of himself so by doing this he creates slower and more expensive systems and therefore he struggles to create systems that are actually valuable for the clients cuz if it's costing them a lot and they're really slow there's less value for the client right and then number six he gives up on trying to start an AI business and get into this AI solution space and then like some of you guys in the comments they become a triaa as a scam goofball and blame it on the model and not your inability to learn how to write English and then on the right we have the guy that you want to be uh he has a toolkit of prompt components and methods based on Research which I'm going to take you through in this video he approaches problems like an engineer he skillfully applies these techniques he achieves the desired performance with fastest and cheapest model available so he uses the cheapest model he can get and uses his skills to make it do what he needed to do therefore he's able to create lightning quick and affordable AI systems for clients that create actual value because they're cheap and they're fast and then therefore he actually makes money because these clients like wow this thing is awesome and number seven this guy then finds other AI Chads like him who know how to do prompt engineering and are making money with AI and with him and his friends they all get AI Rich um yes I'm selling the dream there but that is what's possible if you can get this thing right and that is what myself and a bunch of the other guys that I was just namam with they're all doing it uh it's happening um whether you like it or not so be like this guy don't be like this guy um yeah there you go so now we get into the perfect prompt formula for building AI systems which is the meat and poates of this video um Beware Of The Prompt formula as I mentioned you don't want to be the guy who relies on the formula and while is while I am giving you a formula in this video I've put it in asx's and user capital letters so that you understand that I'm kind of taking the piss out of formulas because what I'm teaching you in this is going to be the science behind them um so that you guys if you run into an issue you'll understand hey look I can apply this technique to try and fix it so you'll actually be able to write good prompts forever if you understand the stuff I'm going to teach and you actually absorb it so components of this prompt are role task specifics context examples and notes and behind each of these components is a related uh scientific paper or some research that has been done or some prompting technique that has been discovered and backed up with a research paper that you can see on screen here we have roll prompting Chain of Thought prompting emotion prompt F shot prompting and lost in the middle all of these are going to be covered in the next section to this video so let's jump into it um oh before we do that actually what each of these techniques have is a increase in accuracy or performance for props and I'm going to retention hook you here with all these question marks because over time we're going to reveal just how much performance improvements you can get so if you stack all of these up together uh you get an increase in performance on your PR um just a lot of these are very easy to implement um but you're going to get a massive increase I'm not going to tell you how much it is but a huge increase just by applying these simple simple techniques so we're going to be using an example for this video which is an email classification system uh and the the AI task here in the middle uh is where we're going to have be sending our prompt and in this case it's going to be someone comes onto uh someone's website they fill out a form that form then gets sent the form submission gets sent by email to the company the CEO or the Ops guy uh to his email and he gets it and then normally has to read through it and then classify it and and take action from there but what we're going to be doing is imagining a system where there is this AI task or this AI node and make.com or whatever you want to use where the email comes in and then it's going to be classified using our prompt into opportunity needs attention or ignore label so super basic system I wanted to use as an example here let's get into it um we're going to be building up a prompt over time of of how we can apply this techniques to make the to make this thing better and perform better so starting off we have the typical chat GPT prompt if you asked any mid midwit well not even midwit this guy's the stupid guy uh if you asked any regular uh bottom feeder chat GPT user they' probably give you a prompt like classify the following email into ignore opportunity or need detention labels and then they' paste in the email right so this is our starting point this is the typical CHT prompt and this is as far on the on the IQ scale on the left as you can go so we're breaking down by component we're starting off with the rooll I know for you Tik Tok brains here you're probably going to look at this and be like ah there a lot of writing but uh can you just pause this video uh I'm not going to go over all of it I think some of you already know some of these components Ro prompting is something that you've definitely done before but I want to draw attention here to the research results with this little rocket ship to show that it's increasing the accuracy uh when you assign an advantageous role in your role prompting by saying you are an email classification expert uh trained to be the assist this it can increase the accuracy of your prompts and the performance of them by 10.3% and secondly if you give complimentary descriptions of your abilities to further increase accuracy you can get up to 15 to 25% increase in total so this is as simple as here's the example you are a highly skilled in Creative short form content script writer that is the role with a knack for crafting engaging informative and concise videos so you add a role and then you give it key qualities like engaging informative and concise and you basically hype it up and tell it man you're so amazing at this this this so you need have a role that is strong and tells it that is advantageous to what it's doing so if you're solving a math problem you are an expert math teacher and then you can give it some more examples after that of the key quality so takeaways here select the role that is advantageous for the specific task EG math teacher for math problems and then enrich the rooll I like that word enrich the rooll with with additional words to highlight how good it is at that task super simple um that's Ro prompting so this is what we're going to be doing to kind of tie everything together in this video which is a before and after so this was the this was the low IQ one remember this so this is our starting point and here we have what happens after we add in the roll thing so you're going to need to pause this as this thing gets bigger it's kind of hard for me to put the whole prompt on the screen uh but the before and after um you're going to have the r prompt here highlighted and well low lighted in Black uh so you can see what we've changed so here we've still got the task here we've still got the bit before but it's just now part of a Li and pront we have the role included as well you are an experienced email classification system that accurately categorizes emails based on the content and potential business bagged great so task now going back there that's pretty helpful this is actually the task um so the thing that most people actually put into ches or into the prompt is the task itself so it's basically just telling it what it's going to do uh usually starting with a verb we want to say generate a this Analyze This write this but be descriptive as possible while also keeping it brief so an example here is generate engaging and Casual Outreach messages for users looking to promote their services in the dental industry especially focusing on the integration of AI tools to scale businesses your messages should be direct so it's telling it what it should do use a verb nothing too crazy here um but what I will mention is that this is where because we're doing these single shot systems we need to insert values cuz it's going to have our prompt written and then we need to be throwing different like in this case the email content is the variable that we need to put in this place so in this case you see that I have the dental industry as the niche and the pink one here which the integration of tools as the offer um this is from an earlier video that I've done within the task is where you can insert the variables that are going to be used uh throughout the system so if you go back a little bit uh we have the email content variable and you can see here that it's already become part of the task so classify the D here's the variable based input that we want then we have the technique that's associated with the task component um and that is Chain of Thought prompting this is something that's fairly common now and pretty widely known um it involves telling the model to think step by step without our instructions or B yet you can provide it with step-by-step instructions uh for it to work through each time which is my kind of preferred way of doing it so here's the example um we take this script writer example as well um and in this case if you just give it a list of six points so hook the viewer in briefly explain provide one two F standing facts described so we're giving it step-by-step instructions on how it should perform the task and the research results of of thought prompting being incorporated into your prompts it's a 10% accuracy boost on simple problems I me that's like very very simple problems like solve this or 4 plus 2 equals blah BL blah uh but 90% accuracy on complex multi-state problems which is likely what many of you are going to be uh dealing with with the system that you're trying to build so 90% accuracy boost is pretty insane and uh considering you only have to write up a little list of what it should do chain of th promting something you should uh you should really incorporate uh key takeaway here the more complex the problem the more dramatic the Improvement using chain of Thor prompting so that's the task if we go across now you see that we've included a chain of Thor component to the task so the old one which was just the chat GPT uh low IQ person is this and we've added on the roll prompt and we've also added in a section for how it should approach a task a step-by-step Chain of Thought prompting method that we've Incorporated next we have the specific section which is below the task and this is really an addition to the task so to not get it too bloated on the task component you can then have important bullet points that reiterate uh more instructions or important notes regarding the execution of the task so using the example of the Outreach message generator prompt examples of specifics what this might be each message should have an intro body and outro with a tone that's informal use placeholders like this so it's kind of a list of additional points that outside of just the core part of the task you can give additional uh kind of bullet points which is pretty handy uh when you're modifying The Prompt when you're editing it if you think it's not doing something correctly you can just easily add another bullet point on so this is kind of what I will do most of my modification when I'm writing my prompts and the tech associated with specifics is called emotion prompt and this refers to adding short phrases um containing emotional stimuli emotional stimula emotional stimula right to enhance the prom performance so here's the research results emotional stimula can be things like this is very important to my career this task is vital to my career and I really value your thoughtful analysis this continues on from role prompting a bit cuz you're kind of continuing to hype this thing up and say look like you I really appreciate how how good you are at this thing and and you being part of this business and what we're doing is so important and it has massive implications on myself and my business and also on society as a whole the more you can hype it up and tell it that is its task is like the world is going to fall apart if it doesn't do this thing right the better the performance you can get out of it so the research results here are adding emotional stimula which can be as short as these two little phrases here this is very important to my career um and this is vital to my career these little lines here uh increased 8% on simple task and 115% on complex task compared to zero short problem so huge increase on complex tasks which is likely what you're going to be building your problems for anyway and it also enhanced the truthfulness and informativeness of llm outputs by an average of 19 and 12% respectively so not only are you getting the increase in accuracy is is this thing getting the right uh the right output in the right response but also it's more truthful and informative which is me fluffy things but more being more truthful and informative is probably a good thing right so the ROI just adding a few of these words for the performance of your prompt is ridiculous there's no reason you shouldn't be throwing in a couple these emotional kind of lines which is a this is very important like this is such a key thing in the business that you are part of so the key takeaways here adding simple phrases like these can encourage the model to engage in more thorough and deliberate processing which is especially beneficial for your complex tasks that require more careful thought and Analysis so how does this actually add into our prompt we have it below the task section here I can zoom in and we have the specifics this task is critical to the success of our business if the email contains blah blah blah blah and it's just a list of additional instructions and we can throw in that emotion prompt in there as well so that's specifics you can see it's sort of coming together here then we jump into context this is kind of self-explanatory but just giving the model a better idea of the environment in which it's operating in and why can be helpful to increase performance and this also gives us an opportunity to really further instill the role prompting that we did at the start and also the emersion prompting that we've done in the specific so an example here from our email classification system could be our company provides AI solutions to businesses across various Industries but Accord about who the business is we receive a high volume of emails from potential clients through our website contact form Your Role again role prompting we're incorporating again reminding it of the role that it has is classifying this emails is essential emotion prompt for our sales team to prioritize the efforts and respond to inquires inquiries in a timely manner by accurately identifying motion prompt again Etc so you can read the rest of that but we're we're heading up with a ro prompt again we're giving it context on the system that it belongs to and here's here's my general notes I'm getting here to myself but General notes for context is to provide context on the business including the types of customers types Services products values Etc then you can provide context on the system that it is part of as you can see here we're saying this is part of our sales process and we get a lot of emails and then you can provide a little bit of context on the importance of the task and the impact on the business um so you directly contribute to the growth and success of our company therefore we greatly value your careful consideration and attention to classification so just kind of reiterating a lot of the stuff that we've done in the role and also in the uh in the specific section as well here's the before and after we've added this context section section down the bottom uh not rocket science the example section kind of self-explanatory but we want to give examples to the model on how it should perform and and how it should be replying to it so you given input output pairs is what you usually refer to them as um and this goes on to the technique of few shot prompting uh single shot one shot prompting um and in this case we're going to be talking about few shot prompting because that's giving more than one example so uh I'll give you a little bit of a a look into the research results here um now all of these research results attached to Scientific papers that i' I've gone through and and found and and put in here for you so if you want to get access to all of those research papers I'll put it on a figma or put it on in the description so you can have a look at the papers themselves I'm not pulling these out of my ass uh these are coming from papers where people have actually studied these things so um and this graph here shows the effect of adding these input output examples on the performance and accuracy of the prompt so zero shot prompting is on the far left we have 10% accuracy for these 175 billion parameters version of gpt3 as soon as you add one example to this it jumps up from 10 to nearly 50 to 45% accuracy and then we get sort of a a diminishing returns as we continue to increase up to here is 10 examples so this is 10 input output pairs so a QA QA QA one QA and one example of an input and an output that is a a a shock with a one shock prompt we got a 45% accuracy and as we got up to 10 we got a 60% and kind of flattened off after there so the research results uh is that GB3 175 billion parameters achieved an average 14.4% improvement over its zero shot accuracy of 57.4 when using 32 examples per task so that's way up here um and using a lot of them and it kind of crept its way up uh but for us the key takeaways is that providing just a few examples literally going from zero examples to one massively increases the performance compared to zero shot prompting when it doesn't have any examples so accuracy scales with the number of examples but it shows diminishing returns most of the gains can be achieved between uh 10 to 32 well crafted examples and personally I go for like 3 to 5 I don't really want to be sitting there all day writing all these examples and the more examples you give the more tokens you're putting in the input of your prompt and therefore the more expensive it is every time every time you call that prompt so if it's part of this email classification system and we have 32 examples we're going to have 32 examples worth of context and token usage in our Automation and that means every single time an email comes in it's going to be sending off huge amounts of tokens uh as part of the input and going to be charged on those import tokens as well so 10 to 32 is is a sweet spot according to this paper just do 3 to 5 it does a job enough um and at least in my experience and and the stuff that we do at morning side as well so a little bit more on examples I won't bore you too much here but this is kind of the key part here that these guys doing these these uh these papers and doing the research they documented roughly predictable Trends and scaling and performance without using fine tuning so by giving examples you are kind of impr prompt fine-tuning these models uh and people talk about fine tuning and everyone thinks that you need to do it I personally for me and my development company we build these AI solutions for businesses and we've never had to use fine tuning because we're actually good at prpt engineering and there's only a very limited number of use cases where fine shunting actually gives you an advantage um and that's just from our experience so if you want to avoid doing the messy stuff of data collection and fine tuning and all that crap uh just get good at prompting get get good at writing these examples and you can achieve the roughly similar uh performance increases um as fine tuning without fine tuning so this graph here shows an interesting uh bit of data that I do want to share is getting a little bit Ticky but uh this graph on the right here shows a significant increase in performance from zero shot which is the blue to few short completions so if you add in some examples you're going to jump up from I think it was 42 up to nearly 55 60 a big jump immediately just by adding a few examples but interestingly the gold labels here so these orange pillars these orange bars uh that refers to the tests done where the labels were correct so maybe if the email classification was um here's the email here's classification and we gave it correct examples the performance increase within the study was shown regardless of whether those labels were correct so this tells us something interesting that the llm is not strictly learning new information so by giving us giving it few short examples that have the correct labels it's not necessarily learning that information it's actually just learning from the format and structure uh and that helps to increase the accuracy of the outputs overall the accuracy of the label itself does not actually appear to matter too much uh on the on the overall performance so you can have incorrect labels and it's still going to perform just as well um because you've given it some examples on how it should respond so long story short throwing in three to five examples is going to greatly increase the accuracy and the performance of your prompt um and it's also should be thought of more as teaching it how to structure the output so this is very important if you're not getting the structure you want and throwing in a whole bunch of other rubbish like oh well this is the answer to the question if you just give it a few examples of how it should respond it's going to look very closely at that and it's going to perform much better for you so think of it as fine tuning of the St the tone and the length and the structure of the output um and I think this is something that a lot of people miss out on when they don't add these things in because it's it's so important if you just wanted to give you one word and you kind of try to tell it in the task to just give one word responses sure it might listen to it but if you give five examples of input and then just a one word output like in our case opportunity or or needs attention or ignore these labels for our email classification system uh it's going to perform so much better so here's a before and after again we're getting a little bit small here so I'll allow you to pause this on screen as you wish but we've given it a couple examples you can see how I've done it here in this case it's email label um I usually tend to go for a q and a uh that's usually my go-to strategy or input output um but that's that's basically how we do it we go example one uh we give the QA and then we give a space example two some you don't even need to put these on um you can just leave it as that and it sort of figures it out uh but that's that's F shot property and examples and how we've compared them now getting on to the final bit stick with me because you are learning some very good stuff here uh the notes section is the final part and this is our last chance to remind the llm of key aspects of the task and add any final details or tweaks uh this is something that you'll end up using a lot as you're actually doing the prompt engineering workflow um in the list I usually end up having things like output formatting notes like you should put your output in X format or do not do X like if it's doing something as I do a test this is kind of where I'm iterating on the on the prompt so if I if it gives me an output and it has doing something way wrong or just say at the bottom at the note section say do not do X or you are not supposed to do this never include it in your output uh these kind of things are very easy to slap onto the note section at the bottom um small tone tweaks reminders of key points from the task or specifics is really what I use the note section for um and and as I say here it usually starts out quite skinny because if you do the all the prompt incorrectly you'll have well I've got nothing else to say in the prompt all I've got nothing else to say at this bottom section then you give it a spin you throw some inputs at it and it starts doing some wacky stuff and you come back and go oh well this just reminded of some things I've said earlier on and you start to add this list of things to the notes now don't let it become too long u because it's going to start to sort of water it down you'll notice that it'll start forgetting earlier notes if you put too many notes in um but less is more here and if it's it's really just to tweak these outputs to to get the right right kind of responses without refactoring the whole thing and restructuring how you did the task in the specific so it's just kind of a lazy way of tacking things on to just get it nudged towards where you want it to go um now we have the note section and it's based off the Lost in the middle effect which is from another scientific like research paper um and this lost INE middle effect is is most famous kind of for this graph here uh which shows that language models perform best when relevant information is at the very beginning Primacy I'm learning new stuff here as well or end recency of the imput context so performance significantly worsens when the critical information is in the middle of a long context and this effect occurs even when the models are designed for long input sequences so yes gbt 4 32k back in the day was designed for 32,000 tokens but it didn't really listen to anything in the middle um luckily the models that we work with now um are much better at retrieving information over large context um but you should still keep this in mind because it still seems to apply um and this is why the note section is at the end this little graph here basically shows you that uh when you place the information at the start the accuracy is higher and when you place it in the middle the accuracy is lower and when you place it at the end the accuracy is higher but not as high as the start so it really listens to the stuff at the start so the role prompt it takes it very seriously and that's why we have our task up the top as well that's why we have the context in the middle because it's not as important so see he's starting to knit together all this information understand these how all these different uh techniques knitten together so the way that I've structured this prompt and the way my team have structured it I'm going to really re retelling you what we do at morning Side by adding these things all in together uh you see how it starts to fit together into a proper strategy and not just throwing over the wall and having some kind of prompt formula it's actually based off the science um and and if I L to talk about science these days so uh that is lost in the middle I think have a little more here the research results of course that you've been anxiously waiting for is that when a relevant document is at the beginning or the end of a context GPD 345 turbo achieves around 95 around 75% accuracy on a QA task um an increase of 20 to 25% compared to when the document was placed in the middle um so the key takeaways from this is instructions given at the start and the end of The Prompt are listened to by the LM far more than anything in the middle um for this reason the note section is a handy to append reminders uh for anything that happened in the task or the specifics that you notice it maybe isn't listening to and you need to reiterate um but be aware that increasing the context length alone does not ensure better performance still having less context or fluff will mean the remaining instructions are more likely to be followed so while lost in the middle refers to okay where should we put where should we structure the prompt to include uh the right information to be listen what's the most important thing in the prompt and where should we put it yes that does that but it also it also gives us information on how we should try to keep our prompt as short as possible because it's over longer context periods that these things start to get bad so the shorter you can keep the prompt in general it could listen to the whole thing very very well but as soon as you've like really made it bloated um it's going to be losing some of that stuff in the middle so less is more um and having less less fluff is always going to make your your prods perform better so here you can see in the note section uh please provide the email classification label and only the label as your response so again reiterating the format we want the output to be in um do not include any personal information in your response if you're unsure uh on the side of caution and assign the needs attenti label so little reminders as we've gone through and and we tweaking this email classification prompt you will add those things at over time so getting back to this little diagram here we have the role prompting covered off you know how to use that technique is tell it a roll and and tell it how good it is at that role Chain of Thought give it a list of things that it should do and how it should break down the the task motion prompt tell it how good it is tell it how important everything is that it's doing few shot prompting give it examples that it knows the kind of output format you want lost in the middle kind of tells you how to structure everything and where to put the right information and you can add on a couple little uh things at the bottom so that it really listens to them at the end and finally here we have markdown formatting man I'm talking at a mile here and I'm getting really hot anyway markdown formatting is kind of the final piece of this puzzle and tied all together and I learned this from a CTO Spencer he put me onto this technique and I use it all the time now so uh markdown formatting is a way that we can structure our prompts um for both our sake so that it's more readable CU When you write these large prompts it can get a little bit and like there's a lot of stuff going on so for our sake it allows us to structure the reprompt better but also it allows the llm to understand the structure a little bit better as well while I don't have any research to back that up uh my only data on why we should be doing this and why it may perform better is because you can see over here uh someone managed to extract out the system prompt from th 3 within chat GPT and open AI themselves are actually using uh using these the smart formatting so you can see uh a pound symbol here and then tool so these are marked out headings as we're going to go into in a second but if open AI is using it um to train their systems and to to prob their own systems we should probably be using it as well which is kind of why we're doing it here so uh basically markdown gives us a few new tools to structure um you may notice if you're writing a prompt you just got PL text you don't have any any method to to Signal what a hitting would look like or what bulb would look like but markdown gives us uh those those techniques so we have hittings uh hitting one is the largest hitting two is the second lest hting three is the third lest so you have now different layers of hittings so you can have like roll task all these in the hitting one so just H one as a as a pound symbol and then and then a space and then whatever you want after it which you'll see in a sign um but then if you have little subsets or subsections like examples hitter and then you want example one you can have example one as a hitting three or a hitting two so you have different layers of hitting and importance uh you also have bolds italics underlines list horizontal rules and more so if you want to jump into the fancy stuff I'll teach you the basics here of markdown but you can also do these other things I'm not sure what the effectiveness is um of bolds and italics and stuff but I tend to just use the use the headings as a as a structure tool so key takeaways on markdown formatting is use these H1 tags single pound symbol uh to Mark each of the components for your prompt and then you can use the H2 or three tags or even bolds and stuff to sort of add add additional additional structure to other parts of it so here's example of how you should add it in hitting one roll hitting one task specifics context and then Within context I've added in here look you might want to break the context into subsections of okay let's use a heading 2 and go about the business about our system so you don't need to do that all the time but this is how you can start to use other types of headings in like H2 or H3 tags to to split up uh some of the other subsections under each of your main headings and then again examples we can have an example one as a as a heading three and give the examples and the notes so that's roughly and you come in here and obviously you are a BL blah um generate BL BL blah you get what I'm doing you get what I'm saying and so what this all looks like when we tie it together um we now have our completed prompt which this is the before remember this is where we started this is the uh the the the super guy who doesn't not had a prompt this is what we started with and this is what we have after when we apply all of these techniques now this is a little bit overol for an email classification system but what I want to show you is that this is how you would apply it to a simple task like this so we have the roll that's wrapped in the AG one tag we have H1 tag here Etc um and we have all of these different components role task specifics context examples and notes all integrating the uh techniques that we've been over in this video and now stacking up all of the increases in accuracy that we get from these different techniques we can see that we don't know how much markdown formatting gives us uh but the total is potentially above 300% increase in accuracy then the final step here is we can add up all of the different increases and and the performance increases that we get from these techniques and we can can sum it up to a 300% or more increase in in performance so me you can listen to me or you can just ignore it or you can use these place by Place wherever you think you need it um but considering emotion prompting is literally just a few words saying you're the best and this is really important to me and Ro prompting is like one or two lines and lost in the middle is really just more of a an understanding of where to put the right information you prompt you've now got a toolkit and going back to this guy over here look at this guy he's got a toolkit he understands the science understands from research papers at why these things work the way they do and because he has this this deeper understanding of what makes llms do the right things that they want them to do he's better able to perform and as you can see he is on the upper end of the spectrum here so this is the guy that you should be now all you need to do is take these and apply it and you'll start to see and and connect them go okay okay so lost in the middle um that's not doing what I want maybe I need to change the stuff at the start and the end okay uh it's giving me the wrong structure and style okay maybe maybe I give some more F short examples of how it should be responding and I I take my time and I write them carefully and I tell them the kind of style and structure of the response I want it's really not rocket science and people have already done the hard work by doing the the research to get these kind of results so um to wrap up this video I've given oh actually we have a considerations page here uh context length and costs as I mentioned earlier for high volume tasks um like this example of email classification system uh I guess it's not too high volume but if this thing is doing like 50 50 100 reps a day it's really being put through the ringer and there's a lot of volume going through the task that you're building you need to focus on making that prompt as short and succinct as possible uh because every time you run it you are charged for the input and the output tokens so while you may only be outputting a label in this case of just needs needs work new opportunity or needs attention or ignore you're also charged for the input tokens as well so all the prop that you put in you're going to be charged for plus the inserted variables as well so you've got the prompt then you're inserting the email context you're getting all of that information and that over you're you're going to get charged on that so uh keep in mind that if you're doing a lot of volume try to use a a cheaper model as we're going into next but also keep the The Prompt shorter as well the choice of model is important as well better prompt engineering and the skills that I've just taught you on this going back to this guy here he has better prompt engineering skills and can get better performance out of Cheaper models this guy doesn't have the skills so he relies on the more expensive and slower models which are not good for the client um to get the performance that he needs because he doesn't have the skills to get it to do what he wants and that brings me back to this choice at model point which is where possible you need to use your skills and use your advantage to bend the cheapest and fastest model to execute the task successfully so 3.5 turbo is basically free like this thing open AI has made that so cheap and whatever whenever you're watching this video might be different but the cheapest fastest model should be your goto and if you can't get it working there then you can go up but you have the skills now um if it has high volume and requires fast responses this is when your skills will shine because you can create prompts that do and perform um fast and cheap then we have the temperature and and other model settings if you're doing creative rating adiation Etc then test higher levels so 0.5 to1 uh but anything else if you're putting systems like this whereas classification or AI is kind of doing a a a fixed piece of the of the puzzle uh you want it to be on zero just have that we're trying to fight against the inconsistency and and natural randomness of these models and in order to do that we need to uh set that temperature to zero and that's going to make the system a lot more consistent uh so zero is what I typically use for basically anything apart from creative writing cutter uh script rting prompts the other and the other model settings like frequency penalty and top PE are not needed in my experience just play around with the the temperature that's all you need to worry about what I'm going to jump to now is actually having a chat with my CTO Spencer um and he's going to share what we've done at morning side on one of our projects where we had to go from GPT 4 uh which was doing the job great and then the client wanted to change to GPT 3.5 turbo to save money and then we had to kind of rebuild everything in order to get it working so uh we're going to jump to that and you get to here for Spencer again lot smarter than me and a lot of the stuff that I'm sharing actually came from what he's learned uh learned on the job and what he does at warning side so everyone if you haven't met Spencer already this Spencer my CTO he's a lot smarter than I so I'm bringing him on to chip into this prompt engineering video just briefly because um a lot of the stuff that I've just told you about has actually come from has big brain here he's been sharing a lot of the the research papers particularly within our slack across the companies we're on the same page so Spencer I wanted to bring you on here particularly because we've been working with a one of our biggest clients ever today U and I want to particular focus on how I was talking in this video about the pr engineering skills allowing you to get more out of uh lesser and cheaper models um and how we've had to switch from a gbg4 based SAS that we built over to a hbt 3.5 turbo and and the difficulties in transitioning that so if you just want to um give any notes on the on the presentation prior but also specifically on uh getting more out of these these lesson models really which is what I'm trying to teach people in this video yeah yeah definitely so um yeah it's an interesting one I usually uh like to try and break things down so um when going through these path the key is is that obviously want to use the cheaper models first so 3.5 comes comes first to mind um in this case specifically for this client there's a lot of complex uh kind of information that they were synthesizing out of it so we made the decision to start off with gp4 um to to make sure that we were getting the responses that we wanted now once it kind of got closer to uh to release there we realized that the the cost that was Associated um with running these models is going to be ative so we had to yeah kind of take that transition now and and gauge down to 3.5 so whenever I'm doing that specific task the key one that I'm looking at is yes prompt engineering one um and then two is scope reduction um gp4 is really good at a bunch of different things uh and and understanding kind of the hidden context that uh that's in the words that you're doing uh 3.5 is is much less so so um you almost want to break it down into smaller kind of component size chunks for the task um and then use those as kind of contributive to to get the same results as you would with four um so that was the steps that we're taking in this particular project another good tactic to use as well and and one that I would highly recommend is using gp4 first and then taking the input and output pairings as training data to fine-tune a 3.5 model as well um because we found that that's that's really helpful uh for getting your cost down but keeping up that GPT for L quality yeah I'm kind of just bashed fine tuning earlier in this video because I say it's it's unnecessary in almost every case um so I mean using few short examples is essentially a way of of fine tuning VI prompting so if you just give a few short examples of gp4 outputs or human rid outputs would that not do a lot in terms of getting more towards the outputs that you're looking for yeah 100% and you're completely right on that one fine tuning for I would say a vast amount of use cases isn't really NE necessary you can get I would say 90 even 95% of the way with uh with just good old fashioned prompt engineering and and F shot prompt in here um with f shot prompting there's a interesting paper that came out last year um and I can't remember the specific name of it but uh it talks about the decision boundary so there's an important uh kind of lesson to learn on that is that for the fot prompts that you're giving the important part is to give ones that are confusing to the model itself so the ones that you notice that it's getting wrong consistently if you actually categorize those and take those in and take the one to five artist examples that you get and then use those as the uh yeah as the examples in there you'll actually get a lot of better results coming out of your model too well that's that's I'm learning something on this on this call in this video as well because uh I mean I'd always start in my fut show examples have kind of like the most common ones you might check a a curve B in there as well but I just kind of put the five three to five common ones um but knowing that we should try to figure out when it's stuffing up and then and put those on next examples is great so any other notes you have on on the content just Tak a look at the presentation but the markdown formatting aspect um any of the other any other techniques I know motion promps than you want for me so anything that you got there yeah uh markdown is one that we use extensively um I'm a huge ner so I I like writing in markdown anyways just because most of the the notebooks uh Jupiter notebooks if there's any other uh data nerds out there like myself um so it's it's rather um yeah consistent familiar for myself is is any data or or papers that you've seen with the uh the markdown base because in the presentation just before I was like look I I can't find any research papers but I'm sure just probably G on but uh it's more like if open AI using it you'd be pretty stupid not to do it and even just functionally for us as as writing these prompts it's so much more useful to at least have some kind of structure to it so purely on our side you'd use it regardless just to make it easier on your on your end yeah absolutely so I definitely remember reading I think at least a couple papers about structured uh structured inputs in markdown format and there's other ones as well that you can use um but even intuitively so when they're doing the fine-tuning or fine tuning in terms of uh uh reinforcement learning with human feedback rlf um what they're doing is they're actually providing markdown based formatting and that's how they're structuring these prompts that they're giving to it in order to fing it so intuitively of course if it's seen it more it's going to do better when it sees more of the same that it's been trained off um the cool part about using markdown as well is you get to actually use semantic information so if you're writing a Word document if you want to put bold in there if you want to put something in italics titles subtitles all these things it makes it into a much more structured format and that Nuance comes through on the other side to be able to uh yeah make better better prompts to to get better outputs the other one that uh I would suggest as well is they like small little things so uh being very encouraging towards uh an llm can help so uh I usually start off with you're a world class X and you know you are an absolute star doing this it seems a little bit ridiculous at the time that I'm not getting this positive feedback to a machine but uh very helpful um the other one's telling the model to take a deep breath and to think it through step by step before responding I'm 100% serious has been proven to actually increase the quality of your responses and that also doubles as a as a great one when you're significant other as is angry usually that yeah yeah I would not suggest that as a as a I'll be honest follow the chcken by calm down anyway it's good you mention that sorry that the the hype in the model up I talked about this just earlier in the video is that look this a motion prompt thing where you can get I think 115% increase in your in your accuracy it's just by being like wow you well firstly on the role prompting being like wow you are like the best at this and then providing enriching it with additional words to to reinforce like how good it is at that toas and then the other I think so um let M anyway back to what you said yeah I and it's actually funny as well Persona based uh thing so if you uh not only tell it it's a world class X if you actually use names of specific people especially people who have written over the Internet or uh you know if you say you are Albert Einstein it will actually come out with higher quality outputs um that are very much in the style of writing the the person that you're talking about I use it for programming personalities so Theo he he does the T3 stack um and I'll constantly say you're Theo show me how to refactor my code like the wood and and that actually goes really really well um and then the other kind of last one in here is on the positivity rout but not using negative uh feedback for so a lot of the time your your first impulse is going to be like stop doing this don't do this don't do that if you instead focus on do this or do that um the negative conent uh words actually are associated with worse outcomes than positively France yeah it's just interesting because then the in the research for this and I was trying to put together okay like negative prompting is this a real thing it seems like the consensus is that it doesn't actually uh do much but I will I've anecdotally the contrary which is uh if if it's doing something incorrectly I'll usually just put at the very bottom in the notes section just never do this in your output and it usually tends to work so I mean there's both sides there it works for me sometimes but it's probably something a lack of my skills as well um that I should be doing it further up but yeah there's some really good things I think if you guys can as B said that's another GM that I'll be I'll be incorporating into my prompting is giving it a name giving the rle a name um and that's something OB you just say you're an expert this this this um but if you have an example of a real person or that someone that the internet would have had information about um you can throw that in there as well yeah absolutely um yeah I think those are the the big topl line ones for me at least right yeah no that's really helpful again this is why I brought Spencer on even I've I've learned something here um but yeah we can jump back to the video thank you Spencer thanks so much then so I hope that's drilled in the importance of PR engineering and and being able to use these cheaper and faster models to achieve the outcomes that your clients want otherwise you're not going to make any money uh but going back to to this I just want to say look everything that I've just taught you here can be applied to all these different types of systems and what I want to leave you off with at the end of this is examples of things so an AI agent is is like GPT is are a good example of this um or the building AI agents on my own platform in my own software agentive if you want to check it out we're only on weight list at the moment so you can check that out in the description uh but agentive allows you to build AI agents as does the gbt Builder on on the chb site but what we want to do if we modifying this prompt formula for this use case of AI agents is to modify to include how to use the knowledge how to use the tools and your answer then you can provide examples of response styes and Toad so you can pause that take a look see but here most important things to point out is that I've added in U so you can see roll task specifics and then tools so the tools here if you are adding custom tools into your uh into your gpts or into your AI agents you can add a little section uh using the same kind of format right we have a heading and say you have two tools to use one I like to include the knowledge base if I've added any knowledge to my AI agent I'll sell tell it use the knowledge base because it's actually that's how it's working they use it as a knowledge based tool they just don't already tell you that it's a it's a tool um so you construct it knowledge base is one of the tools you have you can use it when you're answering AI business related questions and number two is a coine similarity tool it could be other tool that's calling relevance or something uh but tell it how to use each of the tools that's involved and then examples of okay here's a question someone ask the agent here's how you should respond uh Etc so not not rocket science you guys can use that uh but that's how I write my adapt this formula to do AI agent prompts and it works really well next is voice agents you need to modify the prompt formula to include a script outline if necessary uh so sylow BL AI air all these things that are popping off right now uh you can modify the same prompt template uh to do uh really good voice agents for you so role task but in the task here we're giving you an outline of how it should talk and the steps involved uh then we have the specifics then we have context about the business uh this is an example for a restaurant um I'm just giving a bit of context on the restaurant there then we have examples of how it should respond to the most common questions as I said before you can also come in here and add in a script section and add in like a rough outline of how the script would go but I've kind of included that in this uh in this in in this section here from a high level at least so voice agents same sort of thing modify it to to do the job then we have ai automations which can be using zapia make air table air table now has AI which is cool uh but you can create powerful AI tasks and businesses they can be relied upon to handle thousands of operations a month uh what we just built in the email classifier is an example of an automation so I don't really need to go over this but here's another example at the end here you can see sometimes I like to throw this in um is after I've given examples at the bottom I'll go q and then I'll put the constraint in or in this case the variable uh in again and then I'll leave the a open up put space and then it's just going to kind of autofill that and it's a it's another technique you can use to to get it to only output uh the exact kind of uh output style that you want so feel free to use that as you need AI tools um you may not know what I mean by tools but basically we can set up a bunch of inputs say Okay Niche offer then we can insert that into a uh into a into pre-written prompt and then that's going to be allowed to connect to either gpts or you can build it um on on a on a landing page and it can be used to speed up workflows so there's so many different ways you can use it um here's an example again you can pause that this an example um here you can see I'm inserting the variables uh we have lots of input output Pairs and then I'm screaming at the end here because because it wasn't do what I wanted so uh yeah take those I'll I'll leave a link to this presentation down on uh I think it'll be on my school community so you just find this video um there'll be a a resource for this thing in the YouTube Tab and you can find this video pull this up and then and use this as you wish so I want to bring you back to this um here's a lollipop um because you get a lollipop for now completing this course and you're now a successful and a a genius level I'm not even sure what this guy's supposed to his name is supposed to be but he looks like a genius to me he looks like a Jedi or something cool so you now this guy and you didn't end up being stuck in this uh this midb territory so here's your little lop and I'm proud of you for getting through this because the skills that I just taught you as I say affect every different thing you're trying to sell in this AI space if you don't have this nailed um you're not going to be able to build things and you're not going to create value for your clients cuz you're going to have to use even if you're kind of okay but you can't get the cheaper model to do what you need it to do then you're not going to be able to succeed long term and I mean you put yourself up if if someone was offering the same AI service and you said Hey look it's going to cost you this much month and it's going to take 10 seconds to respond and some other guy goes okay it's going to cost you one1 of that and it's going to take a quarter of the time um who's going to win there so as as much PVP there's not much PVP going on in the space right now because there's very few people selling selling a Solutions at agencies so we're still very early to it but over time if you don't have these skills you're going to get wiped out by people who do um and yeah keep in mind there's so much potential to be squeezed out of these prompts and out of the these models if you just apply this technique so every 300% increase I'm going to be making a couple more of these Style videos if you did like this if you like me being a lot more uh no and just telling you outs then let me know in the comments because I much prefer doing these kind of videos even though I'm now getting super hot and ready and my cats here but I've like making this personally it's a lot more fun than my normal videos where but uh yeah you get the idea if you've enjoyed please let me know down below and uh subscribe to the channel if you haven't already I'm probably going to have a couple more videos like this on core things that I think you need to understand because if you don't learn this then you can't use my sass and I can't make money so I'm very selfishly teaching you this stuff so that one day you can use my sass and I can sell my sass for hundreds of millions of dollars so forgive me for being selfish but you get to win along the way um but yeah see you in the next one"

listen to music just so my brain gets fully out of the the kind of loops and habits I was in so highly recommended Mark Andrew and stuff mean he's like the father of the web in many ways so uh pretty cool highly recommend [Music] were each so we got a bit of a different video today I'll uh I've just arrived in Amsterdam here for a bit of a day in the life kind of weekend in the life I think of uh we're doing our first accelerator Meetup for members of my accelerator very last minute it was kind of put together last week so uh we've got about 30 people flying in from all over the world oh lighing is pretty bad there got 30 people flying in from around the world to catch up and do iners Meetup of uh AI agency owner so I'm uh super excited just flown on a pretty nasty 4:00 a.m. wake up from Dubai um flight got delayed not IDE deal um but uh we're here now it is uh 400 p.m. uh Amsterdam Central European Time so I'm going to trundle over to the hotel now get ready and I think I need to be at the event we're going on a canal boat at 600 p.m. so I need to get the stuff moving quickly uh but yeah that's where I'm at damn okay been out way inut minute oh oh I think the uh last time I was here was a year and a half ago maybe even more we've come here quite a lot with my uh my team my business partner he loves being here um and actually one of our team from morning side a guy from New Zealand who now works for us he lives in in Amsterdam he's recently moved here and my assistant Nina lives here as well so this is very much a a hub for us in the outside of Dubai I met Nina my assistant when I was 21 traveling around with one of my other teammates Casey uh we're traving around and met her in Italy in sento and thef coast and we're drinking all those booze with her and new friends um and then all these years later I end up hiring her as my assistant so uh having seen her since then in person so it'll be interesting to catch up with her she's been uh absolutely key in in getting this whole thing organized cuz she lives here obviously so no pressure for her and a good chunk of the New Zealand guys that I've I've hired to come on and work at morning side with me um and with then the accelerator going to be there so uh it's going to be nice to see my friends and my brothers again really that's what they are um yeah happy to be out look at it Greenery Greenery bit of nature bit of uh European culture can't go wrong they just do things well over here you know I'm seriously running out of time at it's nearly 5:00 I have to leave the hotel at 6 of course I'm late and it's not even my fault this time but um yeah if you guys are if you guys don't know me person I'm always late to everything but this time it was a plane spot not mine um so I'm blaming emirats but yeah you're too you're to all right this be I thought some hog assv going on [Music] here all right so about to go see the boys and the girls I think think they're he in the bar this is exciting cuz we have uh the morning side team meeting some of our guys for the first time so Mato is here our product owner for agentive and for some of our client builds so see you where they yeah likewise s I'm getting the whole Vlog FR was yeah smart but I'm the host you know you should have known I wasn't going to manager owner at James developer I've got it's good to be back in [ __ ] yeah it's good to see you again hello it a true buzy this has come a long way since June man [ __ ] away this is uh I'm I'm doing this as part of a vlog for the channel so tell here come all the way from Canada how was the flight it was long but it was 100% worth than that I'm here did you get any delays I was delayed 3 hours mate no really that wasn't good was good were you in uh you in MA by off was as hell cuz I mean we're big guys and like literally a problem prob fought with one dude almost f one dude yeah I mean if there you and Mark squeezed into a ky seat next to some other D but we made it through we made it through we're here and uh this is actually I was talking to to Li actually the other about how much how much this has changed since we joined remember last year back in June how look at these people are here you did s in until I saw how many people I just like out this by the way guys come here boom I get F each time that you're near oh this F go it's you that I fear darling you make me high and I adore of course of course of course my my colle okay byebye hell all right that's uh about first half of the evening done was success it's kind of cold now but um off to a bar and uh call it a night yeah successful good to meet a lot of people in person say hi to them and uh get to know more about the businesses and what they're doing what's up guys we here in dorf uh my friends and uh business partners are all living here for the next couple of months and I wanted to come down here and do a little bit of strategy with them um and I was going to go stay in my usual spot in D which is the high which is really nice of tell uh love staying there but I realized that uh my friend Casey here has his own little apartment um and so I thought I'm going to come in and uh stay with him for a bit so here's Josh it's Casey I'll take you on a little house tour casy keeping the place nice and clean oh it is quite nice out here to be fair on a big day it's a little bit of a mess bro yeah does the job so it's been good here last couple days uh really working on strategy for Education morning side side and an agentive So today we're doing a little more on the war side side of things and Cas just up the camera and we have just constant figma boards fig boards if you're not using them you need to use them more cuz uh mapping things out when you don't have a whiteboard is really key uh and we're going to do a bit of work now on uh on the strategy side um School post Thursday Sunday uh one of those needs to be obviously on that meet up salt 997 onm so those four things for you pretty much for Sunday all good uh I need to prepare we've got that big proposal that one you're on that sales called the other day for morning side uh so preparing that 997 Swit and getting all that sort of on the site Ollie at sales calls for that morning sat our marketing plan I think uh we can start to put out some content there especially just to [ __ ] solidify that a little bit so getting that taken care of get a exact list of Education task before relaunch I think that's another one like really dep and yeah I think with the two videos uh the newsletter should just be byproducts of the videos I don't need to like reate the wheel every time I can just if I have something I've constructed into a framework that I sh the video I can just expand on that the new different [Music] Ang hey long road you can tumble down this black hole stuck in Sunday Le but I'm on levels with now though a legend in the making as a kid I dreamed on alone we feel cracks of broken homes with broken dreams and broken bones so yeah that's the end of the time with the boys uh as you can see you might have had it in the end I'm not sure but there's a lot of talk we have about the inefficiency of being not together and there's the times that myself my my friends I mean I'm so lucky to have five or six guys from New Zealand that all all work for me now and and work with me to uh be when we're living together we get so much more done we make so much more money the impact on our successes is far greater um and right now I'm in Dubai Josh is here with his girlfriend in dorf uh Casey's now living here not living with them but living in the same city and then my creative director Shan is in barley and then my friend Daniel is in Romania and one of our other developers is is is in Amsterdam uh half our team's in Canada uh not entirely sure if we we being optimal here um but there's things that if you get into this life and you do end up being able to travel and literally live wherever you want which is a pretty cool thing to have you realize it's kind of it's kind of catch to it which is now that you can live wherever you want how do you structure it in a way that optimizes for the most happiness or not even not happiness but whatever you want to optimize for how do you set up a life that consist of probably multiple different places once the tax issues there what's the residency how are you going to find friends there do you need friends what about your love life uh how much Focus can you get there is it very distracting there's so many factors that go into it and we're still trying to kind of figure out what we do as a group to find that optimal balance for us in our own lives you can do it so many different ways of course but uh yeah I think we have another couple months of really grinding out in our own little kingdoms before we before we link up and uh move back to New Zealand for 6 months it's likely going to be the plan um our plan changes every couple of weeks so take that with a greatest s but going back to New Zealand and having some kind of Base there for 6 months um before we head out and do sort of traveling around that so I would like that I think I'm sick of jumping around not even jumping around but I'm sick of living in a place like Dubai to some degree um as much as I I love Focus but uh I want to be with my boys and my boys don't really want to be in Dubai so if it's I got to I got to give up and if they got a bit of plan which is going to New Zealand I'm I'm all for it so I think my uh my days are numbered in in Dubai over the long term um but for the time being until we can get the business where we want to be um I do need to sacrifice my urges to move somewhere more socialable or or green or whatever I don't know still figuring it out as you can tell yeah I don't want to drag this on too long it's been my first video like this so I hope you guys have enjoyed I hope you see a little bit more about what makes me take the stuff that I get excited for the cool stuff that's happening in the space uh whether you're on board or not whether you're a hater whether you love my stuff you love what we're doing you can see very tangibly by the stuff that was happening over this weekend is that people are on this opportunity and we do have amazing Community that's only growing so I'm uh incredibly honored and and grateful for my role in all this and being able to be someone who attracts such awesome people to to an opportunity uh and I'm going to continue to keep doing what my team and and myself can do best to continue to grow that so if you like this style and you want to see more like this um let me know down below I know it's very different um but this is likely something I'll be doing a bit more often uh cuz I've got a pretty cool thing going on and I'm very I'd love to share more of it and I think a lot of you would benefit from seeing what it's what I do and uh and and what it takes What It Takes I mean I suppose it would be you may not even be surprised but what it what the reality of of doing this thing full-time and and living and breathing as AI versus thing looks like so let me know down below and uh yeah thanks for watching we see you in the next we had Italy on the water me and Street recording SM weed SM dop Dr a little L I actually did good I ain't drink but a paint this whole tour yeah on tour I miss my son birthday it's on July the 15th I lowkey like really see people R past on boats right now doing though just just how sweet saying that Ma you well going to get some sleep got interview with zap's h at AI today so I need to have a couple hour sleep so that I'm not super tired on that as you can tell I'm kind of a bit blasted but uh yeah going to rest up and then get back to it that's been the Vlog um let me know if you liked it you won't hold this but I got to go to bed bye"

              "text": "over the past 12 months I've gone from tinkering with AI systems in my spare time to becoming a CEO of an AI startup with teams of developers and admin staff whose livelihood depends on me so this has been quite a jump for me as a 23-year-old who's up until recently been used to working on fairly independent project just my own kind of thing my e-commerce source and things like this so and recognizing recently that the stakes for me are a lot higher I've decided this year to grow up in a number of ways cutting back on my drinking and partying settling down here in Dubai for more than a few weeks at a time so that I can get into some Rhythm and really let things compound over time and finally the the interesting one for this video in particular is trying to be more respons with my finances prior to this year I've never bothered to track my spending or expenses because I I sort as requiring a whole lot of energy that could have been better invested and actually making more money so I didn't have to worry about how much I was spending in the first place so I thought why would I worry about trying to conserve when I could grow my way out of my problem rather than conserve my way out of it if you get what I mean but this will changed when last year I hired my assistant Nina and I now had the means to track my expenses without eating a Chun of my time each week so over the past few months Dina has been helping me to sort organize categorize my expenses and spending so that I have a finger on the pulse of how much money I'm spending each month but the system we're currently using is definitely not the best it's pretty clunky to say the least so in this video I'll be taking you through how I've sort of revolutionized and streamlined the system that we're using that's saving her a ton of time per week and allowing her to work on more important things the most important part of this build is a GPT Vision integration which is kind of what I want to highlight for you in this build and that you can start building these projects and integrating GPT Vision into your builds for personal use as I'm doing or into your client projects as well using a super simple method that I found to integrate Vision capabilities into your AI solution Nina sorry to be interrupting your day but I figured we need to get a little bit of your side of the story on this um you want to walk through the expenses process and kind of how we got here and how frequently we do it and the worst Parts about it um so that we get a full idea of all the system is right now okay so normally you just send me a screenshot of all your expenses for the past weeks and then I just go through them and I kind of you know have my own prompt that I put into chat GPT but I also do it manually sometimes if I notice that it's not correct or there's a lot of errors it's a really tedious process to be honest it takes around 2 hours at the minimum if I'm really swinging through it I didn't even know it took that long I thought it was take you like I come on the sco thinking that you were going to say 30 minutes 2 hours yeah two hours I mean cuz of course I have to backtrack check them yes gosh okay I mean this video just became a whole lot more important than I thought it was going to be so 2 hours and there's also me just dragging the pick and and not sending them over when I when you ask me to so it's funny even just me screenshotting them and sending them to S black that's difficult for me to do sometimes when I have to squee so well can you just walk us through there a little more cuz there's one bit in there are you still using the like you sending them to your pH they extracting the information out of it that way were you doing on your um I'm sending it to my phone but I think I think most people can probably just do it on their Mac um and then I just kind of add them to a notes page and then I go through them just kind of space them out nicely uh and then I enter them in in future if there if I give you a task that's this inefficient can you please tell me that it's taking you two hours cuz I should have I should have come up with a system for this a long time ago so good news is that i' I've something pretty cool and uh I can give you a little demo of that now so here's a visual representation of the system we're currently running firstly the bank is going to be sending an automated SMS to me every time a transaction goes through my credit card or my accounts or my debit card Etc so any transactions all being centered onto my SMS and coming through as a text message so this is kind of Handy for me not all banks do this um but instead of taking my transactions at the end of the month I'm able to just get them from screenshots so first step of the human involvement of the system is to screenshot my weekly transactions So currently uh what I will do is screenshot these and and need will ask me hey can you send me your expenses for the week I'll then screenshot them and sort of block out up to the past 7 days send them over to and then she would have to use the iOS or Mac OS OCR that you might notice sometimes if you have an updated Mac or or iPhone there's a little button down the corner that allows you to select text out of the image and so I told her to use this and copy the text over the chat GPT use a prompt that had written to categorize it and give it out in a nice format like this like here's the day here's the next day here's the category here's the charge Etc and then she was taking that information and going over to my notion and setting it up manually and putting in each of the rows so not super efficient and as you can tell it was taking up quite a lot of time for her but the new system which I'm about to take you through is a little bit different and it takes out a significant part of the human involvement here and strips it down to a largely automated process using GPT Vision so same as usual Bank sends their SMS to me I'm going to be screenshotting the weekly transactions I'll still send them to Nina um and then she'll be able to send them to the WhatsApp number I mean I could do these myself as you'll see later on but I think it's still good for me to not have to be going through the WhatsApp number and then managing it I'm I think she can go and and set it up herself so what she's able to do with the system I've created is send those screenshots to the WhatsApp number then going to be using GPT Vision via a voice flow chatbot build that integrates GPT Vision with a super easy integration which is really the key of this build is voice flow to Whatsapp but also integrating non-text inputs into your WhatsApp build so as I see here the magic really happens with this step so it's going to be extracting from the screenshots all of the different transactions and putting them into a Json object that we're then able to send to make.com and I've set up a fairly simple automation on make and it's taking all the data from GPT vision and then one by one adding them to my notion database which is going to be displayed on a chart so whether you're interested in managing your finances in a similar way to this or you're more interested in how you can get GPT vision and WhatsApp GPT Vision enabled chat bot that you can sell this video is going to be very interesting for you this chat's been built on voice flow fairly simple build nothing too complex a couple buttons then we have the GPT version step which I'll be going into in a sec but just so you have an idea nothing too fancy here lot of gigantic canvas that we've used here um but I'll show you what it looks like on WhatsApp which is probably more important here I can say hi trigger the assistant hi know what can I help you with I'd like to log expenses upload a screenshot he going to ask me if it has a date it's the top one does at 23 of March now the GPT Vision step is extracting the information as you can see here we have all of the transaction data that we want to be carrying across then we can go continue it's going to add those to notion now and that's all she needs to do have a look over here on my notion and we can see the expenses here added in the Amazon duy taxi and out transfer so that's how easy it is for Nita to upload these now I'll give you a bit more of a breakdown on how we've built this thing with voice flow a basic main menu here that have kind of earmarked some future features that I could build into this if it's going to be an assistant for my assistant to try replace my assistant or at least augment Nina to be more productive and be able to do more things may be logging expenses as one as we've shown here reordering my food checking for flights checking my inbox for important tasks these are all features that I can build in over time using similar AI system WhatsApp chat BS like this can be a really solid base for having a couple options like this for businesses or for personal use long story short we're taking in the image converting it to an image URL and then we're sending that image URL off to the open AI Vision a pi and in order to do this through WhatsApp and and to process it within voice flow we're using a voice flow custom function created by the flowbridge team flowbridge is a platform created by members in our own Community to deploy your voice FL agents to meta Platforms in minutes so this is really the key of this build which is allowed me to easily put my voice FL chatbot onto WhatsApp but also to accept non-text inputs like images and handle it through their custom function so this is actually a platform that's made by three guys from our own community so shout out to the frobish team it's been awesome working with you all this is not a sponsored mention but I'm more than happy to be mentioning the awesome work that you guys are doing over there so if you want to get your voice CL chatbot onto Instagram onto Facebook Messenger or onto WhatsApp uh this is the way to go if you don't want to use the custom API things that voice offers so super helpful uh these guys are going to help you out in anything you need as well cuz they're super responsive on support as they have been with me throughout this build so the flowbridge team has created this custom function luckily you don't have to write anything in here I've done a little bit of custom prompting just to make sure it's extracting the right information that I want but this is available through a link that I'll leave in the description you can add this into any of your voice FL project if you want to be able to interact with the open AI Vision API and to be able to take in image inputs in your WhatsApp chat bot and things like that and not only do they have a function for image inputs like this they also allow voice inputs through WhatsApp as well so they have a special function for that too so I'll leave links to both these down in the description so if you want to check those out they'll be available there once the vision API has taken our image URL and pulled that information off the image we're then going to be sending it off to make.com and over here you can see I have a little scenario cooked up which is based off a whip hook I'm then going to be passing the Json into a format we can use and then basically I'm just iterating over all the different transactions you can see that the webook gets these transactions like this and then we convert it into Json over here this post request here is sending the information from the vision API output to this web hook and this webook is receiving them like this and then we're basically just looping through each one of these so each one of these is a transaction we want each of these to become a row on notion so using the name the date the amount and the category that we've been given by our categorization system with vision API and this is just a case of looping over each of those transactions until all of them have been added into notion and the final step was once I built this chat button and I was happy with the functionality I said okay now I need to try and put this onto my WhatsApp chatbot so that I can give a number to Nina for her to be able to ask questions to and and use rather than trying to use some kind of web chatbot or something like that I wanted it to be on WhatsApp so she just had a number could send the message send the screenshots and it'd be all done like that I was able to do this integration between voice flow and WhatsApp with flowbridge as I mentioned it's fairly easy to come in here what you need to do is come in and add in a new client company in this case morning's II have I added a new voice flow project in which you have to add in some information like the project ID The Voice flow token API and things like this once you've added that information you just go to client Integrations create a new integration for that particular project and in this case we'll be going morning site AI the finance analyze project give it a name and then we get to select what channel we want we have WhatsApp Instagram Facebook or web chat so I of course chose the WhatsApp option and then I just used their automatic login feature so we just logged in with Facebook set up in business manager and connected everything up fairly easily so that was super easy to get things put onto WhatsApp so now I'm interested in getting this into Nina's hands and seeing what she thinks about it so let's jump on a qu now um so I have a phone number that you can add on WhatsApp M I've just sent it to you on a message and then I'll also send you the latest screenshot that I need to add it so the new system is going to use screenshots still um because that's the easiest way and I mean I could technically use this whatsa chatot but there is still a little bit of playing around with it that I have to do so um that's still going to be your your job so while this video is replacing my system with AI it's aiting my system with AI cuz you we can't replace you all right so I'll send you the screenshot now if you just send a message to the WhatsApp assistant it should say hi Nita what can I help you with and you'll see that there's a couple options there it's live expenses reality food started to kind of plan out how we could add new features onto it through different buttons but for now logo expens is the only want if you click on that I need what can I help you with yep and just send it the screenshot Le screenshot I just say the date was yes it was I mean when it asks you what the if it has a date then we need to check so it was Sunday the 31st so it go Sunday 31st of March okay so ask me if one of theen has a date I can just say no oh yeah no and then you put in that yeah yeah ride the oh you need to put it in that format actually so it's um 03224 no no no no uh wait 31 03 31 or3 yeah L America's got those luy dates to make sure you want I yeah I would just it okay so now when you get all those Cody looking things back just check that the DAT are all correct and then it's like 31st um it says 303 so it's 3 first with it's fine right good enough yeah and then go continue and then watch the notion and it should pop in see if you can catch it on screen boom got it okay got it how easy is that yeah spot with em right that's also helpful because I have to do this for like morning side as well and usually that one takes even longer and I can't get anything wrong um yeah so that's probably something we can modify the system for so anyway I want take you more that's the system I'll be sending all screen just to you now and you can just check way as you can see I've got those other little functions like I think the reordering food thing that you're having to do all the time could be cool on to add on to one of the SPs so I'll keep stuff into this of the type but um Dina thank you for your type and um welcome to the while you know know who is my assistant be seeing her on the channel so thanks Li hi guys so n is obviously pretty happy with the end result I didn't know it was taking 2 hours I thought it might have been half an hour and hour um but I'm very glad to have got that off her plate now um just to show you what the end result is after it's gone through and logged all those transactions the key part here is that I've got a a special prompt that I've written that's in the voice flow build that I'll be sharing with you guys as a template if you want to use it I'm going to be down on my school Community down below so you can get all the templates the make.com automation the voice for template everything you need to do uh to connect up a similar thing for yourself but this is the end result here so after it's categorized it all I then have a chart here that I'm using a platform called chart base and on chart base I've been able to set up a month that connects to my notion database with all of the expenses that get logged in there and I've got the DAT I've got the month along the bottom and I've got the amount on the side so allows me to see very easily month by month how much I'm spending and then it allows me to see sort of the Baseline costs that I have Associated to my lifestyle and like my apartment and things like this so one of the cool things that I've set up is this uncategorized feature which is like my inbox for my expenses so when Nina is going through and putting all those transactions through some of the transactions are either going to be uncategorized or they're unsure or in this case there'll be outward transfers of my account where money is left I've sent it maybe on my banking app it doesn't have any information as to who I'm sending the money to it just says transfer so I can come in here and see which ones haven't been categorized I can go that was for this person Etc and I can start to make sure every single one of my expenses is tracked properly there is a little bit more that I would like to do with this which is this top categories by month I think this graph would be a lot more useful if I had it knowing what I was spending per category per month so on my food it would' be nice to see okay February to March I spent less on food so that's something else that I'm probably going to try build into this app but uh I just thought I'd show you guys this video I was doing this anyway so I thought why not just make a little bit of a video about it showing you how you should be following your own curiosity if you are stuck and you trying to start an AI business or get into the space these are the kind of projects you should be looking at Building look I've applied my skills in make.com creating the automation I've used my notion skills to to learn how to use notion beta and set up these databases I've used voice flow to set up my chat box back in then I've used this new tool flowbridge to connect voice flow to WhatsApp and also integrate a gbt vision component into my app that the amount of learning that you will go through by trying to create some of these projects for yourself personally is immeasurable and this is how I got my start is just following my own Curiosities and scratching your own Edge I highly recommend for you guys if you're looking to get started and you're struggling to learn the different skills and you're like I need a course on voice flow I need a course on this or I need to just start just pick something like this and say hey look that's cool something lamed it I can try spin this to a different use case and connect it up using the similar tools follow those itches and that'll Lead You far further into the AI space and and towards success that you're likely looking for then if you're trying to look for someone do spoon feed it on a plate for you the exact Miracle recipe to learning a certain platform just get in there and start playing around I certainly learned a lot about notion and database structure during this project so it's all compounding and I highly recommend you guys do something similar to this but that's about all for the video guys I hope that's got the ideas flowing for you and the kind of projects you can build yourself all the templates and resources related to this if you want to replicate this or at least see how I've done this it's going to be available in my free school Community you can click on the YouTube Tab and you pull up one of the posts related to this video so everything's on there it's free to join um and there's a ton of other resources there as well if you've enjoyed this video of course hit down below leave a like leave a comment if you want to see other kinds of videos from me and subscribe to the channel if you want more AI related business content and how you can build and sell AI solutions to businesses but aside from that guys that's all for the video thank you so much for watching and I'll

              "text": "hey guys today I have a super quick tutorial for you showing how to set up chat GPT to make phone calls for you I'm calling to ask if you'd be interested in having lunch with Liam next Monday and just s off yes we're going to be using an AI calling service and connecting that to a custom GPT so that we could tell chat GPT hey here's this phone number can you please call them and do this it's going to be able to reach out and reschedule an appointment or create an appointment or ask them a question or confirm something so really cool let's jump into it so to start things off you're going to see a chat gbt Plus account it's going to allow you to create your own gbt so if we go to the explore gpts tab here create a new one I'm going to call this one my AI phone assistant call on my behalf for the prompt I'm going to paste in the one that I've created for this video it's quite a complex one but you guys are going to be able to get it on my free school Community down below so you can sign up to school you'll be able to find at the YouTube Tab and find this particular video and there'll be this prompt and everything related to this video will be available there so once we've got the prompt in there it's basically just saying that you are my personal AI assistant your main role is to make calls on my behalf to restaurants families businesses Etc in order to successfully make a call you need two things a phone number and a clear objective from the call depending on the objective of the call make sure you've collected sufficient information from me so that you can actually successfully complete the task so it's supposed to take in a phone number take in what I'm try to do on the phone number say call this person and do this and then if it has any questions it will ask me for any information that it thinks it needs to complete it successfully a conversation started is call someone for me uh we can leave we browsing on I don't think we'll need image generation then we get to the real meat and potatoes of this thing which is to create a custom action that using Bland AI so next step is to go to bland. a and create an account if you haven't already what we're trying to do within our GPT is to take this send call capability that bland AI has to send an outbound phone call and pull it into our GPT so that our chat GPT our custom GPT can fill out the information for us so here you can see on the right it might be a little bit technical for some of you but stay with me in order to successfully make an outbound phone call with BL AI we need to fill out some of this data here that you can see on screen so we need a phone number we need the task and we need the from Etc so these variables are what we're going to be filling with our GPT on the other side every time we want to make a call when you're on Bland itself and you fill out this information here and then click Send call we're going to be taking this exact same functionality by getting the GPT to fill out this form essentially and send a call using Bland's API the process of converting this into the open API schema that is required to provide it as a tool within your GPT is the tricky part but I've done this off camera for you so it'll be available on the school Community as well you want to copy that and just past P it in here and I can take you through it roughly a quick overview of what we're doing here so this is the Bland API and we're providing a URL that our GPT is going to be able to call and then we have a bunch of the variables that we need to pass in the schema has two different functionalities firstly it allows us to initiate a phone call so send off that information okay I want to call this person and I want to do this which we've just gone over on the Bland documentation there but it also has the ability to retrieve a transcript of the phone call so after the call has been completed we're going to be able to take that same phone call ID and say hey what actually happen in that phone call tell me what happens so that I'm on the same page if we scroll down a little bit further you can see the properties that are required to initiate a phone call so obviously we're going to need a phone number that we're going to be calling and then most importantly we have the task which is the purpose or objective of the phone call now this is the most important part for us because we're going to need to get the gpt2 based off our instruction saying I want you to do this it's going to need to generate a task a big prompt to send away to this phone call to to send away to Bland in order to actually successfully execute what we wanted to do before we jump into the nitty-gritty of getting the task probed coming out correctly we need to finish off creating our action here to provide our authentication to use the Bland API we need to head back to Bland go down to our account down the bottom we go API Keys API key we can copy it head back to chat gbt click on the Cog next to authentication go API key paste in your API key and then click on custom and we need to enter authorization and with that we can click save and then we've set up our Bland AI tool we can go back let's give it a little uh darly generated image we almost ready to give this thing a spin now but I want to take you back to the instructions here to show how we're instructing the gbt to correctly create the prompt or the task that we're sending off for every call so as I mentioned the Bland calls the outb Clause that we make with Bland require a task variable that is going to be the full prompt of UR this your job is to do this um you are supposed to be reaching out in order to book an appointment with this Etc So the instructions need to go into the task section and what I've done this is based off the the Bland documentation itself if you go to documentation here and the am hlb prompting guide all of this documentation here is something that I use in my voice agents regularly it is a very good structure and way of layout to get these things working correctly so if you want to take a look at this it's available on the documentation but I've taken everything from this and I've converted it into a prompt that's going to allow our custom GPT to generate these kind of specific prompts every time it sends a phone call as you can see down here I've got creating task prompts using the strict am hlb method and down here it explains how the task prompt should be structured gives an example script you can head down and get there from the school Community if you're looking to follow along but this prompt is really the most important part of this build alongside the open API scheme that's available on school as well right so now we're ready to give this thing a spin so hi can you please call someone for me it's asking for the phone number who I'm going to be calling and then the specific objective or message they like me to convey can you please call my business partner Josh and ask him if he wants to do lunch next Monday dle thought around 12:00 p.m. would be good but I am flexible within an hour each side I can only do mondy thought it's going to ask the phone number also is there a specific place and do off that you'd like to go for lunch so I can say yeah Elmo's Bakery is good and his phone number is right so now I should be able to get a phone call on my handy dandy phone here see it's going to pause while it writes that big long task prompt as we' specified in our instruction so I can pause for a little bit make sure it's written out quite a lot and you'll see just how much it's filled into that task prompt to really guide it and in terms of how it should be behaving on this phone call so we can pop this down here there we go I Josh bis Nino Liam's assistant we have this full prompt that's been written out which is in line with the Bland documentation on how to write these prompts so now I should be able to confirm this and I will get a call here on my phone hi Josh this is Nina Liam's assistant I'm calling to ask if you'd be interested in having lunch with Liam next Monday in dor he suggested Elmo's bakery around 12:00 p.m. but he's flexible up to an hour either side he mentioned he can only do Monday do you think that would work for you yeah could we do 1 p.m. Liam can accommodate within an hour of the proposed time so 1: p.m. at Elmer's Bakery will work perfectly he looks forward to meeting you there perfect thank you bye and there you go we've been able to successfully send a call from our gbt to the phone of in this case my business partner I'm asking me to confirm something so this is obviously just a start um I'm not trying to show you all the different use cases in this video I'm just showing you how you can create a custom tool for your gpts for your custom gpts whether you want to use this as a personal assistant or whether you want to build this into your systems and start to use these outbound calling capabilities within your build as well and as you can see here it's actually used the other fetch transcript tool that we provided when we set up our tool and it's given me a breakdown I was saying I've successfully contacted Josh and he's agreed to have lunch with you and the next Monday in dorf he requested it could be at 1: p.m. at almma Bakery Bas on your flexibility I confirm that it will work so then we get the transcript back that's actually part of the prompt where after the call is complete can you please give me a summary of what happened so yeah check out the prompt check out the schema I've done all the hard work for you here to make sure this is outputting the kind of responses you want so yeah go have fun with it use it for your personal use start to put in your own Solutions whatever you want to do if you've enjoyed the video please hit down below leave a like

              "text": "how does one of these times work for you 10 a.m. will be great our team is looking forward to helping you navigate your retirement planning with confidence if you're not experimenting with AI to automate your lead qualification and appointment setting then you are falling behind the good news is you don't need to be a tech Wizard or spend hours coding just to create one of these AI appointment sets for yourself in this tutorial I'll walk you through the process of setting one up step by step and I'll be giving you the exact prompt template I've been using to create these AI appointment Setters in minutes let's get into it what we're going to be building is an outbound AI appointment sitting system that is able to call leads after they have shown interest say on a lead capture or on your landing page and if the lead ends up being qualified for one of your offers it's going to attempt to book them into an appointment live on the call that directly integrates into your calendar and into there also this is a live booking system that's going to be able to negotiate and go back and forth and decide on the time I have found some available slots for your time zone what works for you Monday Tuesday or Wednesday based on a calendar and availability that we've set up beforehand which we to go over in a sec these kind of systems are crazy and yes they do work as you expect as you go to see shortly to get started you need to headit to synf flow. a there'll be a link down below this is not a promoted video I'm not sponsored by these guys at all I just tried a whole bunch of the different tools that are available and this one seem to be the best for this appointment set of use case in particular so you can create an account up here you can go get started I already have an account of course once you are inside sflow you're going to see a dashboard that looks a little bit like this now as you can see at the top I've already reached my plan limit of one assistant and this is the one downside of s flow that I will mention right now is the cost are pretty astronomical uh quite possibly the most aggressive pricing I've ever seen on any of the tools have ever shown on the channel or anything here so big disclaimer you can't follow this tutorial without at least upgrading to the starter plan they don't have a free one that allow you to do what I'm about to show you and a quick jump up to the Pro Plan is an I ordering $450 a month now this isn't a sponsored video but I will reach out to them and see if I can get a susp special offer for the community and then I might be able to continue to make videos on them in future but I know pricing isn't issue for a lot of you as it is for me at those kind of prices as well so once you've upgraded to stter then you can go back to the dashboard you'll see a screen that looks a little bit like this as I mentioned earlier we are going to be making an outbound appointment setup so we need to click on outbound here and then we can get into the configuration now this does look quite confusing but we can just rip through here and call this pointment set for the model we're going to choose gp4 turbo because it has quite a complex qualification script so we need a smart yet fast model and for the voice I'm just going to leave it the same for now voice synthesizer turbo stream let's leave it on that uh USA l W custom greeting for the custom greeting we're going to say hey comma is this first name this is in curly brackets with a question mark at the end and as you can see here created our first variable which we'll be going over in a second then we have settings like patience level and enable recordings I'll just leave those as is and then we get to the real meat and potatoes of this app which is the prompt and these actions that we can set up we'll start with the prompts first as I've created a special tool for it and then we can jump into the realtime booking after that because right in the prompt there's really 90% of the work of getting one of these AI appointment sets up and running I've taken a few hours yesterday to create create a tool for you that you're all going to be able to use and it's going to take in a bunch of information and automatically generate a high performing AI appointment set of script so that you don't have to mess around and do all of the research I've had to do to get one that actually works well nice for the sake of this tutorial I'm going to generate some dummy data to fill out this with just to give it a test obviously for your use case you'll use your own business data that offens that you're trying to sell through it or if you're doing it for a client you can input their data as well I'm going to hit over to Claude and say can you write some dummy dat data for this prompt generator tool I'm using CLA over chat gbt quite a lot now cuz it seems to be a lot better as we can see here we're starting to get some data coming through now that we have the data we can start to copy and paste it over into the tool itself of course if you guys want to get this tool for free it's going to be available on my free school Community it'll be the first link down in the description you can click on that it'll take you through the school and then in order to get all the resources for this video there'll be a little tab up the top called YouTube resources you can click on that and then find this videos post and inside it will be the link to this AI appointment seter that you can use so up for quite a lot of work and getting this tool working for you all so please use it um it's going to make your process of creating these hitters so much quicker so just wrapping through here now I'm going to copy and paste over this information offers and qualifying criteria let's give a bit of spacing faq's target audience and strangely this agent's name is leam so we can put that there there is one change I want to make to this data which is to remove this other option for a call we can only set up one option to book a call and the other one we can do with SMS I'm not going to set up the SMS in this video but it's fairly easy to do with the same kind of process I'm about to show you so the top offer is going to be to book and a call if they're qualified and if they don't qualify for the top offer they'll be sent an SMS with some other information you can pause the video to take a look at the information that I've filled out here um I've provided as much information as I can in the notes here so that when you guys are using it you know exactly the kind of information to put in to get the best results but basically this is a financial planning firm for retirees and stuff once you filled up the information in the tool then you go down and you can click run does take a minute or two it's quite a long process but the output is something like this very well structured utilizing all of the best practices for writing these AI voice agent prompts and here you can see we get a complete script we get FAQs and we get final details and everything we need for an AI appointment set to work as we expect has been included in this here you can see the offers and the qualifying criteria for prospects with 1 2 million in investable assets who are from 5 to 10 years from retirement book a 30-minute retirement orance assessment call for prospects who don't meet the asset or retirement timeline criteria follow up with an SMS so these are the two offers that the setter is able to present if by answering the questions in the script down here the AI is able to determine that they meet the qualification criteria for this 30-minute retirement Readiness assessment then it's going to attempt to book them in for a follow-up call which we're going to set up in a second but most importantly if they don't meet that qualification criteria it can essentially down sell them to the lower offer and in this case it's sending an SMS with a link to retirement planning guide so if they don't meet the top qualification criteria then the seter is smart enough to be able to down sell them and trigger a different action so that you're capturing as much of this value of these interested leads as possible all we need to do now to plug this into our voice agent is to copy this head back over to synf flow and then we can expand this prompt out and I'm going to paste it in there now that we've got the prompt in there I'm going to save and close and then we get to jump into the realtime booking aspect of it which may sound difficult but it's actually quite straightforward to do so if we click here you'll see that we have two options we have highle or we have cal.com what we're going to be doing in this tutorial is the cal.com setup which is fairly straightforward to do so cal.com what I'm going to do is click the login button and then I'm going to click don't have an account so we can create an account I'm going to continue here with Google to make my account a little bit faster then I'm going to put in my details I'm going to put tutorial account 01 full name time zone set that up then you get to go through and connect your calendar so pick the calendar that you want to use I'm using Google calendar fa easy to do I'm going to allow it all access to Google Calendar I'm going to use Google meet for my video calling next step and for the hours I'm just going to leave like this you can modify it as you wish and I'm just going to skip this for now then you'll be taken to the dashboard that looks a little bit like this so now we can jump back over to synf flow and in order to get our API key and our Cal event ID we need to go back to cal.com and we click on these settings here we go to API Keys we click add new call this tutorial I'm going to set it to never expire save that copy this paste in the API key here and then we need to go back and get the event ID and this can be done by going to the events page I can click on the 30 minute meeting here and then up the top here we need to click on this little ID here so the number after the slash there we need to copy this and take it back to sylow and paste in the Cal ID give it a second and then click next then we're going to need to do a little bit more setup won't take long for time zone I'm going to set it to the New York time zone so E I think that's where most callers will typically be coming in from first appointment date is 23rd that's fine number of days out from 23rd that they're able to book is three number of time slots in a single day let's have three um number of hours difference I want to have these backed up pretty close so let's put this at one hour between each of the calls so I've go next and what you can see as we've set up we have our realtime booking action set up now the final thing you won't be seeing something like this on your account just yet you'll need to set up your twilio account so for twio you can go to twilio.com very easy to set up log in log in or create an account if you haven't already once you're into a twio account you need to set up your billing so add a credit card on file there then we can come to the phone number section to the manage section and click on buy a number we're going to need to buy one number that's going to be able to do these calls for us for the sake of this tutorial you can just grab any other one here it's going to cost you a dollar a month click Buy there may be some hoops that make you jump through here for compliance just go through all the forms and do as they say here and then you're going to be able to buy your phone number and it will appear in your account in the active number section over here once you can see it in the active number section here there's one more thing that I like to make sure you've changed and that's to go into voice here go down to settings and click on Geo permissions and here is where you can set up the permissions that you're allowed to call in your account whatever countries you're expecting to need to call you're going to need to come in here and say in my case United Arab Emirates yep I've checked that United States Etc so come in here and made sure you've enabled any countries that you suspect you're going to need to call or too is not going to work for you and once you've got that set up to finish the connection with cflow we need to go to the top left here my first t account and just click on the button here it's going to take you to your dashboard and then within your dashboard you're going to see this account Sid and the off token here these are the two fields that you're going to need to take back over to synth flow for for most of you it'll probably be screaming at you up here that you need to set it up but if it's not showing there you can click on the Integrations Tab and here you see the fields you need to put in so you can paste in your account Sid and the or token and save it and then you'll be integrated successfully with your twio account heading back to our assistant we are almost ready to test this thing out one last thing I like to do is just check through this prompt for any little errors that the generator has made I'm going to give the firm a name for Williams Financial a boutique financial planning blah so we got a name for the firm there's two offers that they're able to do one is a call the other is a SMS which we're not going to set up as I mentioned I'm going to remove the this instruction here so it doesn't play around with the variables just going to check over the script make sure I'm okay with it and make sure it has this appointment setting part which is how does date at time work for you and that looks pretty good to me if aqs all fine and there's one more B I want to remove which is the explanation of who the firm is I don't think that's necessary considering they've opted into something here and because if you remember we chose a female voice for our agent I'm going to change this to uh Lily and change this to Lily as well and with that we're good to save and finally now that we're happy with the thing and we have a realtime booking set up we can head to the test assistant screen up here on the side and put in my name I'm going to put in my phone number so that it calls my phone I'm going to have the first name is Liam then we have the Cal time zone and the email this seems to be the email that's connected to the prospects calendar so that when it creates the booking it's going to send both an invite to you and to them as well it's going to appear on both so when you're doing your your collection or whether this is a lead form or whatever kind of method you're using to capture this data before you send the outbound call to set the appointment then you need to make you're capturing the right email that's connected to their calendar also we have a cal time zone here I'm setting it as New York by default you can collect that in the lead form as well now this all ready to go I can give it a [Music] spin what's up Liam Yep this is Liam who's this hi Liam this is Lily from Williams Financial I'm reaching out because you've shown interest in navigating your retirement transition through our online assessment do you have a moment to discuss how we can assist you in achieving a worry free retirement uh yeah sure I got a few minutes to ensure we provide the most value during our conversation may I ask a couple of quick questions about your retirement planning goals and Current financial situation uh yes sure how close are you to your planned retirement date within the next 5 10 years perhaps yeah I'm planning to retire within uh maybe 5 or 6 years and would you say your investable assets fall within the $1 2m range yeah yeah they do lastly what are your main concerns or goals when it comes to retirement planning for example maintaining lifestyle minimizing taxes or Legacy planning probably just maintaining my lifestyle based on what you've shared I believe a retirement Readiness assessment call with one of our certified financial planners would be incredibly beneficial for you we can discuss your unique situation in detail and how we can help address your concerns and goals before I suggest some dates and time may I confirm if you're in the America New York time zone no I'm not in the New York time zone I am in the Dubai time zone Asia Dubai thank you for that information Liam I have found some available slots for your time zone what works for you Monday Tuesday or Wednesday Monday would be good great for Monday I can offer you the following times for the retirement Readiness assessment call 9 0 a.m. 10 0 a.m. or 110 a.m. Dubai time how does one of these times work for you 10:00 a.m. will be great fantastic I have you scheduled for 10: a.m. on Monday March 25 2024 Dubai time you'll receive a calendar inv shortly with all the details our team is looking forward to helping you navigate your retirement planning with confidence before we wrap up do you have any other no Lily that's great thank you very much Lily B and there you go you saw me as I was going through this is the first test run so you get to see the issues that happen in the script there's a couple things here with the the dollars so instead of 1 M plus we need to write out 1 million and then the the little introduction here that was worry free she said worry free so as you go through the first pass you'll get to see a couple things that we need to edit 5 to 10 years I think it was just one to $2 million rank we can change it to words so1 to2 million rank and as you heard it checked with me the time zone and I was able to tell the time zone I was in and then was able to successfully book in this meeting between Liam Motley and Liam um I Got a notification and it's set at the correct time so that's about it for the build I hope you guys think this is as cool as I do being able to book live on the phone like that is really impressive and the fact that I haven't had to write a single line of code this platform does it all for me as I mentioned the pricing is pretty steep but I think for the amount of functionality you get out of this if you're able to do it either as an agency these kind of solutions seem to be taking off right now if you're watching this video you are in the perfect place to start taking advant of some of these incredible solutions that we have I think for the agencies who are trying to sell these Solutions this is by far the easiest and most high value solution that I've ever seen in the AI automation space because we've done AI agents before we've done chat Bots but this is allowing you to do all of the cool things that these agents typically do but you can this is the this is the interface This Is How They are contacting them instead of having to have some kind of deployment to Instagram this going straight to the phone pick up value form very easy and lightweight for you to do there's no technical Integrations between different platforms apart from the basic thing with cal.com so do not sleep on this opportunity as I mentioned all of the resources available to recreate this The Prompt generator and everything is going to be included on my free school Community down in the description so you can join that find the resources join the discussion everyone in my school Community is loving these kind of things right now so if you're not in there and you're trying to start an AI business I don't know what you're doing it's the number one place to be without paying a diet so jump in there and I look forward to seeing you on my free Friday q&as with the school Community I have a ton more awesome AI voice use case videos coming on the way so make sure you subscribe to the channel and not miss those and let me know down in the comments if there's anything in particular in this AI voice realm that you want me to focus on and make a video on I'm more than happy to do that for you guys if there's enough attention on that comment but if you are new to the AI business realm and want to start your own business in 2024 click here to watch my complete guide to starting an AI business up here it's over an hour and a half long if you haven't watched it already aside from that guys thank

              "text": "this is an AI SAS for e-commerce before you go would you be interested if I could offer you a special discount to complete your purchase today today I'll show you how to recreate their entire solution in minutes so that you can start to sell it to e-commerce stores yourself and you won't have to write a single line of code let's get into it this platform is called a sales. and they're the world's first conversational AI for e-commerce and what the S does is recovers abandoned checkouts by using an outbound AI voice agent that's going to call people after they abandon their cart and say hey how are you doing is anything I can help you out with I noticed you abandon your card at checkout then they can ask back and forth answer any questions Etc but the key thing is that they can send a discount code or make a special offer to people who have abandoned cart and if the customer is interested it will send an SMS to the customer with a link to return to the checkout and the discount code included here we can see a little demo this Amanda who's this hi this is Lexi with nectar energy I just noticed you left some items in your heart did you have any questions about your order U no I'm okay thank you okay well before you go do you want me to check if I can get you a discount U no it's all right I'm just browsing right now um let me see what I can do for you Amanda to get sure attempt to get them an Al great just a heads up this code is only valid until the end of the day short of an emergency would there be any reason you can't use it tonight uh no great so you can just click that link to return to your checkout and we'll ship your product straight to you is there anything else I can help you with no SS good thank you okay no problem well it was a pleasure speaking with you Amanda I hope you have and so this's the system it's really simple sales script it's going to ask them how they're doing if there there any reason that they abandon the checkout and then it's going to push for sending them an SMS containing a discount code and a link to recover their checkout here you can see that the call Cost was 12 cents and they recovered 37 just from this example here so I saw this and I thought that sounds a lot like Ai and it sounds like we can do this pretty easily with the right tools and so that's what I've done and better yet I found a way to do it using absolutely zero code using a new platform that I've just talked about on the channel recently which is called zappia Central now this is particularly interesting because if you've been in the space for a while you know that e-commerce has been one of those niches that everyone wants to make solutions for but it's been pretty tricky to find something that actually provides a lot of value yes you can make a customer support agent but this kind of solution for e-commerce is so powerful because you're directly driving revenue for the business this is recovering these abandoned cards which was going to be lost Revenue anyway so using an AI outbound system to just dial all of these spend a few cents to try and recover it is a massive win for the business so I'm super excited to show you guys how to do this and for you guys to start selling this to your own customers the way we're going to be building this as mentioned is on zapia Central we're going to be setting up an abandoned cart trigger so whenever an abandoned cart is left let go to trigger an Automation and then the automation is going to send an outbound phone call with the information from the abandoned cut and then on that call the AI agent from Bland AI which we're going to be using for this build is going to attempt to send them a discount code and get confirmation that they want to get the discount and continue their purchase to get things started we need to create an account on zapia if you haven't already we're going to be using the new automation Builder called Central which I've covered recently on a video here here if you want to check that out for some more background on it um but we're going to be jumping straight into Central and building this thing out now once F to zap your central we want to create a new bot here on the left once we've created a new bot we can give it a name call it abandoned cart recovery and then we need to start setting up BS called behaviors and zapia Central now zapia Central allows us to nit together a bunch of different automations for example a trigger for an abandoned car to a send an outbound Voice using Bland Ai and we can knit together all of these different actions without having to line them up in sequence like we've traditionally had to do with automations by putting in instructions or prompting here we can instruct it how to chain together these actions it's really really cool you guys are going to want to stick around for this first things first the trigger for this action needs to be an abandoned cart of course so if we can go here and search up Shopify Shopify the action we want to be triggering based off is a new Abed cut I've already set up my connection but if you don't have one already you need to create a Shopify account and you need to set up the store as you like put a couple dummy products on it once you have that ready to go you can come back here and follow the setup wizard to connect your store to zapia once you have this connection set up it's fairly easy to do then we want to set up some information like this the abandoned card age let's put it at 0.1 hours and continue now we have this trigger of new abandoned card what you want to do is go over to your Shopify back end what i' like to do here is search for consent and we go to consent for marketing and check out here if we scroll down you can see the marketing options of email or SMS in order to be able to legally call these people they need to have opted in for our SMS so this isn't going to get every single abandoned car but it will get ones where they provided their phone number and they've also contented to SMS marketing what's handy to do here is to make sure that the shipping address phone number is either optional or required what this does is give us another way that we can capture their phone number in the checkout process so make sure the SMS is checked either optional or required shipping number when going save that then if I go through to my checkout I fill some things in the cart let's put maybe two of these things in here and we go to check out want to create some dummy data that's going to allow us to test this within zappi centrals and then here we can put in a phone when you're doing this make sure you put the phone that you want be receiving the testing calls to so in this case I'm going to use my Skype number so that I can receive them here on my computer and here is the SMS cons set which is accept updates on my order by phone then we can put in the same phone number here as well if you want to customize the text here like I have to be accept updates on my order by phone so that you get more opts we can go to the customiz sign up labels here and that same menu within the Shopify back end and then you go to the theme settings here and as you scroll down you'll see checkout and marketing accept SMS checkbox label and you can make this whatever you want so in my case accept updates on my order by phone sounds like it's got some benefit to them rather than just I think the default is text me with using offers so changing it a little bit might increase those opin rates nowu we go on here we can put a bunch of rubbish in here now that we've filled out all this dummy data we can close the page and we can go back to zap here and while we give our abandon cart a little bit of time to do its thing and Trigger as you can see we've got an abandoned cart age here of1 1 hour so we need to give it a little bit of time for it to process through the system in the meantime we can set up the next step which is going to be using Bland AI which is going to be what we use for our outbound phone call and we're going to do send a phone call here first thing you need to do is set up your Bland AI connection so there'll be a link down below to sign up the Bland AI this is not sponsored video no one's sponsoring this I'm not making a dive from any of these platforms Bland AI is just a handy one that I found with a zapia action we can use which makes it a lot easier than trying to have to do it the custom way so over on blad AI you need to sign up to an account once you have your account set up you need to come here and create a bland AI connection so mine's already connected but in your case it'll be connect a your connection and you go through this process of signing into zapia and then you need to provide your API key from Bland which you can find by clicking on your name here and on your API key section here and go to the API key section and you can either copy this or you need to create a new one and when you click on the profile here you will have your name this is the name you need to put in for the other field of setting up your Bland connection this Bland AI task has a lot of things we need to fill out first we have the phone number of the person we're trying to call this is going to be pulled from the PRI step the abandoned cart data that's going to be grabbed from Shopify the zappia central AI is going to be able to autofill this so we can leave this as AI generate the value and for the task here we're going to need to create a full prompt which I've already written for you which I'll show you in a second this task is basically describing what the AI should do on the call who it is the prompt basically all of the instructions in the script for what it should be following which we'll get to in a second reduce latency we can set to true voice we can set to the default one for now request data we can skip so do not include a value for this answering machine detection we can go false for now WEP do not include for this field for from we can go don't include a value for this field transfer phone number do not include a value for this field for record we're going to set it to a specific value of false just so we're all in the clear here legally wait for greeting we're going to set the specific value and change it to false for the first sentence we going to leave this AI to generate language we go to set a specific value of English Max duration we can set it to a specific value of 5 minutes Dynamic data we can not include data for this Interruption threshold we can skip this one as well for voice settings we can skip this one for should enabled answer bu we can do false start time we can skip as well in the model we can select a specific value and in this case I like to choose the enhanced one I find it performs the best and for temperature finally let's set it this to 0.1 and once we have all of this information filled out we can then add this as an action now we need to tell zap Central how to use these different actions and squs which in this case case I've already created it all here and we can copy this prompt over this prompt will be available on my school Community it's for free to join down in the description it'll be the first link there and then when you go to the YouTube tab once you're inside school it might take a few minutes to be l in but once you're inside School there'll be a YouTube Tab and you can click on the post related to this video and there going to be all the information required to copy this build so this prompt if I paste it in it'll show you a little bit of where we're going here but basically we're needing to give instructions about how the zapia central AI is able to use these different tasks so the first step is to trigger this automation when a new abandoned card is received and then first let's analyze the abandoned card data to see if they've firstly accepted SMS marketing and if they have then look for a phone number anywhere in the data provider that's why I toggled the shipping phone number option so that there's increased chance of us getting a more surface area for us to capture one of those phone numbers then if you find a phone number and they accept SMS marketing then send a phone call to blad AI to the number they provide it you then need to fill in the Bland AI task field again what I mentioned before Bland AI when to send a prompt way basically to tell this outbound phone call who it's supposed to be what it's supposed to do with the script is supposed to follow and so to do so input the following prompt describing the task make sure to replace the customer name variables with the customer name from the abandoned card data so you're starting to see how flexible the system is it's using AI to cleverly connect these different zaps together so here we have here we have the start of the prompt or the task we're going to send off to BL AI neor energy AI Voice Assistant script for a Bandon C followup so you can pause the video and take a look at how this Bland AI task has been written basically this is based off the a sales exact script word for word so it's going to be Nector energy offering them if they want to get a discount and at the end it's going to be saying hey I'll send you an SMS with the information from here up is what the AI is going to be autofilling that field in the Bland AI task so it figures out that this is what we want to put in and it's going to send that off as part of the instructions to make the phone call now we can quickly fill out the rest of the actions to complete this Automation and then I'll take you to the prompt and how it's all tied together so next one is going to be using a delay by zepia so what we want to do is when the call is underway we don't want to trigger the next step of the automation automatically so what we can do is use a delay for and time delayed set a specific value we want to delay it for say 5 minutes and delay for a Time unit of minutes add action so that's what's going to happen while we're waiting for the phone call to complete because after that we need to go back to Bland Ai and we want to get the transcript this time using the same Bland AI connection you had before then we have the call identifier which is based off the outbound call we just sent so the AI will have to insert this from the priz step so again very intelligently it can look back into the Bland AI information from the call that we sent and then pull the call identifier and automatically fill this part of the action we're can to add that there next we need to go in and get a URL shortener by zapia we want to shorten the URL and again we're going to use the AI to autofill the input for this the reason we have this URL shortening step is because in order to send the SMS as you can see it here in order to send this the Shopify Bandon cart URLs are very very long and twio we're going to be using to send the follow-up SMS with the uh discount code and the link to recover the checkout doesn't let you send messages more than 320 characters or something I think it's default for all SMS messages anyway but in order to get around this so that we can send the full URL we're going to use a link shortener and zap here has a handy one ready to go and then finally what we're going to do is use toio so if you haven't already you can H to toio and create an account and in order to be able to send these smss you're going to need to purchase a phone number you can go buy a number here you may have already had to do this for your Bland AI account setup anyway but once you have a number you can purchase it here and you'll see it in active numbers once it's good to go and then you can just go through the setup process of connecting your twio account here once you have it all set up then for the from number I'll pick a specific one of my numbers let's go this one I'll have ai generate the data for this and for the message I'll also allow the AI to do it because we're going to give it it in the prompt by now we have all of the actions added in that we're going to need to perform this automation but you can see this final bit of the prompt here that is the glue that ties it all together we we've been through how we're sending this prompt off to Bland a it toate the call but the bit after this is where it gets interesting so once you've sent the phone call use the delay action to wait for 5 minutes to give time for the conversation to happen once the delay is complete then you can use a get transcript action from Bland AI to fch the call transcript to get the transcript you'll need to use the call ID you received from the send phone call step earlier to look up the call that just happened so as I mentioned you need the call identifier and we go to pull this from earlier on the conversation and earlier on the automation by instructing it on how to get that information and where to use it once you have the transcript what you're looking for on the call is if the voice assistant says they will send a customer the SMS with a link to check out and a discount code if the assistant did mention sending some kind of SMS to the user then then you need to use the send SMS action from twio to send an SMS to the mobile number that we sent the call to earlier so again we're tying all of these actions together and instructing it in natural language how to use it and the sort of conditional statements we want to cover here so instead of using all the complex kind of tree diagrams and stuff like this we can just say if this happens do this if this happens do this and as you can see here if the transcript does not appear to have the full content of a call EG it's just got the the first few lines of it it may have fetched it before the call is finished so I instruct it here if this appears to be the case try to the transcript up to three more times in an attempt to determine if the SMS needs to be sent if after trying this three times there's still no mention of sending an SMS to the user then abandon this process entirely go no further as you'll see when we test it the delay by zapia doesn't really work within Central at the moment so this is my kind of little workaround and then we get into the final bit of sending this SMS so if they mentioned sending an SMS then we need to convert the abandoned cart recovery URL into a shortened URL using the shortened URL action once you have the shortened URL the SMS cont it should be as followed make sure you replace the variables in the data from the abandoned cart as the variables clearly show so hi first name pulling the information from the abandoned cart your 20% discount code is nect to 20 complete your purchase here and we're using new line characters to make sure that it's formatted I see in the SMS complete your purchase here then I have a dummy variable put in here of shortened abandoned cart recovery link cheers new line modern theed energy tape now what actually here we have the here syst is called corner so let's stick in line with that so let's make it in line with that make sure this SMS is less than 32 characters and contains no Emojis or it will be truncated by the 20 IPI so once we've done that I can click done and it's time to give this a spin so if we want to test it firstly we can just click test 10 let's go to create a new thread this is how zapy Central Works you've got like a one action is represented by one of these blocks and then and then it has has this thread that can pop out on the side so new abandoned cart we can see all the data here this is the phone number I put into the abandoned cart at checkout and then SMS consent collected the consent for the SMS marketing has been included as well if we go down does take quite a while the zapy central isn't the fastest platform at the moment but in a second we should receive a call from this Bland AI step we've set up here you can see the data from the abandon cart we have the SMS marketing consent collected from Shopify level single optin so we've consented to the SMS marketing where have the we also have the phone number that was left that check out as well and this gives us the information we need to go into the next step so here we go oh here we have the call coming in I can answer it on my phone [Music] here hey guys just finishing up the edit for this video here and I wanted to throw in that I'm going to be doing a giveaway SL hackathon and a prize Associated so $11,000 is going to be up grabs for the best zappy essential solution idea I think there's only so much my brain can do I want to give this to you guys as a community to come up with awesome new ideas and also give have the chance to win a bit of money for it as well so if you want to be part of that and you have some cool ideas that you think you can contribute to the community and come up with then you can join the free school Community down below there'll be a post attached to it with a $1,000 prize and you can join the conversation there so back to the video hello is this Liam oy yeah who's this hi this is Conor with nectar energy I've noticed you left some items in your cart do you have any questions about your order uh no I just I just wasn't ready to check out sorry I understand and I appreciate your interest in our products before you go would you be interested if I could offer you a special discount to

to return to your checkout you can complete your purchase and we'll ship your product straight away is there anything else I can assist you with no that's all thank you bye all righty so that cool we well as you can see we're getting these errors from the delay from zapia I think this is something to do with them not being compatible with Central yet but anyway it does the job of delaying this thing um to give us time for the transcript to be fully complete so that we can analyze it properly so while it says there an error happening it's still kind of doing its job of delaying the next step uh so as you can see here it should do a transcript analysis right now yep action in progress so if we open up the blad I get transcript you can see that we've got the whole transcript and it splits it into nice messages down here so if we go down a little bit we can see um fantastic news I'll offer you a discount code I've just sent you a text with a discount code and a link to return to checkout so yes the transcript does contain something saying we're going to send them the link and that's what the AI is looking for then it's using the next action we instructed it to use which was to shorten that abandoned cart URL so that we can send it VI an SMS and then we've sent it by SMS we can see the data here yep all good to go and the final step to make this has all worked you may have heard that my Skype notification went off if I go to Skype yep and we have our text here High Lim your 20% off discount code is NE to20 complete your purchase here cheers corner and the connect the energy team and just like that we've been able to recreate this AI e-commerce SAS just by using zapia Central without writing a single line of code I hope you guys are as excited as I am about the potential of this technology as I mentioned in my earlier zapia Central video I think this stuff is the best thing that's happened for beginners trying to get into the AI automation agency space and create system and build solutions for businesses to allow them to adopt Ai and I almost forgot the final thing you need to do to turn this thing live and get this to work on every single abandoned card that comes through for your client's store or for your own is to click on this behaviors down here turn the switch to on and now every abandoned card that comes through is going to go through this process here and you'll be able to see it in this activity tab going through behind the scenes this is just a particularly awesome example and I'm sorry to the guys at AA sales you guys doing

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you step by step how you can turn Instagram into a lead generating Powerhouse for your AI agency by completely automating your Instagram Outreach Instagram is a treasure Trove of potential clients yet most agency owners don't propably utilize the platform why because they don't have a reliable way of automating the Instagram Outreach and to send DMS manually will take up to an hour every day just to reach the 50 messages per day that Instagram allows per account the good news is today I'll be guiding you step by step through completely automating your code Outreach Instagram by using a simple and affordable tool that would turn Instagram into a consistent stream of new leads for your AI agency if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI agency called morning side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world but I teach people how to build and sell AI solutions to businesses let's get stuck into it well first things first before we put any time into bothering to set up some kind of Instagram Outreach system should probably understand why would use Instagram in the first place and this is because we have over 2 billion users on the platform people are active all week and at all hours so it's not just like an email inbox where they might be available from 9: to 5: uh from Monday to Friday people are always on Instagram it is much more personal there's less business Communications going on there so it's a much more personal way of getting in touch with people and they're not really expecting to be sold as much as on things like email or eled and things like that what makes Instagram especially good is that it's hyper targeted you can look at their profile or you can scrape their profile you can see exactly what this person is about who they are they'll tell you who they are in their bio so very very very targeted that you're able to scrape blists and then also analyze them afterwards and secondly why do we need to automate our Outreach on Instagram at all while Instagram is a platform they try not to let you be really business here they don't like using it for these kind of purposes so Instagram actually has a 50 messages per day limit on terms of call DMS you're able to send out so that alone is 50 messages per day but those 50 messages per day you can only send 10 per hour so if I go on there if you ever tried to do this manually you'll know how painful this can be you'll open up 10 profiles and you'll copy and paste the same DM 10 times and then eventually Instagram will stop letting you send the message and you have to wait for another 50 minutes or however long it's taken so you can start again the next hour I can tell you from personal experience trying to hit those 10 messages per hour manually is such a waste of time and energy your focus is just sapped so getting some kind of tool or software that can do this but for you it's so important to get your time back as an entrepreneur for many of you starting out try to get your first client that is such a waste of time that I do not want you guys to do but the particularly tricky thing about Instagram is Instagram doesn't have some API that allows you to automatically send messages on on of your account that they really don't like that so there's basically no platforms that allow you to do this automated Outreach but there is one platform that can do this for you that I'm aware of and that's what we're going to be going over in this video the platform is called Auto igdm and it's actually created by two original members of my accelerator toada and AAL from the Omni Fusion AI team you may know them if you've been watching my channel for a while but sadar and ail have created Auto igdm which allows us to do this Automation and the way that auto igdm allows us to do this automation is that it actually takes control of our browser and another window and then it goes through this 10 per hour process and can send out those 50 DMS every day for you not only can you send those 50 DMS per day on just one account they have agency plans that allow you to get multiple seats so you can stack 5 10 20 different accounts and be sending out thousands of DMS per day if you want to we're not going to be getting into the advanced stuff like that on this video but I am going to show you how to set up at least a way to send 1,500 DMS per month and start to increase your chances of Landing your first client or continuing to get a stream of consistent leads through Instagram I'm about to jump in and show you how to set up your first campaign on autoag gdm but first we need to decide what is our strategy here you may have known by now if you are trying to do Outreach as an AI agency you need to kind of have an idea of of who you're talking to for something that you're selling because you can't just say I do AI stuff and just blast it to everyone you're not going to get any responses so we need to have a little bit of a strategy here in terms of how we're going to approach writing our messages who we're going to be sending to the lead generation and the crafting of the messages is going to be covered in this as well the first step is deciding who we're trying to get in touch with so in order to be able to send these DMS as we're going to in a second we need to build a list we need to scrape them from a certain account there's a couple ways that auto igdm allows you to do this you can do it based on someone's following so if we can find one account that is followed by a lot of the people that we want to reach out to this may be an influencer or a leader in the space it may be some kind of platform Etc if we're able to find one of these we can scrape all of their followers and put that into a list and then we can start to send those DMS out 50 per day every day there's also ways that we can do it by hashtags and we can do it by putting in a ton of links to post but in this particular video and in this demo I'm going to do it based on following what I need to do now what you you need to do before you set up your campaigns also is decide who am I trying to get in touch with and how can I get a whole bunch of them collected on one account so that's what we're going to do now now we can jump into setting up our campaign so the first step is to go to auto IG dm.com there'll be a link down below this is not a sponsored video I'm not being paid for this at all I'm just happy to be sharing something from my community that is a powerful and helpful tool for agency owners to start to get their first clients and be a to automate perect DMS per day I think is a great way to get started and easy foot on the door especially when you use the message templates I'm about to provide you I'm more than happy to be sharing this on the Channel with you all today so Auto DM it down below to get started we can click up here start for free this has a 7-Day trial on their starter plan which allows you to send 50 DMS per day P siiz messaging and all the features that you need I already have an account of course but when you click create your account there to go to ask for your card details that is not to charge your card at all that is just to verify it so there's not going to be any billing done there it's just purely for them to do the verification step to make sure that the card is real so once you've created an account and you've signed in you'll see a screen that looks a little bit like the so here we are into the auto igdm back end this is actually just one part of the app and we can set up our settings for our Outreach campaigns the other key part of it and what you'll be interacting with the most of the time it's going to be the Chrome extension there'll be a link down below to this also and once you've installed it you'll see it up here you'll want to right click and pin it so it's going to stay on your your browser tab here and then we get to see this interface here so in this video I'm going to be using an example of I'm trying to get in touch with business coaches and I'm going to be offering them General AI services like I have some kind of AI tools or systems that can help them improve their business this is a way of reaching out and being specialized on the niche side but not saying hey I can build you XYZ that's going to allow you to get onto some Discovery calls can have some conversations with the people in the niche and then you can kind of edate your way towards finding a solution for them at a later date firstly we can scrape the followers of someone's accounts we just need to find the right person or we can do it by hashtag and put a ton of hashtags in it will scrape the most recent post or we can do it by post themselves so doing it by account and scraping someone's following is usually the easiest way of doing things because you might be able to get 5,000 or 20,000 people who are following more but for verified accounts like Dave here I can't scrape his following Instagram doesn't allow us to get the following of people who are verified so we can only scrape by account people who don't have the blue check mark so that makes it a little bit difficult sometimes so if I wanted to build a list of people who are following or engaging with someone like davier sorry to use you as an example here Dave but you can see if I go here and I can collect all the people are engaging on this post all the likes that he's getting I can get the post ID here and I can copy this post ID I can go back to Auto igdm I can paste in the post your out and so I can continue to put a ton of different posts there and then all of the people who are liking or commenting on his post I'm able to add those into my list and start to read out to them so this is the way you can get around the the issue of not being able to scrape a verified accounts you can then go in and put a whole bunch of posts in there and it's going to pull all the people who have engaged with it so this can kind of be better than followers in many ways because you're able to get the most engaged people who are actually active but for the sake of this tutorial I'm going to be reaching out to a target audience of business coaches so people who coach people how to have a better business and one of the accounts that I'm aware of that has a lot of like high level business coaches that are following it is scaling by systems here by Ravi abuvala sorry Ravi if you're watching this U I wouldn't recommend anyone try to scrape and and message these guys the same way that I'm going to be doing in this video um you definitely can't stand up to the C of value that Rob's dropping I'd definitely try to find someone else cuz there's not much you can do to compete with guys like this I know this account is followed by a lot of business coaches who are my target market for this example but in your case whatever Niche you want to reach out to you need to find an account like this or find a figure like Robbie himself and you can go in there and get the list and build the list of their account now that I found an account that I can build my list off of I can go up here and you'll see if I put in the account here and I go scanning the systems and I add it then I have two settings here I have a tag and I have a message so that's what we're going to set up now if we go back to Auto agdm we can go to our text templates as you can see I've got one here called AI for coaches General so this is not any specific solution it's kind of just a general I do AI stuff for coaches and you can see some of the examples that I have here this might look a bit weird that we have intros bodies and outros but this is also part of what IGM does for us to enable us to automate our Outreach so if you keep sending the same message over and over and over again then Instagram would pick up on it and be like Oh no you're getting bad or you're getting timeout or something and we definitely don't want that for our accounts so what Auto igdm does is asks us to put in multiple different variations of the same thing or you could even test multiple ways of messaging them and see what the response is but what it's going to do for us is automatically mixes around to make sure that account always stays in good standing with Instagram and a handy thing that it allows us to do is to insert variables like the first name here to make it more personalized I know the thought of writing all of these might seem a little bit overwhelming especially For You beginners in here so I've taken the time today ahead of this video to create a handy dandy relevance tool that you guys can get access to on my school Community for free there'll be a post under the YouTube section for this particular video that'll include this as one of the resources what this is going to allow you to do is to put in your Niche and also the offer it can be something specific egy system to handle your customer support or if you just have an idea and you want to get in front of a niche but you don't have an offer yet if you just insert General AI tools it will give you a generic here the mises so if I go business coaches and I say so let's say I don't have a particular the offer I'll just put in this bit here General AI tools let's see what it gives us hey first name B andiron the way uplift business SS truly motivating notice how your power entrepreneurs s inspiring really impressive love your approach to coaching Business Leaders really impressive I've got these new tools that can seriously level up your coaching game curious to see how let's chat let's discuss further Etc so these are a good starting point you will need to modify them you'll notice that it is very informal it's like lowercase letterers sometimes it'll say what's up or yo these might not be right for your brand but in most cases these things have highest chance of coming off as a regular normal message not some kind of automated thing so they give you the highest chance of a response again it's definitely not one size for T but from T and ail who do this as a job these are the kind of short the happppy messages that are working best on Instagram as a disclaimer I would definitely refine these a little bit more I think they're a little bit cheesy that's kind of what the AI alut stath end up being but the message generator tool should give you the bones to sound a little more like you so I'm going to call this tutorial I'm going to save this I've saved the message template which is good then I can go to the tags and all throughout Auto agdm we have tutorials so if yet lost and important you want to learn more about the other features this thing has there's a whole bunch of tutorials here that you can watch so jump into those whenever you feel like it all the tags you'll see I've already created a tag here for scal systems I'll delete that for now tags are handy for tagging the conversation so that we know what kind of campaign it came from so in this case I'll put scaling with systems and I have that tagged here so now when I go over to Instagram and I go to auto igdm scaling with systems is already in here and I can check the tag to scaling with systems set the template and the messages to tutorial you want to check both of these only you means that you're contacting only people that you haven't contacted before and only messages needs to be turned on so that you don't follow them and then message them cuz you can be following on 1,000 of people a month so make sure both of these are checked and then we're ready to click Start give it a few seconds to boot up what it's going to do is take over another browser window as you can see here and in now hands off the keys we get to see it up in the top Corner a igdm has started debugging this browser now we're just going to go through that list and head our 10 per hour mot and continually do this so you can put this away in the background you can put it on another window you can just click play once every morning and then put it onto another window or another desktop and just leave it as you can see it's going to type in the message manually hi Grayson noticed how you Empower and entrepreneurs so inspiring I've got these AI tools that could seriously level up your coaching game so you can see it's behaving as if a human would which is why it's able to automate this rather than your account getting banned so the fact that it takes over the browser types this in one lit by L and not cut a program dramatically just spashes them all out is really the magic behind Auto igdm and how it allows you to send that 50 limit per day cap with no issues every single day so give it a second see it pauses for a little bit and then it sends a message and these overlays here show us what tag we've put on this conversation and this copy messages a little bit more of an advanced feature that I want to go into here and then we have it with turned on our automation you can see here that it has the delay between actions so it's just going to sleep the browser for 250 seconds and after the sleep period is done let's go to pull up the next account and send the DM as well so I always forgot uh we need to do on auto igdm here so if you go to the settings on the main page the recommended delay that I have got from sadar is it's either 150 to 350 or 200 to 400 and the maximum number of requests we can set to 50 per day so these settings here are recommended so this means that after it's finished messaging a person it will randomly pick between 150 and 350 seconds and it might be I don't know 240 4 minutes it's going to wait for 4 minutes to send the next message and that's really the magic of Auto igdm I'm now going to be sending 50 DM for day all I need to do is come on here each morning and click play and the automation will start and I can forget about it this is such a great way for beginners to get started all you need to get started but this messages an idea of who you want to reach out to and then you need to go and find accounts or find ways where you can find clusters of those kinds of people on Instagram this is really the most difficult part thinking outside the box here can really help in the past I've used things like modash which is an influencer search platform like Google for influencers and if you're struggling to find those key accounts like scaling with systems here for me again please don't go and bombard Roby and his followers they're probably a little bit out of your league anyway if you're just starting out but once you found an account that you can use to build your list then it's just getting those Outreach Messengers crafted and in this case you can use the tool just to get you started modified as you need but if you've been able to find that account that you can build your list off of then you just need to use something like the tool that I've provided here that again is available on the school that's going to allow you to generate some variations of Outreach messages work on those a bit if they're not converting well then you might need to go back to the drawing board and say hey am I takeing the right angle here for those big thinkers or those who are from the email World maybe thinking like 50 day it's like a drop in the ocean it's there's nothing compared to what I can do by email and things like this what Auto igdm allows you to do is to get on an agency plan where we can have multiple seats so you can see here the monthly price month to month is going to be five seats or 10 seats I know this might look like a lot of money but being out to see 250 DMS per day or even up to 500 is something that can really really make a difference in your business again I wouldn't be talking about it like this and I didn't think that Instagram Outreach like this wasn't an excellent way for beginners to be able to get their first AI agency clients and that's about it for the video guys if You' have enjoyed please hit down and leave a like on this video let me know if you want to see more videos like this focusing on how to get clients I know a lot of you guys have been asking me to do more on the client acquisition side of things so this is me making a conscious effort to try and put things in front of you talking about Instagram I have the other channels coming soon LinkedIn email Etc so if this is a particular part of your AI agency Journey that you're struggling with getting your clients you might have the skills that I talk about a lot in building things but the actual getting the client side of things I know it's difficult for some of you who are new to online business so if you're interested tomor of that stuff please of course subscribe to the channel so you don't miss the future ones like this talking about other platforms and also leave a like on the video if you have enjoyed and at least me know that you guys want to see more of these kind of videos in future and of course this video wouldn't have been possible without s Emil and the Omni Fusion AI team for building Auto igdm so it's a pleasure to have you guys in the community and for those of you who are going to be jumping in and giving this a spin for your agency we do have a discount code l i Liam that's going to get you 10% off so thank you to S Emil and the omn fusion team for that and if you guys want to followup video talk about how you can scale from 50 to 500 messages per day using Auto agdm I'm more than happy to do that and walk through the agency plan there's a little bit of uh technical stuff that you got to do in terms of proxies but wouldn't happy to do that so let me know Down Below in the comments if you're interested in learning how you can set up AI voice systems to automate your business and those of your clients you can check out my recent video here breaking that down step by step but aside from that that's all for the

              "text": "in this video we're exploring a groundbreaking new AI platform that no one is talking about meet zapia Central the next big thing in AI automation while recently all of the buzz has been about custom gpts zapia has been silently working away on their answer to open ai's agents and an answer that could mean trouble for the entire gpt's ecosystem but could zapia Central really be the future of how businesses adopt AI or is it just another stale automation platform that struggles to create real value for its users and more importantly if it's is any good how can you use it to boost your business or the businesses of your clients with AI well after diving into zapia Central over the past few days I have discovered that the zapia team is definitely onto something here so in this video I'll be breaking down what zapia central is and what makes it a potentially better alternative to open AIG gbts in many use cases then I'll be whooping up some live builds for you to demo some of these super simple yet stupidly powerful use cases that anyone can create on zapia Central and finally I'll be sharing with you how you can become one of the first experts on this new platform to boost both your business your client's businesses all regardless of your skill level if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I run my own AI development company called morning site Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world but I teach people how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the agents and automations you can create on zapia Central let's get into it first things first what is zapia Central well here on this site for Central they say that you're able to work hand inand with AI Bots the easiest way way I found to explain it is a mixture between gpts where you're able to interact with a conversational assistant or an agent and tell it what to do and then it can call Custom actions and and use knowledge Etc so you've got the knowledge you've got the actions you've got the prompting usual GPT stuff that we've talked about on this channel quite a lot but what zappy has done is a very interesting aspect of also including some of the sort of autonomous Automation and workflow automation steps that they've done on the platform prior so it's a unique combination of gpts mixed with a centralization of all of your zaps for a particular function if that doesn't make sense don't worry it was difficult for me to WRA my head around this initially but give me a few minutes and once we get into the demos it's going to make a lot more sense scrolling down here a bit the vision that they have for Central is the next step towards evolving automation for the AI AG Central puts you in the driver's seat to automate even more work with the help of our friendly AI Bots what central really is is a conversational layer that allows you to utilize all of the thousands and millions of possibilities that you can create with zap GE zaps and the Integrations they have with over 6,000 different apps so extremely exciting stuff here's a little bit of a demo you can connect live data so it's similar to knowledge for your gpts as you can see here add a data source there's Google Sheets as an option there's Google Docs and there's also notion the interesting thing about this that you're going to see in a second is that it is actually Dynamic so whatever the Google sheet is updated you're then going to have access to that updated data which is something we haven't really seen which is knowledge bases thata Dynamic and regularly updated to be update with the latest information live data is one part then we have the instructions or the prompting as we see here when they open this up there's an instructions tab which instructs your Bot on how to use the knowledge and also how to use the actions and finally they have what's called behaviors which are best understood as actions for custom gpts or tooling Etc this of course is directly integrated with all of zapia thousands of Integrations as you may have noticed these are the same three ingredients that I've been banging on about for the past couple of months and that if you can figure out this AI agent skill set which right now is knowing how to prompt knowing how to add data and knowing how to connect these tools the you're able to build AI agents on basically any of these platforms because it's the same skill set so I hope you've been paying attention and I hope you built up these skills of knowing how to prompt knowing how to connect different actions because it's the same process here tying all of these three aspects together into these AI agents that you can use internally in a business the biggest Advantage for zapia Central over gpts in my opinion especially for beginners is that there is no code included at all you don't have to add in these tools separately don't have to use a schema I'm sure if you've tried to get zap your actions to be put as custom actions for your gpts you'll know just how difficult that process can be so for this there is no code involved at all all you need to do is go on as it shows here click on create new Behavior give it some instructions set up a trigger and then set up what it's supposed to do and you're able to create these awesome powerful custom actions without ever having to write any code at all so down here they've got a little bit more stuff I think this allinone AI workspace is really the the key Point here is that it Con centralize all of your automations and AI features that you use throughout the business into one Hub which I guess is why they called it zapia central it's pretty pretty fitting title query data we been over that follow up these are the kind of backend automations you can set up that you'll see in a second Etc that hasn't got you excited about building a zapia central then the next section where we're going to jump into some live demos of building OD zappi Central will do the job so I can click on try Central today of course you need a zap your account for this once we're ENT Central we have this familiar kind of chat gbts interface and it immediately gives us a new Untitled bot and it tells us okay we can add behaviors we can add data sources a good starting point for us I think would be to show some of the live data and being able to chat to uh spreadsheets and and CSV data so if I add a data source go to a Google sheet it's connected by my email to all of my Google Sheets so super easy to do that now I've got this Sample Sales data that I've got off kaggle just to show you how even large data sets can be used and we can query our data sets to get some interesting insights to give you a quick look at the data uh there's a ton of stuff here there's the sales there's the quantity of orders there's the date most interestingly which I want to do a little bit of analysis over so see there's a lot of 2003 2004 dates let's give it a bit of a tricky question to analyze that information so I go uh can you get the sales by month for 2003 include a number of units sold and the total value month by month and what it's doing here similar to chat GPT is that it has its own code interpreter so as you can see it's actually converted the spreadsheet into a database and it's writing a database query on this uh this is some really impressive stuff and it's being kind of a fantasy for a long time of being able to convert a spreadsheet into a database and now we're writing SQL queries going from text to SQL I'm sorry I'm getting a little bit nerdy here but it is very impressive what they've been able to do here with converting it to a database and now we can query the database and get some really powerful insights so here you can see the output of the data retrieved and then it's using that data to write the answer so here we can see uh the data for 2003 month by month unit sold and total sales value so very very cool stuff already now can say can you compare that month by month 2 2004 EEG Jan 2003 this jan4 now this capability alone to set for a business being able to chat to their spreadsheets in a way that's very Dynamic and can pull in literally Dynamic data as it gets added to the spreadsheet is an awesome new use case and I really recommend you guys jump in and have a play around with this because this is something that businesses have been wanting to do for a long time and having it put on a PL like this for us is some awesome news for beginners and Pros alike and here we can see again it's written a query for the database it's created for our spreadsheet it's done it perfectly it's comparing the 2003 values month by month with the 2004 value so Dynamic spree cheet datas added as a knowledge base is so much better than the knowledge bases we have for gpts I'm sure you have tried to put a CSV data or tried to put some spreadsheet data as a knowledge document for your gpts and it's just absolutely terrible at at using that data because it doesn't have a system setup like this to be able to create a database out of it and then query the database and use that intelligently in the answer that's how we can chat to spreadsheets with Dynamic data which is cool enough and then we have the typical chat to documents in the same way that you'd uploaded a document to a knowledge base but again it's going to be dynamic so if I go to Google Docs and I select a Google doc here if I go maybe the support documentation for ailm would be a pretty good one for this because if I update the support documentation I don't have to go in and redownload it and re-upload it into my agent it's just going to automatically do that so I can get my team to go in there modify the support documentation it's necessary add new question and answers and FAQs and it's going to automatically be pulled through to zapia central here interestingly this brings us to some of the quirks of this platform and its current form as you can see here I've uploaded the information I've said how do I change my ail and password which is included in the support documentation just in order to change your password however it's not developed by zapia and it just starts making it up based off its existing training date this standard chat interface is not very useful in many ways and in order to get it to do the things you want to do in many cases you'll have to go create behavior and say answer questions from the K Liam for document provided then if I go to trigger and go when I message the bot add the trigger turn that on and now if I go I for to my AI password finally after a pretty long wait I can click onto this thread and see that it has gone through and Ed the code block to select the document first of all and then to answer the question from the information in the document it doesn't quite work how you'd expect it in these simple use cases but I believe from my plan around this is set up this way so that if when you have tons and tons of documents like 20 or 30 of them included this system of using a a look up and and looking up in the database to find the specific documentation file that you're looking for or the the the knowledge based document You' provided it's going to actually look that up first and then put it into this thread so when the actions are performed this is the interesting part where you combined a regular GPT Style with I think what Zapp is trying to do which is this threading style and so now I can conversate back and forth within this thread and ask questions about my document and I'm going to get the answers in there for dynamic knowledge bases you can also connect notion here I have had some issues with getting it to answer correctly so I think there might be a few bugs um but I'm sure they'll buff those out in no time here I've made a bot called my notion resistant and what I want to do is set up some behavior in this create a behavior instructions are a good place to start so I could say create a new notion page when I say create a new notion page ask me for the content for the page but come up with a page title yourself that represents the content appropriately and so now usually you'll be getting suggestions here I'm not sure why it's not suggesting me this can be a little bit confusing but just stick with me here so when I message the bot is the trigger then I want to use my phrase here oh which was create a new notion page so I can provide a specific keyword or phrase that I want to trigger this action create a new notion page I want to add that as a trigger and then I want to create a new page so here's my suggestions here that's nice the parent page have the AI select this so this is really the magic of of zapy central which you'll see a bit more on a bit but we have the title I want the AI to generate the field for the value and I also want it to cover with the content based off my input so that's all set up I can test the Behavior now it's going to open up a thread here to proceed with creating a notion page I need to know what content you'd like to include in the page here you can see it's triggered this is the test trigger that it's just inserted the phrase that I've included in the setup let's jump back to my spreadsheet chat one and I want to put this data into a new notion page see if it copies across okay so I to go back into the thread here oh let's see how it goes with that we got a little bit of a bug here where it didn't actually send me a reply normally it will send back the link to the notion page itself uh but I followed up and it seems like it's already created it so sure enough over on my notion it has created this it's given the title itself that it's generated based off the content and I've got an ocean page so maybe it was because it was in the testing environment if I tried again create a new noce page try it again without the testing environment now it's going to pick it up create another thread and see it started talking about some some random stuff here that's because I didn't come here and switch the action on that's my bad apologies and if I want to call this again and try to get it to properly create the notion page create a new thread for me hello seems to be bugging out here let me refresh the page Maybe little modification here I've just changed it to say trigger when I say create a new notion page so if I go create a new notion page there we go so make sure in this you use trigger it seems to be the keyword that gets it to work well so trigger when I say create a new notion page now it's going to be asking me in the thread for the content I want to include let's grab the sales data again head back to notion assistant go on to our thread and paste it in it should give me the confirmation message that it's created the page successfully propose page title now it's going to create the notion page please hold on for a moment and it's performing the action as expected there we go if we drop this down it has included all the information that it used to create it and it provides us a link to the report here so if I click on this can open up my ocean and there we have it strange thing is that it's kind of just putting it anywhere I think if I go in here it's down here and this one is inside the the other one I just did so back here if we look at the notion create page I can't even modify what the parent page is here so it's not perfect by any means but it does show you that this is a GPT style experience with these thread mechanics that allow you to set up certain behaviors to happen Upon A Certain phrase being sent this particular human in the loop style interaction with the assistants is not all zap Central does it's intended to combine both the GPT style where you are interacting with your agent with your typical background workflow automations that you set up on zapia which might be triggered by some action like a slack message or a Google sheet row added in so here's an example I've been working on just having a play around scratching my own itch with this stuff is a school control Center I have my free school community and I thought why to try to create some kind of central hub for managing it and put zapu Central to the test so I have a uh a link to a spreadsheet that is synced 8 minutes ago so it's actively resyncing the data so I'm always able to ask questions about my school Community but more interestingly is I've been able to set up some Behavior where when someone tries to join my school Community a new robot added to the spreadsheet that it's watching and that is the trigger no longer am I having to ask a message to my assistant to trigger it it's able to use a traditional zapia trigger and then I'm getting it to send an action after that which is to send a direct message and the magic of zapia central is that the AI itself as I said is a layer on top that can connect all of these things so the instructions here will tell the AI how to autofill the rows so as you can see here for message text I need to generate some kind of message that I want to send to myself on slack but what I'm telling it bya instructions is when a new row is created send a slack message to me that is a one- sentence summary of the new members details if I go over to my slack here you'll see that zapia has been sending me messages and these one sentence summary obviously I'm going to have to blur these out but I promise you that there are one sentence summaries as I told it to over on zapia centroids triggering the automation based on a row being added and then it's using the AI in the instruction to determine how it fills out the rest of it so it's like this magical glue that can stick your automations without having to get this direct lining up and matching up of the inputs from one to another and as I said this combines the conversational aspect that we're used to with gbts with these kind of background and autonomous automations so if I go to while I was away we had 17 runs now I get to see everything that's been happening in the background of my school Community while I've been asleep while I've been away I can keep tabs on all of the automations that are firing I can set up new ones another cool thing you can do is go to create Behavior I can set a trigger to schedule so if I want to schedule something that I want done every week which might be to look at all of the spreadsheet RADS that have come in and all the new members that have tried to join and do some analysis and then send the analysis via email to whoever or to send it in here there's so much cool stuff that can be done now they we'll be able to combine both the human and the loop aspect of AI agents and talking to them and telling them what to do with these backend and and background automations that's really the magic of what zapia has done here with Central and I'm a big fan there are a few limitations that the platform suffering from I think the conversational aspect of pulling in context from the threads and answering questions correctly I think there's still a lot of work to be done there it is quite slow I've had to obviously cut it out for this video but some days I've been sitting here for 30 seconds or more waiting for it to to trigger in action or something like that there's definitely room for improvement on the speed side but this is quite clearly intended to be an internal use kind of platform and tool for managing your systems managing your operations managing the different departments and centralizing like the school example so centralizing everything to do with my free community all the automations all the reporting all the questions I want to have over the data I have really really cool way of centralizing things it's not so much as we've been familiar with with other agents of maybe creating a GPT and deploying it somewhere putting it out on an Instagram Channel or putting it on WhatsApp and things like this because it doesn't have to be interacting with customers I think the speed can kind of be forgiven if you're using it internally for now so not tearable but could definitely be better and one thing that would make this a lot more powerful is being able to visualize the data it's currently not able to like chat gbt use the code interpreter to generate a graph and so when I was looking at the data I would have lik to see the 2003 line against the 2004 line it's a lot more easy to understand and do data analysis when you can actually visualize it as well so I'm sure they've got that on the road map but it doesn't have that right now now that we know there zapia Central has got some pretty cool stuff going on the question is where does it fit into the the AI automation landscape how can we adopt it how can we include it in our own businesses how can we use it and sell it to our clients to me I think zapia central is going to play a key role in the space in a number of ways firstly it is completely remove the need to code in order to create these AI agents we used to have that integration step up okay have a a custom action or have an API that I want to put onto my GPT as a custom tool or a custom action and there was this ugly open API scheme thing that beginners had to do that wasn't very bitor friendly in many ways what zapia centralist enabled us to do is to directly hook into all of zapia apps and and the actions and triggers that you can use seamlessly no code not a single line of code has been written this could really be the democratization of AI agents in many ways that now people can come in without any coding background and they can start to build these things either for their own businesses or sell building them as a service to other people as well and when you factor in that zapia is making major moves on things like zapia tables for storing data they have zapier interfaces they have zap canvas as well their ecosystem is growing at a rapid rate and this means if you are someone who's looking to get into AI or building these kind of automation systems and beginning to make money by by making businesses better with them zapia may be a interesting opportunity for you to focus on just one ecosystem there is so much available in this AI space right now if you're an AI agency or you're a freelancer just picking one platform like zapia and saying look they've got so much stuff I'm just going to specialize in that that could be a great place to start especially if you're a beginner and you want to utilize no code tools as as much as possible so if what you've seen today seems interesting at all I highly recommend you go on to zap PA Central and check it out try to build just one thing and the best way to learn this at least in my experience is to scratch your own itch try to build something that's handy for you in your own life or for a friend or for your parents or something just try to find a a use case that you can apply this tool to help make your life better and that aha moment might just be the thread that you end up pulling to a particular career in this AI autovation space I'm super excited to see what kind of stuff you guys are building on zapia Central and being out of find better use case than I have so far so what I'm going to do is on my free school Community if you're not already a member there will be a link to join in the description I'm going to make a post related to this video that is on the topic of zapia Central and if you want to head over there we're going to be talking and going deep on all the cool features and use cases that we're able to create with it my free school Community is kind of the hub for AI automation agencies and you being able to identify Solutions and and really be around other people who are interested in making the most of this AI opportunity so that sounds interesting you can join the school in the description below excited to see what you guys can build with this if you're exced deed to get stuck into zapy essential and have got something out of this video please hit down below and leave a like on it um really supports me to continue making fre videos like this and of course if you want to stay up to date regarding future updates on zapia Central how to build gpts and other tips and tricks that I'm finding for you to make money and build businesses in the AI space be sure to subscribe while you're down there so that you don't miss any of my future videos if you're interested in learning how to start an AI business in 2024 I've just released a full guide an hour and a half long that I highly recommend you watching here but aside from that guys that's all for the video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be giving you a super quick tutorial on how you can create custom tools for your gbts and for your AI agents without writing any code this method is using make.com and connecting them to your gbt via a whip hook and just using a super simple prompt template to create the open API schema that you need to connect them right so jumping into it the no code platform you're going to be building your tools on is of course make.com I've talked about this a lot on the channel before it is my personal favorite automation platform and I think it's got a a really good graphical editor so that you can drag it around very and friendly but also allows you to get really good at it over time and build some very very complex things so the skill you're about to learn now is going to be not only valuable for you gbts but also in how you can use make.com to automate workflows and sell their services to other people as well so make.com be a linked down below if you you can't type in make.com if that's a struggle um but you want to create an account and I'm going to log into mine here and then what we want to do is create a new scenario up here now that we have our new scenario we can head over and go to the chat gbt site and we can create a new GPT and sort of lay the for what we're going to connect to this so you get a little bit more context on what we're doing here so explore gpts you'll need chat GPT plus to do this $20 a month we're going to create a new gbt I'm going to call this an email assistant so the example I'm going to use in this tutorial is allowing us to send emails from our gbt using an automation that we put on make so first we'll go in here um sends emails for us via make.com custom action um when the user asks you to send an email the the sin email operation so that's the custom action we're referring to that we're going to put in in second that's a technical name that open AI uses for a tool or custom action so use to send email operation um and ask the user for the email of the recipient and the email message then figure out the subject line yourself so that should be it we want this conversation started to be send email I send an email so now that we've got the bones laid there you know what we're going to be building we can head over to Let's like get a little bit of a an image going here I always feel like it isn't complete until You' put an image on it so now we can H back to make and we can actually lay this thing out so first thing is going to be a web hook this is going to be how our uh GPT can actually interact with our make.com scenario scenario is what this whole kind of like automation is called and make so we want to click a custom web hook here and we want to add a new web hook I'm going to call this U make tutorial or gpts you can call it whatever you want probably something to do with the gbt that you're creating and then we're going to go okay and then we want to add another module in this case as I said we're going to be doing a send an email capability if we want to go Gmail uh send an email you can see that we have three Fields here this so this is the information that we need to capture from our user or fill in some of of them ourselves as you saw in the prompt I said for the subject line don't expect the user to provide that we can figure it out I want the gbt to figure it out from the content and the message we need to get the email and the content from the user and the gbt is going to figure out the subject so in order to get the information in here as you can see here we need to be able to put some kind of variable in here right we need to have some some placeholders that have taken it from the we hook and place it in there but I won't be able to get that information until we've done a test fire we need to test fire this web Hook from our GPT here there we go nice picture so in order to do that we need to create our open API schema and add it in as a custom action down here I want to give a quick shout out to Chris lanon here it was actually this video that I saw that gave me the idea for this video so thank you Chris you beat me to it by about 3 months I think and in this video Chris shared a gbt action schema Creator which we're going to use in this video which I found is quite helpful and there's also a template for a make.com open API scheme that we're going to be using as well so Chris thank you for the work that you put into this I appreciate and my community does as well so in here we can say create me a schema it's going to ask me for a bunch of information and we can sort of shortcut it here I say here is the template I'm using and now going back to what I mentioned we want to include in the schema that we need these three Fields so two subject and content if I go back one I want to copy this while we're at it copy this we want to bring this over uh we can say here is my web hook URL here are the inputs this uh tool requires and then you put in the inputs of reent email address uh subject line email body so those are the three things that the Gmail is requiring and this is the webbook URL and what it's basically going to do is look through uh this template we've got and replace things like okay what's the summary of the action okay what's parameter one in this case it'll be the recipient email address parameter 2 is going to be for the subject line and parameter 3 is going to be for the email body so if we enter this let's go and modify that to our needs and you can take the same process a link to Chris's GPT here and also the template included will be available at my free resource Hub on school so if you're not already a member of my school it's a free community we can get all the resources that are attached to my videos more importantly engage in the discussion and be in the loop on all the AI solutions that my community is selling successfully to business owners really just get closer to the action in terms of the AI space of people who are Tred to build businesses and make money so if you're not already a member of the school Community it's down there it's free um and on there if you go to the YouTube tab there'll be a post for this video and in it will be a link to the GPT action schema Creator here and also the template so you can continue to reuse that use the same kind of structure that I just provided where you can paste the template in you provide your make.com webblog URL and then you provide the inputs that are necessary and then it will generate you the schema for it oh it's giving me a bit of back chat here what I like to do is add to the bottom of this um fill in and the rest of the Fe field yourself as best as possible and modify this template to use the URL and inputs I've Pro provided I didn't really tell her what to do there so there we have our webook URL being filed operation ID is called send email good first parameter is recipient email yep the second parameter is subject line and the third one is email body might help you debug these in future if you know how to read them a little bit so we have the name of the operation um and the parameters that we expect as inputs now we can take this copy it head back to rgbt paste it in and because we're using a make webook we don't need to do any authentication so this is why I particularly like this method for beginners cuz authentication can get a little bit tricky in writing these schemers as well so what we can do now is hit back I like to give it a refresh just to make sure it's properly set up and then we can click on send an email here and what we need to do is determine the data structure within make we haven't filled in these variables yet with placeholders that's because we need to call this first and we need to send some real data to this webook so that it knows what to expect and we can use them as variables with then make sounds complicated but I promise it's not uh all we need to do here is say okay set the two field it's trying to call the toia it's asking for the email address and the message we like to send the two Mike at gmail.com message um you the bomb man I miss you so much why you know before I hit enter on that I want to go back to the webook I want to click redetermined data structure make sure that's make sure that's underway and then I send this it's going to ask me to approve the action yep so it's starting to try and send and communicate with our web hook then I want to we can see it's trying to send to mik Gmail subject line missing you which it's figured out which is great and the email body so if I allow and I go back this should change to successfully determine data structure which is exactly what we want give it a second boom successfully determined and that means that make has gone okay this structure that you sent I now know what to expect and I can give you these to use within make so this is really the key step and it can be difficult for beginers sometimes but I hope that it's been simple enough I've had to refilm this once just to make sure I do a little bit clearer so the email has been sent we're all good back over here now we have the information that's arrived within make I'm going to save it sometimes I need to play around with this a little bit but if you refresh it it should have loaded in and we can use it within our Gmail and then we can give this one final test and we're all done sometimes you have a bit of issue with the variables popping up like this so these aren't popping up for you um easy fix that I found is if you can unlink these unlink the two and then you just click on the Run once it's going to be waiting waiting waiting and I can just say say uh let's send email again and it's going to send some live data again give it a second and there should be a little tick in a second and this has come through uh we can see that we've got the data that's come through all good here and now when we connect these up I click on this and go there we go subject line we can fill that in content is email body add a recipient recipient email and now we have mapped the variables from the input that out tool is expecting from the inputs that it's taking from the gbt and it successfully mapped it in that it can easily slide those variables from the WEP directly into the Gmail so once that's all set up I'm going to turn this scheduling on me go back a step save the changes so now with the scheduling on this means this is awaiting any new data with anything in make that has this lightning bolt it fires as soon as new data comes in so as soon as that we Pok is fired by a GPT it's going to run that process again so now I can get my phone out and I can give this a proper test if I go save I'm going to make this a little private one I'm going to view it on the big screen and I go send an email I'm going to get my phone out see if I can get an email from myself go to my Gmail app here and if I go to send an email to and say hey hey man what H happened to our meeting did you change the time from Greg okay so we give that a second oh and if we go back to here we should see that it pinks it fires we're going to always allow it talk to the hook boom boom so these little bubbles mean that it's done something so receed the information here and then it sent the email off here from Etc sent it off and up here if I refresh meeting time inquiry and I've got my email there as expected so that's how you can integrate a make.com scenario as a tool this is something I wanted to introduce to you Bo because I know many of you use make from watching my videos makes a great thing you can do some really complex automations on here um so once you built up your skills on M you can transfer those over to creating custom tools for your GP and as someone who doesn't know how to code or you're not really too familiar with building your own custom tools this can be a great way to not only build them and a fairly simple system for connecting them via a schema as it doesn't require any fancy authentication so this system that I just showed you here of providing the inputs providing the webook URL asking it to modify the template again all of this will be on my free resource Hub and thank you to Chris for the information that he shared and this GPT in particular so that's about all for the video let me know down below if you found this helpful I definitely did and I'll be using this in some my future videos but aside from that if you're interested in learning the easiest way that I've found to use pre-made tools and connect them to your gbt so that you don't even need to do the building step I've just done a complete video on the appify platform here which is great for using pre-built tools using other people's hard work so highly recommend you watch that aside from that guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

newbie in this video I'll be walking you through how to find tools on appify and how to connect them to your gbts in seconds and at the end of the video I'll be showing you a real world use case gpts built using appify tools so you can understand the kind of value that can be unlocked when they're combined together correctly if you're new to the channel don't know who I am my name is Le Motley I run my own AI development company called morning son Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world but I teach people how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the gbts and AI agents you can create using the tools on things like appify let's get into it so what is appify as I mentioned it is a Marketplace for finding tools well in this case it's apis but for us as GPT developers and people who are building AI agents it is essentially a Marketplace for tools what makes applify particularly powerful for us is that they have a button that allows us to immediately export any of these API tools that other third party developers have gone and created and putting time and effort into managing and and making sure that they work properly as you'll see shortly there's a ton of really awesome and valuable use cases that they've already created with prepackaged apis that we can use but by coming on here we're able to leverage the hard work of other people and instantly connect them into our gbts to add function ity that normally we would have had to build ourselves and we' have to use other apis or untrustworthy unreliable ones but what we have with appify is kind of like a Premium Selection of working and high quality tools that we can easily integrate into our gpts without having to do it ourselves appify is probably the best news I've seen in a long time for beginners who are looking to get into the AI space as we know I talk about AI agents a lot on the channel and the three ingredients that are kind of identified of prompting knowledge and actions and in this case actions are tools knowledge and probing fairly easy to do but the tooling is really where the magic happens and can be quite difficult for beginners to build their own or create their schemas and integrate them into their gpts what appify will allow you to do as a beginner is come on and just browse around and start to build some experience of integrating tools into your gpts which is what I'm going to show you how to do in the next section so if you are a complete beginner to is just tinkering to sort of get the ball rolling on your GPT building career or or Journey or you're an AI agency owner or developer who wants to integrate the hard work of other people into your tools to speed up the delivery and reduce costs on your end there's something on appify for everyone so let's jump into it here we are on ay.com they can probably do a better job of explaining themselves on their homepage here than I can a lot of the use cases around web scraping and packaging them up into web scraping is is difficult often times for for regular people like you and I because the websites are changing all the time and you need proxies and you need this and that all of this is packaged up into actors that you can basically rent the hard work of other people and setting up these systems so a lot of the stuff we're going to see shortly is based around web scraping and pulling new data into your gpts without having to do all the hard work yourself there'll be a link down below or you can just search up apif fy. comom I'm not affiliated with these people in any way they have not re out to me I simply was recommended this by my CTO Spencer who said hey this could be cool for the community and here I am letting you guys know so no affiliation just think this could be really powerful for you guys and a great thing for beginners in particular so you can click here to sign up for free I already have an account then we get into appify we see a couple things on the left here we have store actors schedules storage proxy let's go through these quickly and give you a little orientation on the storage we can brows for actors which is the the terminology they use on the platform so each one of these is an actor um let's find one down here say we go um Instagram profile Instagram profile scraper so instead to try to build an Instagram profile scraper yourself or use some dodgy one anywhere else on the internet you can come on here and use these premium tools that are 99% run succeeding and they're being used by hundreds or thousands of people regularly there's quite a lot of stuff going on here as you can see but basically this uh this input allows you to test it so if we put my Instagram in follow me on Instagram if you're not already and we run it see what we get back goes into this actors and run section so this will display the run and the result to it when it's done that only took 9 seconds and it pulled on my profile information so pretty cool very easy to do but the magic here is if I wanted to take this Instagram profile scraper and include it into my GPT as a tool that is super simple to do I can come to my actors here or you can do it from the store page as well but if I click on this and I go up to API and click on open API specification now this may look familiar to you but yes we can just copy and paste this directly over into a GPT so if I go to chat. open.com and I go up to the top left yes you do need to have a chat GPT premium account or plus whatever they call it um to create gpts but if I go to the explore gpts tab on the left and go create a new GPT we just call it IG data analyst and we can go and set up this tool immediately heading back to appify here we can copy this and one click paste it in here oh and you can scroll down you can see appify Instagram profile scraper the tool is registered correctly now we need to do one final step which is to go to the settings button here API key and we need to head back to appify and get our API key if we go to our settings here and we go to Integrations you'll see your personal API token I'm going to copy mine head back to chat gbt paste in the API key click on Bearer click okay and now this tool should be all ready to go if I go back give it a little bit of information you can fch IG profile data and compare and contast profiles with your IG Prof profile scraper tool contrast profile there uh so now if we give it a little uh give it a picture here and I say compare the limle and instagr profile see how I stack up to the big man Drake here so it's looking to run it on myself and on Drake confirm that and just like that we're successfully calling our appify tool within our GPT and not only as it doing it once it's able to do it multiple times and intelligently call these tools over and over and over again and this is just one tool you'll see a little bit later when I show you the real word use case that I've come up with using only IDE tools you can combine multiple tools and it can sort of call them all back to back and provide some really cool and Powerful uh use cases and and outputs For You Drake has a significantly larger following with over 146 million compared to Liam watley's 10,800 well uh we kind of knew how that was going to go but that shows you how you can easily connect you just come over here API key I'd save this somewhere in your notes once you've on any actor you can click on the API section here open API specification copy this and then put in your authentication as well once you get over to jgpt one thing you may be thinking now is okay how much does all this cost if I'm honest I don't fully understand the the pricing structure of this app just yet cuz yes on one hand you can see here uh there's a starter play $49 a month it's 49 Inay as you go it's got all these kind of technical terms in terms of how much RAM and CPUs and proxies and stuff you get don't worry if that's confusing cuz it goes way over my head as well but from what I understand there's these appify based ones or usage based ones where it's a lot more affordable based on the usage that you do so for example here $5 per th000 video scraped that's great it's pretty good rates but if you go to something something like YouTube channel scraper free for one day and then $35 a month so I would recommend shopping around there's there's other people who can make the same tool so it might not be exactly the same but if you can avoid paying $35 a month plus usage um then I'd recommend trying to find the the free or at least usage only based alternative cuz I know you guys don't want to be spending too much money on these so I forget to put a lot of the stuff into production apps so I'll let you know as soon as I have some more data on how much this thing is costing me at scale so now to tit all together I want to show you what powerful and useful example that I've created for my own business and for my own workflows uh that's only using appify tools so this should give you an idea of what these things can can create when they're stacked on top of each other and used and set up in the right way so my idea here is a YouTube co-pilot as you can see here on the store there's a lot of YouTube related scrapers so I thought to myself what are some interesting ways I could tie these together to make some kind of useful insights or analytics or or ideation service and GPT so what I came up with was using these actors here I have the uh YouTube scraper which is going to allow me to uh search YouTube and scrape the videos that come out so if I search voice flow it's going to give me the videos that would have come out of that YouTube search so this in particular allows me to research around topics programmatically if I go back I have a another YouTube scraper here that is going to take in my channel URL and pull my most recent videos and what we need that for is because I want to have a YouTube comment scraper tool as well that once I get the most recent videos from my channel I can scrape all of the comments ments and analyze them for video ideas for feedback to better understand what you guys want out of me on this channel and what you're really enjoying the most so I think this is something I've wanted to do for a while um and automating this through a GPT and through using these tools is something I'm pretty interested in doing so YouTube channel scraper and YouTube search scraper I've tied these all together into a YouTube co-pilot I've done some prompting here which you can see here using my perfect prompt writer which is a relevance tool that I've created this is available on my school community so if you're creating AI agents or gbts and you want to use my perfect prompt like this Abal this to give me pretty much the exact outputs that I want and allows me to make little tweets after that this is available on my free school community so if you haven't already signed up again it's free you can go down and there'll be a YouTube resource in the little YouTube tab related to this video and this will be included on the post for this video now in here the tricky part with this is that if we're combining multiple tools together as you can see down here I have in the tool section I have three of them I have the YouTube search and scrap so that's a searching tool we have the YouTube channel scraper and we have the video comment scraper when you're on appify over here if I just get the YouTube comment scraper I can't put multiple uh open AI specifications for the same URL in here so if you go back to our tools you'll see if I try to add another action here and I put in another appify action separately from the existing appify one here then it will tell you that you're not allowed to set up separate actions for the same uh tool provider so in this case what you have to do it's a little bit annoying but if we go to chat gbt and I go to the YouTube comment scraper I need to integrate all of these together uh combine all of these scheme specifications together right the entire thing do not admit any parts for prity I need the complete division to copy and here we can paste in the three different schemer so I go one there go back um that was the comment scraper the YouTube scraper here copy this again hit back paste it in and then I need to get the third one YouTube scraper copy this and hit back finally put it in there now this will take quite a while cuz these things get quite long so I'm going to leave this for a couple minutes and I'll get back to you and chbt tries to get lazy a lot of the time and it will try to not give you the full thing so here you can see me again trying to say look I need the whole thing don't leave anything out so this is a little bit awkward uh chat gbt 4 refused to do the whole thing and kept getting lazy and saying look just include the rest of it yourself so went over to to clae 3 and was able to write me the entire thing um now I'm not sure what that means if you have access to clae 3 I'm I think I'm pay $20 a month for this as well and it's been able to write the whole thing as I asked for it um so I'm going to copy this over this is only really an issue for really really large ones when you combine multiple tools together chbt seems to do it okay for one or two but with three I really wanted to get everything included in this so fingers crossed we have all three excellent and I've already set up my authentication here before so now I just need to go back I'm going to fill in one more conversation starter here so that I can use both the tools super easy and then I can go uh find video ideas in my comments as you can see down here I've given instructions on how it should perform the particular tasks I have the tools the incomod requests to expect and this one F video ideas on my comments is linked to this conversation starter and I've given instructions on first you need to scrape the five most recent videos from my channel here's the link then use the video scraper tool on each of those URLs then analyze those for video ideas based on the most common requests and the most liked comments so you can take a little read of that there in terms of how I've inst structed it to use these tools one after another okay so it took a little while but here is the output what it has done is called the first tool of my channel URL to get my recent videos and then it has gone to the next step of trying to get the comments from all those videos now it has tried to stuff them all in at once and pretty quickly realized that there's far too much information that can come back we had an issue here with the response is too large and then what it did because I prompted it to try again with single URLs it's gone through and sent just a single URL off to get the comments done that a couple times on different videos and then it's given me a breakdown of video ideas and why based on that data so well this just using two tools I haven't even shown you the other one I don't think I will cuz it might make this video a little too long but this shows you how you can use multiple tools okay I want you to find video ideas in my comments here's my channel URL get the videos now use another tool on that and use it over and over and over again to get cool insights like this people want an in-depth guide on gbts and agents why because a comment had 90 likes on it they want an advanced guide on creating custom gbts and tools because there's several comments across different videos in the at desire for that tutorial so hope this shows you a bit of the process of how you can integrate multiple appli tools into the same schema using CLA or using chat GPT and combining them into a GPT that can use them to chain together these responses and create really cool outcomes for yourself or for your clients if you guys want to ever play around with this YouTube co-pilot example yourself I'll put the prompt and I'll put my open API schema on the school community on the resource for this video so you can get that you can get my perfect prompt writer as well all available on my free school community so my final thoughts on appify I'm extreme excited to see what minie beginners and even Advanced GPT creators and AI agency owners can do with these kind of resources myself and my team at warning side are definitely going to be looking on appify for tools depending on the projects that come across our dis so as I said I'll let you know what the price Stacks up to once we put these into production for our clients but I think it's great for AI agency owners I think it's great for beginners to be able to start creating gpts and seeing the magic it's really that aha moment where you are able to go on this find a tool come up with an idea like this YouTube co-pilot put it all and see it work its magic in front of you and that's what I'm really excited for you guys to be able to get this kind of feeling without needing to know how to code and doing all the the hard work of creating your own tools so I won't ramble on for too much longer thank you guys so much for watching if this has been helpful please sit down below and leave a like on the video let me know if you want to see more videos like this got a bunch more videos coming on how you can create AI agents and gpts so if you want to stay in the loop on how you can build skills and build businesses with those skills in the AI space and make sure that you subscribe to the channel and you don't miss any of my future content leave a comment Down Below on any of the Cool Tools that you're looking looking to use if you're interested in seeing how you can build an AI system toall your leads automatically like I set up for my own company morning side you can watch that video up here but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

to responses on our website contact form and after seeing the explosion of these AI voice platforms recently I knew there had to be a bit away so in this video I'll be showing you exactly how I was able to set up an AI bot that automatically calls my leads hey Liam this is Emma from morning side Ai and tries to book and a discovery Rec them if they meet my criteria and at the end of the video I'll be showing you how to set this up in your business or in your client's business step by step using my plug and play template but how good are these systems really do they actually sound like a human do clients and customers get pissed off when they're called by them and most importantly are they able to effectively convert leads into paying customers that's exactly what we're going to be investigating in this video if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I run my own AI development company morning site AI I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world I teach people how to make money selling AI Solutions to businesses just like the AI calling system you're about to see in this video if you want to make the most of this AI opportunity be sure to subscribe to the channel down below so that you don't miss any of my future content teaching you how to build businesses and make money with AI if you're new to the whole AI voice thing I'll give you a quick rundown now on the current state of the industry and the kind of options we have as AI agency owners or as business owners to adopt these kind of AI systems as they currently are they are definitely not in their current form right now but we are starting to see different platforms that are allowing people like us to come on and build a powerful AI voice Sy assistant either as inbound AI calling systems where people can ring a number and a AI will answer for example if you are a restaurant and you wanted to replace your front of house staff having to answer the phone you can now create an AI agent on some of these platforms like the one I'm going to show you today and you can put it as the as a person to answer phone call every time it rings and it's going to allow customers to interact with this AI agent learn more about the business these are a few things that you can help the customer with here's a knowledge base that you can answer questions from Etc super handy use case so that's inbound calling people calling into a phone line and an AI picks up and then we have outbound AI calling systems which open up a ton of cool use cases as well for example if you're a business and you want to do Co calling at scale you can set up an AI outbound caller to ring a bunch of businesses with Co calling you have to be careful because you're not allowed to call Consumers but you are allowed to call call businesses so if you have a list of business leads that you're able to contact and and pass through to your AI Al calling system that's one way of generating leads as a business you can have things like re-engagement campaigns we have a list of leads and you want to call all of them and let them know about a new offer that your business has that's one way you can use these systems you can send out customer surveys via phone and to say hey this is an automated line but we'd love to hear some feedback from you on your recent purchase and in this video we're going to be building a basic but handy outbound calling system to immediately follow up with leads and get calls booked in if they meet your criteria to show you this kind of system in action we can jump on the computer now and I'll show you on my website morning side AI how we have this thing set up so if I go to the Le talk button as I said we have a customer contact form here here before I set up the system we definitely didn't have the most efficient way of handling leads that came in uh VI this contact form uh my business partner would have to check daily he said it's been about 30 minutes reading and going through them and and kind of classifying them as good or bad leads um and then it's been another 30 minutes a day he said on actually replying to them and conversating with leads um maybe from a week or two ago just trying to conversate with them to get to a point where he's ready to hop on a call with them and then on top of that he also had to get on these calls and determine if they are good fit and my CTO fence would have to get on and when we calcul how much time we're spending on this each week and applied an AI rate to it we're wasting around $2,000 per week so what I've got set up here and what you're going to be able to set up for your business by using these AI outbound calling systems is going to save us a lot of time and money so a little demo here if I go subject so just filling this out in the chatbot and here's the phone I'm using a Skype number here because the system can currently only call the US numbers um I'm using a a Skype number so that I can call myself which will get on my phone here in a second if you want to set one of these up and test it yourself you can again use a Skype number 10 to20 need a chat bot now if I send this and give it a second getting a call hey Liam this is Emma from war side AI hello hey there how's it going you just filled out our contact form so I'm following up with you do you have a couple of minutes to answer some questions about your AI project and yes I'm an AI assistant if you couldn't tell yeah sure awesome thanks for taking the time can you tell me a b bit about your business like the industry you're in and the size of your company um I'm in the Dead collection industry and I have 10 people working for me got it debt collection industry with a team of 10 people thanks for sharing that now could you give me an outline of the AI solution you're interested in getting built for your business uh we just want a customer support chat bot for our website um we're currently wasting a lot of time and resources really on on meding customer support I see so you're looking for a customer support solution for your website to streamline your processes and save time that's a great idea right now we're only accepting projects that can be built and delivered on our own platform agenes we do this to greatly reduce the development hours required for these kinds of projects and we pass on the savings to you is this project a chat lot of some sort yep sure is great in that case I'll email you a link to book a call with Josh Liam's business partner and coo here at Morning Tide he'll have more questions about your project and we'll be able to determine the feasibility and rough costs to get you the result you're after just give me a moment to send that email is there a specific email address you'd like me to use yep it's perfect I'll send the email to you should receive it shortly with the link to book a call with Josh well I'm really excited to hear how your call goes with him he'll be able to provide more insights and guidance for your project if you have any other questions or need further assistance feel free to reach out have an awesome rest of your day cheers bik so breaking that down quickly we have a call all that comes immediately as soon as they fill out the form and then what it's going to do is ask a couple questions collect a bit of information but the key thing that you may have heard is the qualification step now qualifying leads and determining which ones go through to getting a discovery call is a key and and really valuable function that these kind of systems can provide and as you will see later on the script that I've written and how it does that allows us to then send an email with a discovery call link for them to be able to book in um but it's a great filter uh automatic way of filtering out the people who are able to be delivered in the current ways that we want to using own platform agentive um without my business part having to go through and dig through all these emails determine what kind of project it is so how exactly can you build this for your own business or for your clients while here on screen I've mapped it out because this is definitely one of the more complex templates and and systems that I've given away so I've wanted to map it out here so all in the same page before you go ahead so if at any point you get lost or views you can come back to this and understand exactly what we're trying to do at each step the way that we're going to set up the system is that on your website or for your client or however you want to set this up in this case we're going to be assuming that you have a button or something on the website you can click and that click and that button is going to take you to a form we're going to be creating a form on a platform called fill out forms it is kind of a free alternative that I found to to type form and type form can get quite expensive I wanted to find a free alternative for you and I've created a template for this form so you can just copy it over and then connect it up how I show you so when that form is submitted and we take an information like the name phone number the email Etc then let's go to use that phone number to do our first automation that's done on make.com that make.com automation that I've already created and you're going to be able to get the template to download and upload to make that's going to then use the air AI API air AI is the AI phone calling service and platform that we're going to be using air AI has an API that we can call from within make so this automation is going to trigger a call and we're going to of course create some kind of agent on AI and give it instructions in terms of what's it's going to say and then on that call it's going to attempt to qualify them as you saw on the call before it's going to say is your project a chatbot type build and of course you can modify this later on to whatever use case you need but in this case we'll be doing but using the script that I'm going to provide from the existing warning so I want to and it's going to attempt to qualify them and if it comes out as being qualified as in yes the project as a chatbot based project that we can deliver on agena then it's going to trigger the second automation that again template will be provided on make.com and that is going to send a cly link using just a regular Gmail account going to send an email to the person and the email that they provided here on this fall going to send them an email containing a cal link and the leader is going to be able to bug a call whenever suits them and here you can see if they're not qualified it's just going to end the call let them know that we'll follow up with them when we're accepting those kinds of clients so how it's all going to piece together now let's get stuck into creating it first things first we need to create the form that's going to trigger this entire automation it going to be attach to your website or wherever you want this is a template that I've already created for you on a free alternative to type form as mentioned this and everything else that is going to be part of this template and the sort of downloadable resources for this going to be available on my free school Community go down to the first link in the description there'll be a link to sign up to my school on the school there'll be a little tab once you've joined if might take a few minutes to let you in there is a tab that says YouTube resources then under the YouTube resources tab will be a reference to this video and on that post there will be all of the resources I've mentioned so to get started I go down there and join the school and you'll be able to find this link here which will take you to this page and then you can click on use template that's going to ask you to create a fill out account as I mentioned it is free I think you can get up to like 1,000 submissions for free or something so it's going to last for quite a while then you want to click use template and then you'll have this here so this as I mentioned this is going to be for a morning side AI example so I've made this seem kind of techy we've got a cover page name email phone budget description and then ending so all pretty straightforward looks pretty clean a lot cleaner than a Google form or something um and we can actually go to preview this you can see you can fill it out as you'd expect basically so once you've got this template ready to go then we can exit the preview and if you click on the Integrations tab up here you'll see one for make here now first you need to make an account on make make.com or there will be a link down below to sign up make is by far my favorite automations platform it is cheaper than zapia and I know there's something is pretty important for a lot of you guys is keeping the cost down when you're starting some of these AI businesses so make is definitely my go-to and I like the graph editor I think there's a lot more depth to it compared to Zio personally so once you've created an account on make then you can come back to fill out and you can click on make here and it's going to take you to this app invite page and what you need to do is click here to install fill out forms to your make account it's a custom application that you need to integrate into your make account by click on the team install finish the wizard and then we need to load in our first automation template that again is available on my school go down to the description join the school you can get it off there to load this in and import the template you can click on scenarios on the left create a new scenario and you can click on on the more down the bottom import the blueprint choose file initiate call so this is the automation that's going to be initiating the call based on the form submission here we have two nodes super basic easy to get your head around as a beginner we have the fill out forms and we have the HTTP request fill out form we need to sync up to the correct form I'm going to add a new web hook going to call it tutorial I'm going to select the form as contact us one the one that I just created up here click okay and now over here on HTTP I can scroll down these things should already be filled out for you but in they're not if we delete each of these I can take you through how we've set them up so this is how we are going to be initiating the call on air AI so up here you can see Airi has an API we're going to be making a call to them we're going to be authenticating our request and then we're going to be sending some information off with instructions basically on who to call and and how to call them so this prompt ID basically refers to the agent on AI that we're going to be using we'll be changing that in a second so don't worry too much about that on the phone what we need to do is insert the phone number here we need to insert the first name into the name column and then we can insert the email as well as extra metadata that we're going to pass through AI so with those set up we can click the X here we need to replace with an API key shortly we can save that there so now that we have the form created ready to take in the information from the user we have a trigger setup so when that form is filled out it's going to be triggering a new call we now need to create our agent and set up our air AI account so we can head over to air. a links will be down in the description as well you can create an account here I already have an account when you do create an account I believe they ask for your card details so you will need to put it on file but from if you just look quickly here at the reports you can see that the costs really low I think it might be 50 cents per call or something like that so if you're doing up 50 to 100 of these a month it's it's not really going to add up too bad so when you compare that to the amount of time and effort saved by creating these systems I think it's well worth it so that's a sort of price issue first thing we need to do on AI is to set up a twilio account so Airi uses twio and a phone number you can get and buy on twilio to do all the calling for you so they don't actually have that built in we need to go to the Integrations tab here if we go to the twilio settings then need to go to twilio do if you have an account then you can sign in if you don't already then create an account it is free sign into my account here once you're inside your Twitter your account you will need to add some kind of billing so that you're able to purchase a phone number once you put your card on file then come to this homepage here and we can click on phone numbers manage and then buy a number here you will see a whole bunch of phone numbers that you're able to purchase for your account if you're looking for a specific area code say your business is based in a certain city or state you can pick the area code that you want to use in this case I can search one up and purchase a number based off that personally I'm not two words I've just bought any number you can pick one here and go buy there may be some stuff that it gets you to fill out here in terms of regulations it sort of changes all the time if it's not letting you buy then there's probably some kind of form or information you need to fill out to to complete the registration of your account just do all that and then you can buy a phone number here once that's been purchased you should be able to go to active numbers and you will see it in here and once you see number in here all you need to do to get your details for AI which is a twio account Sid and twio or token is to come to the top left up here click on this link to view your dashboard and then if if you scroll down you'll see your account Sid we can copy this paste it in here and copy your all token and paste it in here also and click save now I've connected our twio account up and purchased a number so we're ready to start creating our own agent go back to create click on the create tab on AI and click new agent call this Ms follow up and go to go standard create from scratch as I said I've already written the script for this in terms of what I want it to do within this tutorial so if you're following along and want to make the exact same thing and maybe make some modifications the script itself will be available on the resource h on my free school community so you can go down and get that as well so what I'm going to do here is just delete everything I'm going to paste in the script to make sure that I have a lift line here to allow the prospect to respond then what I like to do is modify this a little bit to say hi Prospect name it's Emma from morning side AI just going through the script quickly you can see how I've structured this thing it's going to ask if they have some time 2 minutes to answer some questions about the AI project they're interested in building can you tell me a bit about your business industry and size Etc wait for the response will you give me an outline of the solution then we're going to ask them directly is this a chat bot of some kind cuz if so it is able to be delivered on a gen our own platform and because this saves us a ton of effort on the development side and we pass it on to the business that's the focus of what we're delivering as an agency right now and then here's really the magic of the whole script it's this conditional check if they say yes then say you'll send an email with a link to booking a call if no then say they'll be in touch when we're accepting clients outside of agenta based projects and this here if the agent says it is what's going to trigger the email that we send with the Cy link so you'll see that that'll make sense in a second but for now that's the script you can take read or modify it as you need I like to change the accent over here to the female Australian I think it sounds a lot more realistic than some of the ones on here and then we're going to click save here and then if you want to you can test it here you just need to create some kind of number if you're not based in the US you can do what I do and create a Skype account and then you can purchase a us-based number and then you're able to send and receive calls from within Skype so this is one of my Skype numbers that I have if I click call now it's going to call me and say hi David blah and start the conversation that way I don't want to test it this way I want to try and test it without our trigger from the forms submission final step we need to do in order to get that trigger and call system working is to come up to the top left here and this number in the middle chat. a. a/ agent SL this number you need to double click on this and copy it head back to make and back and make we can click on the HTTP request we can scroll down and replace this prompt ID with the agent ID that we just copied once we click okay on that now when we initiate the call with this HTTP request we are letting Airi know which agent we want to be using for that particular call now the final step is to get our own API key here very easily done we can click on the top right up here Integrations again client API I can create one code tutorial create a new one copy this head back to make then I'm going to double click on this paste it in make sure there's a space between beer Bas and then your API key and then everything's looking good to go we can click okay I'm going to hit run once on this it's going to be waiting and now we can give another spin on our contact for if I go to this is contact us one yep and go publish I'm going to shoot it out to another page start and go through this Liam now I can put in my Skype number that I wanted to call and this is a nice little of drop down we go next say it's a $5,000 project chatbot please now when we submit that if I get my handy dandy phone out here and give it a second hey Liam it's Emma from morning side AI hi there hey how's it going you just filled out our contact form so I wanted to follow up with you do you have a couple of minutes to answer some questions about your AI Pro okay thank you Emma yep so that's obviously working we filled out the form it triggered the call and now we just need the final and tricky step of creating some kind of action that's to be triggered off the back of this call if they pass the qualification criteria then we can send them the cly link and they can book it automatically so this is really the Magic's dip and yes you guessed it I've made another template that we can use for this so heading back over to make what I want to do is on this one is to switch the scheduling on so immediately as the data arrives that means every time there's a form submission this is going to be triggered I want to save this and back out again and I want to create a new scenario I'm going to import the second template that will be on my resource Hub import Boo and here we have another very basic a what we want to do here is click on web hooks I want to add a new one I'm going to call this tutorial AI calling create a new web hook then I'm going to copy this address and head back over to air AI then if I go back to my top right corner Integrations and this zapia whook URL zappia is the recommended automation platform that AI likes to work with but because it's not very easy for me to make templates for you and pass them over I choose to use make in this case we can actually just put our make whip or ql in here figured out how we can get this to work using make as well save us some money easier to pass around templates and using a platform that I personally prefer a little more than zapier so if you save that so what this is essentially doing is that when we go back to our agent here we can come up and click add an action we can click custom and we can call the action email calendly link and then we can tell the system what kind of phrase should be triggering this so it's kind of picking it up throughout the conversation here you can see every already you've done this before I'll email you a link to book and a call is the phrase that we want to trigger this custom action that we're creating I've used these exact words as what the AI should say we successfully qualified them and we're ready to get them to book into a court so this phrase is key and this is also important as well I'm going to copy this and then we're going to save this action and that's the only one that's enabled on this account and then we can actually set up some stats tracking here which is Handy for the back inside of things as well and we can go to custom here email calendly link so this is the outcome of the call and it's basically a label that will allow us to see what the outcome of the call is at a glance through a big list of calls and we don't have to dig into these calls it'll tell us basically okay this one they hung up on us we need to follow up or in this case with email account be link so what needs to happen client must have a chat bot style now the way that they're actually detecting this as you can see here is automatic tracking so they're just using a an AI system a large language model to analyze the transcript and determine if this has been met so the information you put here is really important to make sure that this tracking is as accurate as it can be uh based on text like this so we save that as well so the primary is emailed caly link and then the other ones is do not call list and followup now comes the trickiest part of all is we need to line these all up in a row and kind of sequence them correctly so so that this WEP fires we get the right data in it we can then pass on to this Gmail step in order for this to work we need to be hovering over this redetermined data structure button on the correct WEP and then we need to refill out the form initiate a call answer the call go through the call and then AI is going to trigger that zappier WEP that we put into our settings and then makeer is going to learn the data structure to expect and the key field that we need to get is the email from the original form submission so if you're ready to do this this is a bit of a juggling act okay so step one for this is just to refresh our form I'm going to click Start fill F this out okay so now I've filled out the form I'm about to receive a call on Skype okay here it comes then I need to go to the call and be qualified and then I need to rederm the data structure mway through so it's a little bit of a juggling act hey William it's Emma from Morningside AI you just filled out our contact form so I'm following up with you do you have a couple of minutes to answer some questions to see if we can help you with your AI project yes I'm an AI assistant if you couldn't tell awesome thanks for taking the time William will you tell me a bit about your business what industry are you in and how big is your company I'm in the fitness industry and I have five employees that's great William so you're in the fitness industry and you have a company with five employees right now could you give me an outline of the AI solution you're interested in getting built for your business I want to build a chatbot for my warehouse manager got it William so you're looking to build a chatbot specifically for your warehouse manager that sounds like a great idea right now we're only accepting projects that can be built and delivered on our own platform called agencies this helps us reduce development hours and pass on the savings to you is this project a chat bot for your warehouse manager yep sure is that's fantastic William a chat bot for your warehouse manager can definitely streamline operations and improve efficiency I'll email you a link to book a call with Josh our coo here at mornings side he'll have more questions about your project okay great thanks by okay so as you saw it says successfully determined as was waiting waiting waiting and it was actually a little bit before she even said it but on their side they're obviously firing that WEP so when it says it's determine the data structure we can click over here to Gmail and we can see if I delete these ones on the left here you can see that now we have all this information from the whip hook and in order for it to have these fields that we can then insert into the Gmail we need to have done that step first and the most important one is this one down here extra Fields email now if you go back to our other automation you remember that we were passing in the email as metadata as extra data you can see here metadata email we having to send this as metadata when we make the call and then we needing to pluck that back out on the end on the other side so that we can send the email to the right person so this is definitely the trickiest part of the whole thing but as you can see we've successfully got the email here we can enter that in and then we have their first name so I've already filled this out I Pi first name thanks for chatting with our AI assistant emo but here's the C link and okay and the final thing that I need to point out here is that this web hook you'll notice back in AI we've only set up one web hook so you're thinking what if I have multiple different tools or actions that I want to set up the way they have the set up is that it only going to call one and then on the make side or the zapia side you need to handle the different actions yourself so here we have a filter and within this filter we are checking the action property that has been sent by AI right now it might look a little bit silly cuz we only have one option but if we had two of these and we had say action one which will send a cly link and then another action was send a PDF or send a free resource you would then need to have multiple of these through a router and then you'd have a another filter as well so you remember I told you to copy the name of this email caly link and that's what we're going to be putting into uh this filter here so whatever it comes to AI there could be all sorts of different actions but we want to be filtering out email caly link and that's why we've said if the action name equals email caly link then we're going to be emailing the caly link to the correct person so over time if you end up getting lots of different actions you of course can add multiple through here and use a router as well so a little bit more complex don't want to get into that now but we are good to go and test this final step of making sure that we are getting these emails sent to us with the calendar link after the call we can save make sure that the scheduling is on here so that it will run whenever it's triggered and we can go back head back to my little YouTube folder here we can see that both of these are on I'm not sure if you need to have Pro Plan or not I think you might be able to get away with having two that are on and a waiting responses all the time otherwise you may need to upgrade to like a $10 plan um but aside from that we have both of these on we're now ready to test it through and through give another submission on the contact form and this time will use a real email so that I can check if I'm going to receive the email from this second automation here so I can go start that's fantastic Liam since your project is a chatbot it can definitely be built on our platform agentes this will help streamline the development process and pave you time and call I'll send you an email with a link to book a call with Y thank you bu so that's triggered successfully as you can see the action here is email Cy link and that is being filtered through here so if we had triggered a different action in a different flow on AI and we wanted to to filter it to a different place we would set up another filter here and a router filter for a different one because we only got one the filter that we're looking for is email Cy link and yes it's come through email caly link is the exact same as the action that we're looking for in here which is shown by tick and successfully send our email as well so if I go two content now if I go on to my phone here and I go to Gmail and I look on here refresh yes yes okay we've we've successfully gotten the email through formatting isn't great I'll put it up on the side here something I can work on here within make I'm not sure what formatting options they have we successfully got the email through they've sent it through to us we can change the from here and I can put in from Morningside AI or from Leo or something but we' finally got this thing working I hope you guys have been able to follow along and get something similar to the setup where they can fill out a form on your website or your client's website and it's going to trigger it I think the bones of what we've built here going back to our little handy Danny figma here the bones of what we built here in terms of how you can trigger the calls via an API is really what you guys will be able to take away and modify in different ways this has taken me and my my team a couple days to figure out an easy way for you to do this so please I've tried to film this three times a day because every time I wasn't happy with how succinct and direct I was and in communicating this to you all so please please if you've enjoyed the video head down and leave a like subscribe to this channel if you want to keep in the loop on

              "text": "AI video generation is here and with it comes huge new opportunities to make money in the AI space in this video I'll be highlighting six unique ways you can make money with open AI Sora so that you can leverage this new and exciting technology before the rest of the world catches on however while it's clear that Sora and other AI video generation platforms will change the world we live in drastically it isn't entirely clear how people like you and I can use this insanely powerful new technology to make money online outside of the obvious uses like stock footage I haven't really seen anyone think outside the box and identify clear and tangible ways to create value with Sora so in this video I'll be sharing six unique ways to make money with Sora that I've identified that will get you thinking about this new opportunity in the right way if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development company morning side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the ideas I'm about to share with you today the ideas that I'm sharing today are what I would be looking at getting into if I didn't already have my hands full with my existing businesses so these ones are all yours let's get started so what is Sora Sora s o r a is a revolutionary AI model by open AI that can create super realistic videos up to a minute long from just text input Sora is able to render videos in different aspect ratios and either create from a text prompt where you describe what you want to see or from a starting image that gets brought to life it's worth noting that Sora isn't a ailable to the public yet and it's likely going to remain closed until F the notice for me this feels like a huge moment for the AI industry this year and it's why we're looking at opportunities to make money with it today if you've ever played around with other AI video generation models you know that what we have with Sora is a massive lead forward compared to what we had which is why it's so important to talk about today and the fact that it's come from open AI a company that is really leading the charge with a lot of the AI stuff that the whole world is using it is so important for us to take a closer look at what opportunities we have to make money with this now and in the future method number one is selling prompts to businesses from what we've seen with mid Journey doy Runway and other text to image or text to video tools getting the final output right can be very difficult and just like with promy chat gvt you can start to sell these prompts to businesses if you remember back through this time last year some of the first ways people were making money with AI was selling chat GPT prompts and putting them on these prompt selling websites and things like that the same thing happened with the image iteration models and sure enough the same thing will happen with these video generation models getting a video to look great using Sora can take many forms of iterating and refining your props and if you're able to say nich this down to a specific use case like I will make product demonstration videos or I will make cinematic drone shots and if you're able to specialize in different areas and say this is a set of props that will allow you to make this kind of content very well then there'll be some kind of audience or customers who'll be interested in paying you for that that prompt that allows you to generate that specific type of content secondly we have lifestyle content generation and instead of having to travel all over the world soon you'll be able to inject yourself as a character into the scene and generate all these insane lifestyle clips that people need for their personal branding and things like this I've learn some guys who literally taken months off work and spend tens of thousands of dollars to go to Exotic locations and live this lavish lifestyle and capture it all on video so that they can then reuse that in their personal branding and their short form content and things like that to drive money to the business and to make themselves look good online and so if you think about the ROI for you to be able to generate this for them the time they don't have to spend months away from their business or at least a couple couple weeks they don't have to spend all this money on travel they don't have to spend money on videographers either so by creating this kind of content you are saving the time the money and the effort of having to go out there and get all these clips themselves so therefore when you compare this to I know stock footage the ROI of this livestyle content with the person in there compared to generating some stock footage with s is very clear that that they're two very different things and two very different values assigned to each I think if you are looking to make money with Sora this is very very important to keep in mind which is how can I pick a type of content that I can create that has a lot more value attached to it thirdly we have creating a course for editors or content creators creating courses and teaching people how to get the most out of Sora to integrate it into their videos is a fantastic opportunity as well I figured this one out for my editor Shan who as soon as Sora came out he text me say man this thing is going to be the game changer for our b-roll and making his his creative process of filling in these videos and making them look pretty far easier because instead of having to go and dig through all these stock footage and and trying to find the ones that match the right scene you can just go over and type the scene that he's looking for get it generated and throw it into the video so while selling that kind of thing to businesses and generating the stock page and selling it to people may not be a great opportunity as I mentioned before cuz it's not a it's not super high value content in particular but there is definitely going to be an opportunity for creating some kind of educational product that teaches editors and creators how to adopt this into their workflow and how to get the the most out of it really instead of them having to figure it all out for themselves you can create an educ product that says hey look if you're looking to create these kind of stock footage or you're looking to create these here are some great startup prompts you can do it essentially you'd be teaching them the basics on how to use it and then you might throw on some prompts youve read in that have been particularly well for certain types of content before we get into number four if you are enjoying the video please it down below and leave a like while you're down there if you like AI business content and how to make money with AI and make the most of this opportunity that's all we talk about here in this channel so if you want to stay in the loop for more of that you can subscribe down below and leave a comment if you have any other ideas that we haven't touched on in this video at the end number four is House toy Generation videos now this one might be a little far out but I thought I'd put it in here just to show you what kind of use cases may appear in the near future as these things become publicly available and they put some kind of improvements that allow you to control the video generation a little bit more in order to sell a house you of course need some photos of it and if you really want to sell a house having a really nice video of that house that makes it look great the lighting is good this kind of thing can be quite expensive for a realtor to get in and also quite a time consuming process as well so if you can somehow streamline that process of using Sora and maybe taking in a couple photos you get the reality to go through and take snap snap snap snap all of the photos of the interior and even potentially the exterior and get a a SORA created drone shot these kind of things are are massive value ads for the business and if you can help them to sell a house faster there's a very clear Roi for them there so I'm not sure how long it's going to take for us to get there but these kind of use cases where you pick a specific area and say look we're going to generate great video content for relatives to sell their houses that in my opinion would be a great way to leverage Sora and its video generation capabilities number five is to create a course for marketing agency owners going back to the education opportunity again if you were to create a course for marketing agency owners or their team members on how they can generate massive amounts of variations of ads by teaching them quickly how to create high quality ad creative variations you are providing a direct Roi to the business in the form of the more creatives that they're able to test on something like Facebook ads or or meta ads typically the more money they'll be able to make on the platform and of course instead of doing the education side of things and and educating agency owners on how to do this internally you could create a a Content agency and sell the service out to marketing agencies or people who are using creatives and and video for marketing and finally AI personas on roids an AI Persona is when you can take a bunch of information on a certain person say for example you took 10 of my top YouTube videos and took the transcripts you put them into a knowledge base and made that available to and a chatbot or an agent uh then you give it some prompting that also tell it you are Liam mle you will be given stuff from my YouTube channel transcript chunks Etc use that information to reply to user queries in the Tot so essentially creating an AI clone of some that is what an AI Persona is I've talked about it before on my channel these AI personas are actually pretty easy to create if you use something like my platform ative so if you want to try that out there'll be a link in the description but AI personas are typically text based you'll text back and forth and say hey hey Liam how do I do this and it will reply using the knowledge base to the query some people put voices on them where you can send uh you can send a message and it will send a voice note back and now will Sora once we able to get access to it not only will you be able to generate the the words that this person should say so what my AI clone of myself should say to your question you can say it in my voice using something like a 11 Labs voice generator you can also now generate me talking and and saying something using things like Sor imagine getting a little clip from homi or something and he's giving you a breakdown on how to attack a sales team issue and it's not just his voice it's not just talking from all of his book content it's also a video of him like you're getting a cameo from him if you've heard of Cameo you can go on and ask a celebrity you pay them $100 and they'll give you a video back like hyping you up or giving you some advice or something so this kind of system would essentially be Cameo but available at all times and you could create it for coaches or Internet personalities or whoever you want and sell those systems to them as some pros cons and my thoughts pros of course they are huge creative opportunities and this take unlocks for filmmakers Content creators and digital artists I'm personally going to be using it a lot in my videos to help Boll and and appropriate scenes I don't think we fully understand just how much this is going to change our world there is huge implications for this throughout the economy I'm honestly still on the fence a little bit about this I don't know how I feel about our movies or TV shows becoming AI generated or anything like that or or watching YouTubers imagine I you become an AI and you're just watching a video generated of me and I haven't had to sit here and film this thing so I'm not too sure how I feel about it and I'm sure there's going to be plenty of ways to make money with it but I would expect open AI to be very careful in the roll out of this things like if you're able to generate a video of someone else without proper consent for that and make them say things like making deep fakes on it I think they're going to have to have very strict things about do you have consent prove that you have consent to be able to generate a video of this person so I'm not sure how that's all going to work there's going to be some very tight guard rails I'd assume and based on what open a eyes done previously with jet GPT as they seem to do a pretty good job so on the safety side I'm not too not too worried about uh opening eyes while out of this I think they will be very careful with it in this current version open AI has said that it does struggle with things like physics and real movement and lacking motion consistency and things like this also it's got the typical issues of hands and fingers and the human body having issues with uh with getting those details right so there's still things to be done I think for many use cases that doesn't really matter too much I mean if it's a drone shot of the beach there's no fingers to mess up in that so I think it's just going to come down to certain use cases like if you're trying to copy me and replace me as a content creator you're going to have a hard time because if I'm doing this with the time it's pretty hard to replace that but I'm just happy that we have another one of these incredible tools right at our fingertips not only do we have the entire world's information at our fingertips bybt we now have the whole film studio and videography team and drone pilot everything you can imagine is now add our fingertips here on a computer so if this isn't a great time to be alive I don't know what it is and I hope you guys all found these ideas stimulating give you some ideas maybe think outside the box want to throw a couple curve balls in there that makes you think about there's not just a direct one of how can I sell this video but maybe I can educate people on this this whole Market so people who going a need to adopt the stuff why don't I try to learn it and teach them how to do it like think think outside the BL size there's so much opportunity here but that's all for the video I hope you guys have enjoyed make sure to subscribe down below if you're looking for more AI business content like this how to make money with AI That's all we talk about here on the channel and of course if you've enjoyed the video please hit down and leave a like that would really support me making these videos leave a comment down below if you have any other interesting ways that you can make money with Sora and let me know if there's any other videos you'd like to see to make in the future if you're interested in starting an AI business in 2024 you can watch my complete di that's over an hour and a half here that I released recently but aside from that guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

experience required Etc on each of these so that you can select the right vehicle for you to succeed then in chapter 3 we'll be doing a crash course on the core AI business skills in the Practical section of this video where you'll be learning the core skills that you need to succeed as an AI entrepreneur and finally in chapter 4 I'll be giving you a step-by-step launch guide to start an AI business in 2024 as a beginner that avoids all the common mistakes that I see beginners make that prevent them from becoming successful in the AI space as an entrepreneur I can confidently say you will not find another video like this anywhere on the internet as there's no one else with my AI business experience on YouTube as I said I've SED four different types of AI businesses in 2023 three of which I'm still actively running right now and I also around the world's largest community of AI agency owners so I've got to see firsthand the skills and the strategies that hundreds and thousands of my students have used to build successful AI businesses and what I've done in this video is really condensed all of this knowledge into a complete guide to starting an AI business in 2024 to get you started on the best business model for you with my step-by-step strategy if you've clicked on this video you already know how much potential the AI space has for those who are willing to go and get it my story of going from zero to over $100,000 per month in Under 12 months is evidence of just how rapidly your life can change with the right sequence of moves so if you are serious about making the most of this potentially once in a lifetime opportunity what I want you to do is firstly close all of your other tabs go and get a notebook and a pen and dedicate some time and set it aside to watch this video re-watch it add this to your watch later so that if you fall off the video at any point you can come back and find it easily because this is going to take a couple watches to really absorb all the information that I'm giving so that you can take it and apply it in your own life pause the video until you've done all that and then we can move forward before you sit here for a half an hour or an hour and listen to some random dude yap on about making money online you should probably know that the person you're listening to knows this\nas someone who was once in your position browsing YouTube and trying to find a way to make money online I've taken the bait of enough dudes with Lambos to know that it is incredibly important to know the background and also the intentions of someone like myself before taking their advice so if you're new to the channel and want to know a little bit more about myself and my story here's a little explainer but if you don't care or already know my story feel free to skip to the good stuff using the time status below so my name is Liam otley I'm a 23-year-old entrepreneur originally from a small city in New Zealand called farang and around 2 years ago I moved to live here in Dubai I've been trying to run successful online businesses since I left High School in 2018 and my AI business Journey started at the end of 2022 when my mind was blown by chat gbt and what it could do upon realizing that the AI space was about to explode I did something I never thought I would do start a YouTube channel by consistently posting AI business content over 2023 I was able to launch four AI businesses of my own firstly Morningside AI is my AI development company where we build AI solutions for other businesses secondly my AAA accelerator is my AI business Community where myself and my coaches teach other people how to start an AI business like morning side thirdly agentive is my AI SAS platform that simplifies the creation of AI agents for businesses and I also did some Consulting on the side which is kind of like my fourth little business I started last year it has been through starting scaling and struggling with these businesses that I've learned what I'm about to share with you in this video there's a lot of things that I wish I knew that I now feel obliged to share so that you can avoid some of the mistakes that I made and throughout the next four chapters of this video I'll be sharing this knowledge my focus over the next few years is to grow agentive into the musthave platform for AI agency owners to deliver their Solutions fast and effectively and I really make it worth hundreds of millions of dollars one of the cool things about my journey at least the AI part of it is that you can literally scroll back through my videos and see me transform from this AI Noob into the leader of a new wave of online business that I'm extremely proud to have started so that's my background the second part of this is my intentions why am I giving away the source and creating more competitiv for myself firstly the space is way too big for me to tackle on my own my company morning side Ai and agent and things like this there's no way that we could take even just one Niche on our own that it's such a big Market that's developing here there's no reason for me to be greedy and kind of gay cup it secondly and kind of selfishly I'd like some more cool friends and when I make these videos and introduce people to the AI business space you eventually start your own businesses and then we become friends at some point I've met some great people and make great friends out of my community and out of the people in my paid program and this is really just a way for me to continue use business as a vehicle to make new friends and and build relationships which is really the the best part of my life and thirdly Goodwill compounds faster than money so about me making these videos making these free resources hopefully you appreciate it you share my videos around and that compounds my growth and and my personal brand and everything that I've Tred to do all my life faster than any kind of money ever would so with all that out of the way I hope you think I'm qualified to be teaching what I'm about to teach I'm so excited for you and I hope someday in the future we cross paths and you can say that this is the video that started you on your journey to becoming an AI entrepreneur and I truly hope that some of you watching this video go on to be far more successful than me in the AI space cuz that will mean I did a good job with this video Chapter one is starting an AI business right for you before we can get into the nitty-gritty like your step-by-step launch strategy and teaching you the core skills you need to succeed as an AI entrepreneur which we're going to be covering later in this video the first question you need to ask is whether or not starting an AI business is right for you that is the focus of this chapter by the end you'll fully understand a few key things like whether or not entrepreneurship is right for you whether or not you need to be a developer to succeed in AI business how much time per week you need to commit to succeed with AI business and why would you choose to start an online AI business and not a different model like smma or Drop Shipping AI is a broad field and there truly is something for everyone in this space but answering these questions is key before moving forward so firstly is entrepreneur ship right for you before you waste even another second watching this video we need to address the question is entrepreneurship right for you is starting your own business the right move and do you have what it takes and the commitment required to make this successful in the long run entrepreneurship and particularly online entrepreneurship has become very romanticized and hip these days but there's actually a significant Dark Side to it that you don't see a lot of the time on Instagram and you don't see all of the failures really behind the scenes so I thought I'd take you through a little trip right now of my experience of becoming an online entrepreneur and how I've gone from basically having no skills and no money to where I am right now living in my dream apartment in Dubai going on business trips to the Austrian Alps and generally living the life I've always dreamed of with my friends as I've said in my other videos building on my business takes time effort and sacrifice and there is no way around it I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's going to be easy it's going to be a walk in the park because it is not and it's probably going to take a lot longer than you think right now to find success but as you learn later in this video it is well worth the effort the life of an entrepreneur is dotted with brutal ups and downs and the highest of highs and the lowest of lows the most difficult thing for a lot of people to adapt to about entrepreneurship is that at the end of the day you and only you are entirely responsible for all of your successes and all of your failures so there's total accountability on both sides and because of this not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship and not everyone has what it takes everything I'm telling you is from my own experience of being an online entrepreneur for 5 years now since I graduated high school over my years in the online business space I've had my first year of ups and downs I started my entrepreneurial Journey on my Gap here while I was living in Edinburgh I had this crusty little flat and I was working for the hours in the morning before I went to work I'd go to work and I'll would come back and then I'll go to the gym and then I'd work all the time up until I went to bit over this period I lost all of my money trying to start e-commerce stores and only after 14 months that I make my first dollar of profit so the life of an entrepreneur starting out can be rough and a lot of the time the success that you envision happening is going to take a lot longer than you initially thought but success is possible and it is rewarded to the people who are willing to do the work on a long enough time scale so as someone who doesn't come from money and literally used to sell fake Rolexes and protein powder at high school just to make a bit of money to someone who now owns one believe me that entrepreneurship is worthwhile if you're willing to do the work and when you do get there I promise you it is the best job in the world I get to work on projects that I'm excited to work on every single day I get to work wherever I want in the world I get to make money with people I really enjoy being around and really just live a life on my own terms and at a certain stage you get to set your sights on building something that you are truly proud of like I am right now so what I'm trying to say here is that you need to be self-aware enough to be able to ask yourself the question of do I have what it takes am I ready to commit myself to this journey that is probably going to take a lot longer than I think but is the reward at the end of it worth my time and commitment now if the answer for you is yes and you are ready to commit to this journey just know that the hardest part is getting started the purpose of this video is to educate you on AI business and then give you the information you need in a step-by-step process to get started down the right path the first time now if you still don't have a notebook and a pen go and get by now you save this video to your watch later because if you've committed to this you're going to need to watch this multiple times you're going to sit here for an hour half an hour however long it's going to be so that you can really study each part of this video so that you can get off on the right foot do I need to be a developer to start an AI business this is probably the most common question I get from people who are on the fence about starting an AI business and a pretty valid question at that since I first started talking about the AI businesses that I run this has been a hotly debated topic with seemingly everyone weighing in on things in this topic and and taking pot shots bya YouTube videos and tweets and stuff the simple answer to this question is no you do not need to be a developer to start an AI business the long-winded answer is a little bit different as you'll learn later in this video there are a number of different businesses you can start in the AI space there really is something for everyone some of these businesses we're going to cover can only be started if you are a developer some of them can be made a lot easier if you have a little bit of development experience and some you can start with absolutely no development experience at all so no you don't need to be a developer to start an AI business 2024 there are plenty of onramps into the space that are available to everyone and later in this video I'll help you pick the best option out of the five business models for you next question is how much time do I need to invest each week to create an AI business to prepare for this video I spoke to as many people as I could who are outside the space working regular jobs and unable to drop everything to pursue an online AI business and aside from do I need to be a developer questions about the the time investment needed was the second most common question I got sometimes it's difficult for me to think back to when I was 18 and working a day job and trying to cram and work on my e-commerce stores by getting up at 5:00 a.m. and working until I went to work and then coming back from work and then working until 11:00 p.m. each night but for many of you who want to start an online business to be able to work on your own schedule whenever you want this time aspect and the time investment needed to see success is a huge factor in your decision-making process of whether you jump into this opportunity in the first place now I'm not going to Sugar cat it some of the AI business types that I'm going to cover later in this video do require a lot of work especially for a complete beginner but others have a much more gradual buildup and are much more suitable for people who are busy students or moms and dads or for those of you who are already working in 9 to5 and you want to kind of at least chart a course into AI Space by taking small steps each day for those of you who are on a restricted time budget sequencing your steps into the AI business world is extremely important as by chaining together the right types of businesses and slowly evolving towards your end goal you can achieve the flexibility you need to get in and stay in the game the step bystep strategy to start your own AI business in 2024 that we'll be covering in the Final Chapter will set you up on a part that will allow you to make these gradual improvements and commit as much time as you need and can afford to uh invest in your business so to answer the question starting an AI business as a beginner can require you to put in anywhere from 1 hour to 12 hours per day it simply depends on the business model you choose from the ones about to cover and how rapidly you want to see results obviously more time put in will lead to faster results so it's it's a kind of balancing of those things the vehicle that you pick and also the the time scale that you want to see the results on another valid question that I get a lot is on why someone to choose to start an online business in the AI space and not some of the more typical online business models like social media marketing agencies or e-commerce stores or Amazon FBA and the easiest way to explain this is from my own experience as someone who has run successful e-commerce stores and has helped to scale a social media marketing agency my decision to go all in on the AI space wasn't an easy one when I was looking at the big picture regardless of the business model you choose creating your own successful online business will allow you to make $ 20 to $50,000 per month most business models will allow you to make up to that range and with this kind of income you have the means to live and work anywhere in the world on your own schedule from the laptop whatever you want and I've spent the past 3 years of my life traveling constantly with my businesses and kind of doing just that I've been fortunate enough to do awesome things over the past 3 years and I'm only 23 years old but with all else being equal with these business models yes you can make 20 to $50,000 a month if you put in the work you can live overseas you can run it fully on from your laptop wherever you want to with all of that stuff being equal the only difference between these business models is really the long-term benefits and long-term opportunities that they set you up for personally my goals are to make hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming decades and from my experience in the digital marketing and e-commerce base the opportunities to do so are far more limited than in the AI space what it really comes down to is which industry you want to bet on and build your skills personally I see more upside in the AI space right now because large language models as we know them are really only about a year old they did exist before that but in the current state and how people use them and and build them in businesses and use chat gbt it's only really been about 12 months that they've existed as they currently do this means that anyone can really be in the top 1% of experts very quickly and start to monetize their skill set I've literally done this in front of everyone over the past 12 months you can scroll back and see my earlier videos and you will see just how stupid I was when it came to a lot of the the stuff that I talk about now and when're comparing this ability that you've seen me do in front of your eyes to become an expert in the AI Space versus other Industries where you're going up against people who have maybe 10 plus years of experience 15 years if you go into the marketing space this guys have' been doing that for decades and for you to try to become an expert and start to compete on their level and try to get the kind of money and wealth that they are generating you've got like 15 years of of a of skill gap between you two but when you look at maybe myself and where you are right now 12 months is all that's elapsed and it's really a a much more closable Gap so if you choose to put your time and effort into this I space you have a much better chance a much shorter path to becoming one of these sort of top 1% of people within the space who are knowledgeable and considered experts and with becoming an expert you get expert level money and wealth starts to flow to you instead of you having to really struggle and force all these opportunities and find the opportunities for yourself at least in my experience they start to come to you and it's honestly being a complete game changer for my life and for my career so log story short if you are hungry to succeed and willing to commit to the AI space for the next 5 to 10 years I believe there's far more to be gained by starting a business in this emerging space and choosing to build your skill set in the AI space in particular and build a reputation in the space that can open up doors and opportunities that you never could have planned for a massive undeniable factor in entrepreneurial success is luck even guys like Jeff Bezos will tell you that in order to benefit from luck in many cases you need to be in the right place at the right time with the right skills with the right connections with the right resources but the good thing is is that you can engineer yourself to be able to take advantage of these Lucky Chances by constantly grinding in the space and building up those kind of things your resources your connections your skills you simply cannot get lucky if you don't have the the soil for the luck to land in if we use a kind of a seed analogy it needs to be able to land somewhere for you to cultivate that into a really big opportunity and great outcome for yourself for me right now the AI space is by far the most fertile soil that I could try to cultivate and it's well worth the time and effort of me continuously toiling and working in the space cuz I know that the opportunities are far far bigger than if I was going into a more mature sector where the chances of outsize returns I've kind of normalized by now I'm honestly just so excited to continue grinding and putting in the work in the space and excited to see what kind of plays come my way in the coming years by doing that you too can put your bets on the AI space and try to get in the way of some of the huge gains that are going to come but you need to convert from a spectator to an active participant in the market and I've talked about this some other videos but I think there is just a massive like 95% of people who are AI curious or into the an AI Enthusiast in the space right now don't take offense to this but all you are is a spectator you are just sitting there and watching and browsing and consuming videos like this but you're not ever making the jump over into being an actual participant of the market and that is only really possible through starting a business through starting a project through starting to do something rather than just consuming so take the knowledge that I'm giving you in this video and try to actually take your first step into making that jump into a participant cuz a participant is how you can build up those connections those skills skills Beyond just what the spectators and put yourself into the top five 1 0.1% of people in the space and you can start to generate some of the wealth that comes for being in that Minority now with all of those key questions out the way I want you to pause this video go over any notes you took and just really confirm and lock in with yourself that this is the kind of vehicle and this is the opportunity that you want to go in do you have the resources do you have the time are you willing to put in the effort is entrepreneurship even right for you one of the most common beginner mistakes I see when getting into businesses like this is that they just jump in and they don't actually do the maths and really build a solid foundation of conviction in the decision that they're making so I want you to really think right now is this right for me is this the right choice for me and I'm I willing to commit to it over the time that it's going to take to succeed because otherwise if you're not fully committed you're going to fall off halfway through and you're going to waste all this time so please have some kind of conviction be sure that this is right for you look over the questions I've just answered and if you're ready to move forward and you're ready to commit to this let's jump into the five different AI business types that you can start in 2024 chapter 2 two the five different types of online AI businesses the AI business landscape in 2024 truly has something for everyone and in this section we'll be breaking down what opportunities there are for beginners to get started the pros and cons of each and how you can progress through these different business models over time to LeapFrog towards bigger and better opportunities I've used this exact method of leapfrogging through different types of AI businesses as I've personally run all of the businesses will be covering here except the last one so I'm really sharing my experiences and what I wish I knew before starting so that you can avoid my mistakes AI business number one is AI Consulting The Experience required to start this is none the startup cost are zero the time to make money will make profit is around 3 months and the long-term potential of AI Consulting in my opinion is low starting off with the easiest of the bunch AI Consulting is a super beginner friendly way to start making money with AI in 2024 and by far one of the fastest ways to start earning if you follow the right steps there are two parts to starting your own Consulting business firstly learning the info you need to be able to help your clients and that includes the core skills that we'll be covering in the next section of this video so stick around for that secondly you need to attract the clients that you're going to do Consulting for so let's break this down Consulting is essentially profiting off of the knowledge gap between you and your target audience so rather than try to learn all this AI stuff themselves people will pay you or businesses will pay you to tell them things like what AI can do for their business the best AI tool to use for their industry or their use case where AI is going and how they can plan ahead not rocket science right you can actually learn this information over a month or two of study to be able to get to a point where you can start to take calls setting aside an hour or two per day to get deep into the AI Space by binging channels like mine and if you can afford it jumping into a paid Community like my accelerator to be tapped directly into the latest in the space and that'll allow you to build the knowledge Gap you need to become valuable as a consultant again a crash course to understand the foundational core skills you'll need to succeed as an AI consultant are going to be covered in the next section of this video you only really need enough info to be able to hop on your first few calls and you'll learn very quickly what you don't know and where you need to study based on the questions your clients are asking I say all this because I was literally doing it this time last year Consulting was actually the first way that I made money with AI last year by adding a cly link under my YouTube videos starting off at $300 for 45 minutes and to illustrate just how quickly can get started with AI Consulting I first tried chap GPT in December of 2022 I launched my channel in January of 2023 and by March I was booking three to five of these $300 Consulting calls per week an extra ,000 a week for just hopping on calls was pretty exciting for me at this point in my journey pretty soon I was getting bombarded with calls and I had to increase my prices to $500 for 45 minutes and then to 9.97 for 45 minutes in order to get the quantity of calls per week down to they'll have that I was happy with so that they were distracting me from the bigger things that I'm working on like morning side or my education business yes I've been charging over $1,000 per hour for my Consulting for the past 6 to 8 months and I know it's ridiculous and I even say that on my Cy beige but people still pay it the tricky part of course for most people is not necessarily the learning of the information which I'm going to make easy for you in a couple minutes but actually attracting the clients who are willing to pay for your time is typically where people get stuck my recommended strategy for getting started as a consultant is to pick one platform for for example X or Twitter or LinkedIn or YouTube Etc and focus on sharing your learnings there as you build your knowledge Gap this is exactly what I did on YouTube and it took me to over $1,000 per hour in the space of about 6 months you need to be able to follow your curiosity and try new tools and discover interesting use cases and share them constantly to prove that you know your with this consistent posting and frequently mentioning that you are available for Consulting calls you will be landing calls in no time this is what I did you look at all of my early YouTube videos the only way I was monetizing the channel was through these Consulting calls and throughout it I'd say hey look if you're interested in learning more about this you can book a call me down below for the first four or 5 months of my channel until the agency was up and running properly and making do some money I was saying Consulting call that was the call to action the conversion event I was pushing people towards the entire time if you do choose to go down the AI Consulting route it can help to Niche down to be an expert in one area this will allow you to charge more and build a reputation within your little space cuz again AI is very broad the if you're addressing business there's a million different types of businesses some examples of niching down your Consulting offer could be saying things like I help Home Services business owners to create their 24-month AI strategy or I help CEOs understand what AI means for their businesses and how to utilize it to crush to competition well I help real estate agents to wrap their heads around AI these are just a few ideas to get you going but this is the kind of niching down of like a specific area that you focus on that you can do and as a disclaimer your first 10 calls will be scary I was was terrified jumping on those calls but I pushed through and I offered a 100% money back guarantee so there was absolutely no risk of bad blood if I wasn't able to help them with my initially pretty spotty knowledge if you'd like an even more in-depth breakdown of how to start a Consulting business in the AI space let me know down below I'm more than happy to do one for you guys if there's enough demand business type number two is an AI education business experience required to start none startup cost 100 to 300 for courses and software time to profit around 3 months long-term potential in my opinion is medium there is a massive need for education and Educators in the AI space and I mean my my growth on YouTube has been a testament to that going from 0 to 100,000 Subs in 8 months last year by helping just entrepreneurs to get into Ai and learn more about it not only are there millions of views up for grabs but there's also millions of dollars up for grabs as people are willing to pay for specialized AI training and education my own AI education business AAA accelerator has has had over 2,000 people join over the past 6 months each paying anywhere from $97 to $197 per month to learn how to start an AI business from myself my coaches and my team if you don't believe me that AI education is a massive opportunity for people to get started with AI business you need to remember that for us as people who are somewhat in the space or at least AI curious which I'm sure many of you or all of you watching this video are we can take basic skills like using chat gbt properly for granted but there are billions of people who are yet to discover or at least properly utilize the magic of large language models and things like chbt when you combine this with the fact that millions of people each year in Western and sort of First World countries are going to lose their jobs due to automation from AI systems there is exploding demand for high quality educational resources like courses for people who are out of a job and are looking to become profession in AI so that they can find a new job or at least prevent themselves from losing their jobs to AI again remember that AI will not replace humans hum humans who can use AI will replace humans who can't therefore there is undoubtedly a huge need for AI education businesses to come in and facilitate this education and upskilling of the entire working population of the world and even kids too like everyone's going to need to learn how to use this stuff at on point so starting an AI education business is smart because you're putting yourself in the way of this massive amount of demand that's coming very soon and is already underway like with AI Consulting starting an AI education business is also super accessible for beginners and the path from complete Ai and business Noob to making money from your AI education business is similar to the AI Consulting route firstly you'll need to learn the info that you'll eventually teach again we're covering the core skills you'll need in the next section of this video and you can watch YouTube and you can find a coach or a mentor anything to help you get that initial bit of information that's going to allow you to eventually teach one day secondly you'll want to identify a part of the AI Market that you want to specialize in education for thirdly you want to condense your knowledge into an info product and this this can be something like a course or an ebook or a paid Community Etc and finally you need to drive customers to your business through content ads Partnerships and more that may sound super scary and difficult for you but I promise it's a lot more straightforward than you think as soon as I say business it sounds big and scary but when it comes to the day-to-day actions you need to take it's fairly straightforward it's setting aside 1 to two hours per day to learn the knowledge you'll one day teach and then you can start to put together your first little education product EG an ebook and then you need to pick some kind of strategy to attract customers and stick with it until you're getting traction how exactly you can attract customers to your business and make your first sales as covered in the step-by-step strategy in the final section and final chapter of this video it's important to realize that you don't need to hit a home run the first time big businesses are going to take a long time to build and for many of you this will be your first business and there are so many skills that you will pick up along the way but these skills take time to accumulate and really to set into part of your character and been build into you that's why starting off small and getting the ball rolling and giving yourself the time to adapt to being a business owner is so key every single one of you watching this video can go and research a topic in Ai and create some kind of ebook around it that's your foothold that's your foot in the door that's from where you can continue to keep expanding your knowledge until you're the best in your industry or the niche that you've chosen there are levels to the game and you can't take any shortcuts between them you just need to start small and learn along the way so in summary the way you create value and make money as an AI education business owner at least in the short term is to create some kind of info product that effectively condenses the chaos of the AI space into a concentrated dose of knowledge to help people understand Ai and how it affects them in their job or their business or their personal life some examples of AI education businesses you could start could be Master content creation for AI full course for solopreneurs or AI crash course for CEOs how to navigate the next 5 years or master open AI GPT building a beginner's guide to AI agents well I mean you can do something like AI literacy program for teams prepare your children for success in the AI age these are all just ideas that I came up with and of course you needed a little bit more research but it shows you how many different angles you can take and how many opportunities and niched opportunities to do AI education there are within the space I'd happily make an entire video on AI education businesses alone so if you're interested in that and want me to make a video again let me know down below I'll be making videos based off what comments I see the most of and most likes and stuff like that so go down there comment leave likes on other people who are commenting about it as well business type number three is an AI agency experience required to start is none startup costs can be $300 or more depending on the software you choose to use the time to profit is again around 3 months and the long-term potential of an AI agency in my opinion is high an AI automation agency or more broadly an AI agency is an AI business model that I first discovered and popularized in 2023 the the official definition of an AI automation agency that I pinned in July of 2023 was an online business model focused on helping small to mediumsized businesses to automate their systems and processes with AI technology essentially the AI agency business model is built on top of this historical Trend that with any new technology like web or smartphone apps a middle layer of businesses always appears who specialize in the new technology and help businesses all around the world to adopt it and benefit from of the gains that it can provide since this time last year I've been running my own six and almost seven figure AI agency morning site AI which has allowed me to generate consistent cash flow and support a team of expert AI developers without agencies like morning side businesses would struggle to know how to benefit from the gains new technology like AI can provide and they lack the resources to build these systems themselves these middle layer Industries like web app and blockchain development companies are worth billions once the technology has reached Mass adoption now I know you're thinking how the am I going to build an AI development company I can't code and I don't know the first thing about software well do I have good news for you last year I laid out the three tiers of AI automation agency Services which I've simplified down to no code Solutions low code Solutions and custom coded Solutions this three tier structure allows for you to enter the AI agency space at whatever skill level you have EG as a developer you can jump straight into the custom coded Solutions but if you're a complete beginner you can start with the no code side of things in the next chapter of this video will be going through a crash course on the core AI business skills that you need to succeed no matter which tier you jumping in at as an AI agency owner you get to choose the level of complexity of the solutions that you offer for example if you're just starting out you can literally start by upselling other people's software there are some awesome plug andplay chatbot and automation companies that allow you to make customer support assistance and lead generation chatbots and and appointment sets all you need to do is enter your client's info test it and then deploy it for them I can do a whole video on my recommended platforms if you'd like so let me know down below if you want that but getting super familiar with all these insane AI tools that are coming out every day and using the hard work of these software companies to deliver handy AI solutions to businesses is accessible to anyone you can even start on Fiverr and list yourself there and just build their solution in 10 minutes on someone else's solution using this method all you're doing is really finding the tools and connect the business owner to them and taking money in between this is known as Arbitrage and there's there's nothing unethical about it in fact one of the most successful agency owners in my AI agency accelerator Mark got started using this exact same method of going off fivr and finding Cool Tools and offering services and fulfilling with the tools like it's it's not rocket science and it's an easy way for people to get started if you don't have a super deep development background these little projects can make you a few hundred here and there and it would allow you to stack up some monthly recurring income so you could be saying $200 per month for you to prepare and maintain a chat B for your clients but once you've got the ball rolling with other people's software from there you can start to work on your skills or hire your first developer with some of the cash that you've got and start to explore some more tailored but still low code Solutions like building gpts for businesses or AI agents there's a whole ecosystem of these platforms that are a little bit more complex and allow for a little bit more customization and therefore require a little bit more skill but once you're familiar with these tools and these platforms you can now service a wider pool of customers and charge more for your services because you can do it to a lot more customiz it and customize it to their needs much better than you could with some of these like plug andplay AI tools these more custom projects that are built on low code software can hit you anywhere from $11,000 a piece to up to $10,000 or more and I'm not just plucking these out of the a this is from my own experience of running my agency then from there once you've built up your experience and you have some capable developers on your team you can start to accept fully custom coded projects which can be worth tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars my agency Morningside AI regularly Services clients worth 15 to $30,000 and have even recently finished delivering our first sixf figure client worth $120,000 there are a huge range of methods to get clients as an AI agency and this is something I'll be breaking down extensively in the final chapter of this video within the step-by-step guide as you can see there's a lot more upside to starting an AI agency than the previous models but it definitely takes a lot more work work if you want to break to that I'd say 20 to 30k per month level but for those long-term thinkers building a successful AI agency also opens up more doors to Future opportunities as with cash flow and a capable team of AI developers you have the ability to take bits on things like SAS and other areas that 99% of people do not have access to in October of last year I did exactly this from our own work as a development company and through what I was seeing my students struggle with I identified that there was a need for a certain type of AI software and because I had the cash flow and because I had the development team I was able to build it and create my first SAS called agentive and now I go from the opportunity of an AI agency which yes can make a lot of money but probably won't sell for a lot and now I've jumped into this AI SAS Arena and that opens up much bigger opportunities and much higher exit potential than if I was just sticking with the agency itself as AI agencies are my area of expertise as an agency owner myself and the teacher of the AI agency model to over 35,000 people within my community in the final section of this video I'll be giving you a step-by-step guide on starting your own AI agency in 2024 and how to leverage this business model to build the life of your dreams business type number four is an AI SS experience required to start this is high the startup cost can be $50,000 or more for developers marketing and admin staff the time to profit may be 6 to 12 months or more but the longterm potential is huge in my opinion AI SAS or software as a service is all the rage right now and for good reason to be fair it combines the SAS business model with the seemingly Limitless potential of AI technology meaning it's like candy for investors and aspiring entrepreneurs like you and I as sassis where you build some kind of software and provide it to your customers in most cases via the web and instead of the customers purchasing the software one off and owning it they pay for access to it when they need it offer on a monthly or yearly subscription of course you know a whole bunch of sasses you're probably subscribed to it like Spotify Netflix and things like this I've included the AI sass business model within this video as while not bter friendly at all I do need to plant the seed for you now so that you can see how it fits into the overall AI business landscape sort of how you could potentially navigate your way towards an AI SASS and sort of the big opportunities the AI space has to offer creating ass sass involves several key steps and resources that are each one of them is hard enough on their own firstly as idea generation you need to be able to identify a problem that can be solved through a software solution or an AI software solution in this case this could be through market research user feedback or identifying gaps in current software offerings second step is planning and design you need to outline the features the user interface the user experience of the SAS this involves wireframing userflow diagrams detailed specifications for your software and more thirdly you need to build the thing and go into a development phase where you will actually build the software you'll need to hire a team of developers and pay them quite a lot of money if they're skilled in various coding languages like JavaScript Python and of course being AI experts and llm experts as well then you need to go through a rigorous testing phase to ensure that your software actually works which is a pretty painful process if I'm being honest from from my own experience of running a software company and finally you need to deploy it and maintain it so once your software is ready you got to put it out on the servers make it available to your users and then constantly update it AKA a lot of constant work and that's not even the last of it number six is marketing and sales now that You' made your offer you need to actually promote it and get uses to it which is a whole thing on its own and something I'm not going to get into in this video so if you couldn't tell from that creating a sass is a resource intensive process requiring a skilled development team a significant amount of time and effort and a substantial Financial investment for development hosting maintenance marketing and more however with the right idea and execution a SAS can provide a stream of recurring revenue for you and set you up for a huge payout if you're one day able to sell the business I'm talking hundreds of millions or billions of dollarss business type number five is AI freelancing The Experience required to start this is medium your startup cost could be around $200 depending on the courses you buy time to profit can be around 2 months and the long-term potential of an AI freelancer in my opinion is high AI freelancing in this case refers to becoming a freelance AI developer the demand for AI Solutions is exploding and working as an AI freelancer helping companies and individuals with their AI needs can be a great path for those of you with a solid development background while not something I focus on as this isn't an AI developer Channel my friend Dave does focus on this exact thing and has an excellent program for developers who want to train or upskill as a developer to become an AI engineer if you want to learn more about this pathway and how you can build a career in the AI space as a developer I'll leave a link down below to Dave's Channel if you want to check it out in my opinion the long-term potential for AI development Freelancers is actually quite high as you can build up an extensive knowledge of how AI can help businesses and get great exposure to the opportunities that are throughout the industry in general from there you can easily pivot to any of the business models we've already discussed for example adding some more staff and hiring another developer to separate yourself from actually delivering the services and creating an AI agency or picking a specific solution that you buil for a client and say wow that's really cool I think I could do something here and creating a sass around that particular solution or that particular AI use case that you found as you can probably tell there really is something for everyone in the AI space right now regardless of your skill level okay we're back again different day same shirt um please leave like or subscribe whatever you want to do down there um this is obviously I'm putting a ton of work into this video for you guys so this little midpoint of the video I'd really appreciate if you do like this kind of content you have got something out of it so far and you are excited for what's coming could you please hit down below and subscribe to the channel for more AI business content like this really supports me and encourages me to continue to make big videos like this and put a lot of effort and cond it all into one setting for you guys so unfortunately for me it's not one setting to film it but um it is good for you guys to be able to BU watch it in one session rather than over a bunch of different videos so please like comment subscribe whatever you need to do on there just support me and then me creating these kind of videos so the final thing we need to cover for this chapter in particular is now mapping out how all these different business types can actually knit together over months or years into a long-term strategy that will allow you to tap the AI Boom for everything it has to offer this is really where the AI space and the opportunities inside can shine as there is really no cap on how you can progress into bigger and better types of businesses as you progress for example with an smma you can generate cash flow but there aren't any really super obvious next moves and how you can progress that to a better opportunity as you built up marketing resources which really limit your options in terms of what your next moves could be however with an AI business like an AI automation agency by having the cash flow the AI experience and the development team all three of those you have the means to be able to really start shooting at any opportunity you see in the AI arena with building software Etc over the past five months I've tried all of these businesses that we've covered except one freelancing but I have progressively worked my way up from what was essentially $300 Consulting calls uh to every my own AI sets which for my goals and where I want to go is the best vehicle for me to put my time into so in the final chapter of this video I'll be sharing my step-by-step system and strategy for starting your own AI business that sets you up for Success the first time around now your goal may not be to make hundreds of millions of dollars but planning and understanding your in goal and seeing how you can transition your success with the more basic business model like Consulting onto the one that you ideally want to build your wealth with over the longterm and have long-term success with is so key to having the conviction to stick to your plan over a long period of time so knowing where you want to go understanding that this basic more maybe one that you don't enjoy as much but understanding that the work you're doing in those initial phases of those more basic business models is the groundwork and and key steps you need to do to get to the eventual business model that you want to run and really build your wealth with over the long term to quote one of my favorite philosophers senica which I think is appropriate here if one does not know to which Port one is sailing no wind is favorable and from habit 2 of Steven K's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People begin with the end in mind and that's exactly what we're trying to do here so understanding what your end goal is and that will allow you to better map out the steps going through so I've actually got a diagram that I've put together here that gives you as best as I could some kind of uh outline of how you can progress from these different more basic business models into the better and sort of not necessarily better but bigger opportunities like sass long term so we're going to jump on screen now and we're going to do a little breakdown of those different opportunities and how they link together okay so here we have on screen a bit of a breakdown we have the business models we've just covered of course it's quite exciting getting on the getting on the keys here anyway AI Consulting AI education ai freelancer ai agency and AI SS and we have the phase one phase 2 and phase three now these are arbitrary in that there's no there not an exact science but this just gives you a general idea of how you can transition and what kind of limits you might expect from different business models so um first of all start off with Consulting um that can go through uh phase one you can be making sort of 0 to 20K per month Consulting I think I was up to about $10,000 a month at sort of the peak of my Consulting um and that wasn't even when I was fully focused on it so I'm sure some of you can figure out how to get a sort of nice little Consulting business going with your LinkedIn Outreach or LinkedIn content posting and or YouTube Etc but then when you get to sort of the 20K per month I think at some point it's going to become more worthwhile to transition that knowledge and experience into a better vehicle for you to scale more long term so Consulting can very easily move into education of course you've learned a whole bunch you've seen how a certain area can benefit or certain AI Technologies can benefit a certain type of Avatar or niche as you've nich down to some kind of area um then you can move into the AI education space and start to make educational products for the people or the clients that use you service so asking some of your clients and like hey what what kind of resources would this be helpful if you had some kind of course or ebook or Community to to help learn and understand this stuff better and that should kind of reveal itself over time if there's an obvious option for a uh for an education offer uh within that but at the same time you can also transition it down to starting an AI agency um now of course if you aren't don't have a technical background you will again still be kind of lost on the or blind on the technical side of things but as I mentioned you can start up with a lower code things now that you have experience and understanding of these different ways AI can help a business you can transition that into starting an AI agency you might be able to find a technical co-founder and say hey look I want to partner with you on this I've got all these clients who are super interested and this is the exact same route I took I took AI Consulting and I went into an AI agency and what that allowed me to do is capture more value from my Consulting calls by then upselling them to AI development services so people were constantly saying hey look thanks for this Consulting call but how do I can you help me build this thing like can you can you do the next step for me and that was when morning side AI became a thing and we started being able to deliver and capture more uh value out of those calls by uh by delivering the services as well so AI agency a Consulting to AI agency fairly straightforward route um then we have the AI education business model which I think would scale quite well as as myself and my team are currently scaling sort of into into phase two and and potentially phase phase three sometime soon uh but a education offers uh being infoproduct based thing they're a lot more scalable so they can push past this 0 to 20K per month Mark and technically they could go to a million or more it could definitely scale past 200k a month into the sort of 200 to a million per month range but I think for for the purposes of this diagram I think it's good to show that you can then transition it into the final one down here which is sass which we'll get to in a bit um then the AI freelancer route again you can start as a as a newbie or beginner making no money if you are a developer have a development background and the AI freelancer route opens up some great opportunities for you like being able to go up here and jump into AI education you might deliver a whole bunch of cool things for clients and you might go okay I want to show other developers there's a mess Mar Market of people who are developers and want to get into the AI space because they know how much money is in it and and what sort of prospects it has for their future career if you can make some kind of educational product and you can say here's how I was able to make money as an AI freelancer and be successful over time then it can sort of move into this education thing and you can run them simultaneously as well you could be doing your freelancing um and your education but I think when they're combined it's a bit more on this on this path here um pushing up to that 200k per month Mark um and then again eventually gets down to the disaster r as well uh then we have the AI agency again you can start from from zero as a beginner using these low code no Cod tools again you're not going to be making thousands of dollars a pot by reselling some no code jackpot we've been over this but it will allow you to get that experience and eventually hire developers if you need them to expand your skill set and it scales quite nicely as I've done with my business from 0 to 20K up to up to the 20 to 200k per month Mark now I think it would be quite difficult uh from my own experience um particularly in the the issue with with my agency at least from being fully transparent was hiring the right talent and for us at morning side we're like we have all these clients and all these projects we can deliver but we just we just can't get the right Talent hiring was taking so much time burning through so many developers that we brought on and even for myself as someone with a personal brand that can sort of attract or add more more uh wait to the offer when we say hey come with work with us and you get to be part of this team it still is very very difficult to find capable AI developers and they're very expensive as well so the thing that prevented us from continuing to scale morning side and just sort of accepting that we'll hold it at a certain level while we poor money to things like our SAS was that at this point uh we didn't have the the means to to hire effectively and continue to scale our development team um at the rate we wanted to go if we stayed in the uh in the Agency Route necessarily so that's what we did is we transitioned our development resource and the cash flow we're getting from war side into a SAS play down here and this SAS is uh it doesn't connect here because I don't believe well yes you will go through the the 0 to 20K and 20 to 200k phases of your SS um I still think that having a line here would be a bit misleading showing that you can start a sass um without the resources required like an agency or or anything to back it up so that kind of illustrates how the SAS opportunity is really only something you can get to in this sort of advanced stage maybe instead of phase three I should have called it Advanced um so that you really understand that there's there's different levels to this game and this sass route down the end if you can get there and you have the resources and it makes sense again I'm not saying this is the only route you can get your education business and blow through a million a month I'm sure if you have the right team and you have the right strategy um but the SAS rout is particularly attractive to myself as I think we're in this bubble not a bub I probably would be a bubble let's be honest but at a certain point um there's going to be ridiculous valuations we are at a economic climate where not many things are looking too good for people so the all the money is flowing into this booming really only sector that's booming which is AI at the moment um and there's opportunities for like in the Doom bubble and boom bubble boom so there but that in in that era there was companies being sold for billions and billions of dollars um that I mean they might not exist now but there was still a lot of money to be made for people like q and I starting software businesses and selling them um during the the the most intense level of that of that hype I think the AI SAS play is particularly good because you can get these ridiculous events and you're just really putting yourself in the in the way of luck if you are strategic and you do have a good strategy to launch run and grow your SS I'll be adding this as a resource on the free school community so if you haven't already signed up head down to the link in the description and you'll be able to join my free community and as I mentioned all the other resources that are included with this video this the the perfect promp template things like that the AI auditing checklist which you're going to be uh going over in the next section of this video all of that's going to be included on the school so you can join there for free check it all out and'll get all the free Resources with this video so what I want you to do now is to pause this video and take a a long moment to think about your long-term goals maybe you want to be building a cash flowing business and travel the world for a few years that's completely fine that's what I've done I highly recommend it but you should also have a rough plan of when and how you will progress from these kind of cash flow businesses into bigger opportunities my plan could be something like like I'm going to start as a consultant I'm going to spend two months studying Ai and and how it can benefit businesses and then working on my social Presence at the same time then I'll spend maybe the next 4 months hopping on as many calls as I can and researching wherever the trail of questions from my clients leads me and once I have sufficient experience I'll then try to find a technical co-founder to partner with me on an AI ageny agency and begin to drive my Consulting clients to my agency as an upsell while continuing to grow my social presence to generate leads for the business over the next 12 months I'll consistently work on delivering client projects and show a great option for niching down as an agency to build like a kind of micro SAS arise or even to build a full platform out I'll prototype and test ideas until we're ready to move into SAS full-time of course dates and timelines never work like this never workers expected I think it's a Mike Tyson quote everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face uh you are going to have a plan until you get punched in the face by business but it's handy to have a plan to stick to one thing for long enough it's easy to get distracted and move on before you've put in the Rifts needed to build your foundation so pause this video and take a moment now to plan out a rough ideal timeline and plan for your AI business Journey once you finish your crash course on the core AI business skills that every AI entrepreneur must have in the next section you'll be ready to take action on my step-by-step strategy in the final chapter of this video Chapter Three core AI business skills the skills you're about to learn what myself and thousands of other agents here owners in my community use daily to identify build and refine the solutions we sell to our clients regardless of the business model you choose these skills will form a solid foundation for you to build your business on and put you in the top 1% of people in the AI space right now however there's only so much you can learn from watching a video like this the real knowledge of course always comes from applying these skills to your own projects and to those of your clients and customers skill number one prompt engineering the quality of those instructions directly determines the quality of the output therefore if you're good at prompt engineering you can extract more value out of these models than the other person or your competition that's why it is absolutely crucial as an AI business the good news is is that it's not actually that hard there's a few key tricks that you need to learn that will put you in the top 1% again of people prompting these models so get your notebook out for this bit as these tips are what you'll use on a daily basis and really are your first step up from a beginner to AI to someone who is better than average at using AI these are really the main levers that you can use to squeeze better performance out of your AI systems trick number one is called roll prompting this is pretty basic one where you're telling the AI who or what it is for example you are an expert email classifier capable of perfectly analyzing and categorizing emails into the following types B your prompts typically should start with some kind of roll prompt like this to clearly outline who the AI is and what they're supposed to do it's been provement to help the outputs if you kind of gas the gas the model up for a lack of a bit of term and tell out how good it is say you're an expert you're very good at doing this if you can include things like that like you are the best in the world or you are an expert it will actually perform better and give better output so that's just a little trick as well next tip we have is shot prompting so the amount of shots in a prompt refers to the number of input and output examples that you've provided and Shop prompting is by far the most powerful tool for letting the AI know how it should respond this something that I think not enough people use but it's really what the most powerful thing that I use on a daily basis for prompting the way shot prompting works is by providing examples of the most common inputs and writing the desired response that you want from it the AI can clearly see the tone and style and length and structure of the responses you want it to give for example if you're building a customer support assistant for a business you can provide examples on how it should respond to the trickiest questions and also how it should reply to the most common questions or if you're making a tool that classifies emails you can provide 10 examples of input emails and then the correct classification as the output EG interested as a that you wanted to Output I recommend providing at least two to three examples in the following format of Q colon next line a colon and then that's how you can input the question as the input so it might be the input for the previous example would be the email the input of the email that is going to be sent to this uh this AI to classify in future so Q would be an email example and then a would just be the label you want so if you do QA QA QA three different examples that will tell the AI very closely how you want it to respond to things they highly recommend you put this on pretty much every prop that you do this trick alone will massively improve the quality and performance of your props tip number three is Task context I found that providing enough context to the AI about the task it is doing and and why can be the difference between good and a great prompt so of course you don't want to go overboard as the more bloated The Prompt gets with with more words uh the less it listens to the the really key instructions of the task for example with the email classifier example by telling the AI you are a key part of our sales funnel as when the customer fills out contact form on our website an email is sent to our inbox which you they need to categorize into X Y or Z we are only interested in customers who meet X criteria so it's crucial that you mark these customers as why so that they are passed directly onto our sales team to contact for an appointment this kind of extra context around the task can really help it to understand where it fits into things and and as I said take a prompt from good to Great prompting tip number four is markdown formatting this is a more recent addition to my prompting tool bout and is something that has really done wonders for me dialing in the prompts of particularly AI agents for building on my my SAS agentive and for other particularly tricky tasks marown as a way of formatting plain text intended to be easy to read and easy to write making it a popular choice for formatting things like read me files or writing messages and online discussion forums and stuff like that what it basically does is gives us a way to better structure our prompts as I'm sure you know by now you can't add headings or lists bals into the prompts that you typically give to something like cat gbt but by using markdown formatting we are able to let it know where a heading would be or where a list and bolts would be so it's using markdown formatting inside of our prompt and it may look silly when you write it but it has actually been proven to lead to better performance as the models themselves have actually been trained on a lot of data that has markdown so it's been trained to recognize this kind of formatting I understand okay that's a heading okay that's a that's a list and it actually makes them perform better so it's something that I've only recently learned from my CTO Spencer and something that I use in basically all of my really important prompts now I've actually got a perfect prompt template that I I personally use which I'm happy to share with you guys to save you guys the hassle uh this thing has been refined quite a lot to work for for most use cases in particular when you're creating AI agents I'll leave a link to the perfect prom template on my free school community that we've launched recently so if you guys want to jump on to there it's again it's 100% free you can check out the perfect prom template and all other resources that will be associated with this video Once you request to join it will take a few minutes for you to be accepted then you can find the post uh with the resources for this video under the YouTube tab so there'll be a tab for YouTube there'll be a reference to this video and then inside that would be this the perfect prompt template and all the other resources for this video and the final tip for improving your prompt is to use the model settings now these are really for finer tweaks to help you with uh really refining the outputs there are things like temperature top PE frequen penalty and more and these are a little bit more Technical and kind of outside the scope of this video but luckily for you I've already done a complete beginners and advanced guide on prompt engineering here on this channel and that's going to teach you everything you need to know to be able to use these model settings as well so I go super in depth on these model model settings in the in the advanced guide so if you want to watch those and really fill out your prompt engineering skill set those will be linked down below and you can watch them right after this one once you L the foundational Concepts like roll prompting and fot prompting Etc you can then start to use some the powerful prompting tools like prompt expert gpts that can really do most of the heavy lifting for you a student of mine Isaiah is actually an expert in NLP and has created a GPT for this exact purpose for prompt writing and he's happy to share it with the community so I'll leave this on the school again in the resources you can go down below to the description head over to school sign up there'll be a link on the post related to this video it has a link to this perfect prompt Rider GPT which will help you to incorporate everything you just learned and get it to generate your prompts on demand again to reiterate the quality of your prompts determines the value you can extract from these models so it is extremely important to get this right and build a solid foundation on the skill particularly the good news for you is that it's getting easier and easier to write good prompts with these tools are gbts course go number two is understanding apis now throughout your time and the AI space you'll often hear about apis these are essentially the backbone of software communication and not to overload you with technical jargon apis are what allow different programs and softwares to talk to one another in this space we often use tools like voice flow which is a chatbot Builder we have air table which is kind of like XL on steroids we have relevance AI which is a AI tool building platform and we have zapia and even my own platform agentive often in order to create some kind of AI system or or solution you'll need to combine number of these different tools together and unless they have some kind of plug andplay integration that comes out of the box with the platform um which is highly highly unlikely they don't really have those at a lot of cases you will need to use apis to send data between these different softwares and also to trigger things at certain times like send an API call to trigger is app if you're already handy with apis feel free to jump ahead and Skip onto the next skill uh but for those of you who are complete beginners and uh interested in learning about how apis work I'll now outline the core parts of an API call I want you to note these down in your notebook as this stuff took me weeks to probably get my head around when I was trying to learn it so if this is a little bit difficult for you don't worry I had the exact same problems when I was starting and it's completely normal to have difficulties when you're wrapping your head around this so in this next section I'll be trying to save you from the circles that I went around when learning apis so when you use an API you are loading a URL same as when you put in google.com into your browser and you hit enter what you're doing when you do that is you're requesting info from Google server required to load the web page and present the Google homepage so when you request it by hitting enter and loading that URL Google server sends back the code required to load the web page and HTML CSS or whatever language I'm sure Google's do it in essentially sends back what's required to be loaded as the web page and presented and your browser is built around essentially unpacking this information and loading it for you and presenting it on the page when it comes to connecting different softwares you may be using in Your Service delivery with apis you're also going to be making a request to a server for example requesting air table for some some kind of information stored in your spreadsheet and then air table will send back this data and then you can use it throughout your application your voice flow chatbot or on agentive for lead capturing for example I might create a lead generation agent or chatbot with my software agentive and include in it a lead capture tool and what the sleeve capture tool is going to do is to request to air table once it has the information from the user asking it to store the email in the name that I've collected on one of my spreadsheets or on one of my tables and it would then store that as a new lead in my database and it would reply to me confirming that the action was successful so I request the information to be stored and I give it the information it needs and then once it's stored and everything's done it's going to send back its response to me saying yep all good everything's done um this operation has been completed successfully so sometimes when you calling apis you're going to be requesting information this is typically known as a get request and sometimes you're going to be sending information away to whatever service it is this is known as a post request there are a bunch of other HTTP methods which is what get and post are there're different types of HTTP methods but I don't want to overload you with too much information now just get is to request to get information in many cases and posting is posting some data up to the API for it to process and typically store create some new record or basically just storing information key thing to understand is that when you are using apis you are sending requests either a request to receive info or as we said a request to store info and the software that you're communicating with will send back some kind of response and in the case of a get request this may be a whole bundle of data or information if you make a get request to air table it might send back a whole bunch of information from a spread sheeet but if you are sending a post request all you'll probably get back from a post request when you're saying hey here's all this information can you please store that somewhere it's not going to send much back to you in most cases it will just send a short confirmation like yep all sweet we've got that information stored successfully now I want to briefly run through the core components of an API call again you need to be taking notes here as you'll likely be using this multiple times a day once you're in the trenches and actually building a business and it may sound a little bit overwhelming but I promise at the end I'll tie it all together nicely with a real world analogy of a pizza shop to make it all click in your head so the first component of API is known as the base URL this is the main web address of the API or service that you're trying to access for example if we used the shipping example it would be like the building name or the address of the building um and that's really what we start when we're starting to make a request this could be something like a subdomain where it's API do your service.com and then that's like the base URL right in many cases this will just be the domain of the website or service that you're using use a Google example would be google.com/ API slv1 that might be the the base URL of the the service that you're interacting with secondly we have the endpoint this is like the specific apartment in the building so the base URL represents the building and the endpoint represents a specific apartment to deliver the service to or package to if we're using a shipping example the input is essentially part part of the web address that we're the URL that we're loading that we add onto the end of the base URL so it might be google.com/ API slv1 SLG address or that's kind of like the endpoint is the different services that they'll provide um different inp points are typically created for you to be able to access different services off that base URL so it might be get address get coordinates different Services we have different endpoints so it's like the specific service you're looking at Under the Umbrella of the base URL of the the service or the company that you're interacting with next we have HTTP methods which I mentioned before these are essentially just classifying different types of requests so if you wanting to retrieve data it would be a get request if you're wanting to create data it would be a post request if you're wanting to update data you'd be using a put request if you're trying to remove data you'd be using a delete request or if you want to partially update data you'd be using a patch it's a little bit too advanced for now you just hit a no post and get that'll get you through most of the stuff you need to do with your own software next we have the headers of an API call these are the extra details that help you describe what you're asking for or to really give more information about the request you can think of this as where you describe things like the type of parcel you're sending like the headers of this packaging example would be a letter versus a box and typically you'll see when it comes to the stuff that you're you're doing and things like voice flow and air table the main thing will be things like authentication which we're going to touch on next and the content type so when these apis are communicating with each other they need to know what format to expect that information next we have parameters of your request so these are like the filters or the specific instructions that tell the service exactly what information you want next we have authentication and this is essentially some kind of password or Seeker key that proves that you have permission to access a service because if you didn't have some kind of authentication when you are making these requests making these API calls then anyone could cop on and make calls to any API and then cause all sorts of I mean there there's cost associated with running these apis if it's a Google thing and it's like the Google Maps API they want to obviously be paid for providing that API as a service uh so they need to get you to go through the process of setting up an account putting billing on then you get your API key and then you can include that in your request to prove yes I'm a member I'm paying for this D and every time you do a request it's going to be checking that you've got credit Etc so it's authenticating essentially how you're you're paying for the service in many cases next we have the response and this is the data or information that the server sends back the API will send back to you after processing a request so as I said for the get request this will often be the data that you requested if it's a post request it might just be a confirmation like yep all good we've stored that or if it's a delete request it'll be like yep we've successfully deleted that um and it's just kind of a confirmation rather than sending a whole lot of information that you need to save and and use within your application and finally thought i' throw this one in as well there's error handling that goes on with these with these API calls when things don't go as planned the API will send back into error code and messages telling you what went wrong so I won go into it now but is like 404 is a common one when you go onto a web page just make up a random URL you'll hit enter and it will try to get the information to load that page and then we'll go oh well that we don't have that page that's not a not a valid endpoint for our site um and so automatically send back the 404 page and say hey look you're looking for something that we don't have there's nothing here for us to load the other one that you'll see quite often is a 200 response and 200 is just basically like yep all sweet everything went fine now to add a bit of context to all the stuff we've just learned we can use this pizza shop example which is kind of my go-to for explaining this the base URL would be the public phone number of the pizza shop the end point would be the extension that you need to call that pizza shop in order to order pizza vers booket tables let's pretend that this particular pizza shop has extensions that are set up in order to allow you to access different things like order a pizza or to book a table like dine in or or takeway essentially so let's pretend that you have to dial up the base URL which is the whole phone number and then the extension in order to get through to what you're looking to get so say if I'm looking to book a table I'd have to call up the base URL the phone number of the business and the extension and then when when I get on the line I can give it the information I need if we are looking to place a new pizza order we might be making a post request so sending some data to the order of pizza extension and the headers may contain key info about our order like whether or not it's home delivery or pickup the parameters would be the specific details about our order that we would give over the phone for example the type of pizza or the size of the pizza the toppings Etc the authentication in this case will be giving our payment over the phone to gain access to the pizza delivery service and the response of course would be the pizza arriving at your door if there were any kind of errors just like they out of stock a particular ingredient cashier would provide that as a reason that's the same as providing the error message back to you in the response that apis will typically do if there's a problem I hope that'll make sense I know it could be a lot to get in one go but I just rewatch it a couple of times here's what an API block looks like on most of the apps that you'll be using um so pause the video now take a moment to kind of connect all the dots each of the things you've noted down in your notebook you should be able to see a field for them and once that's all filled out you can hit the send button and it will send the request and it should send you back exactly what you're looking for theoretically of course if you were building this and some kind of software one final note here is that sometimes when you're doing post requests you will use the request body to send your data inste of parameters and this is typically done in Json and the structure needs to be exactly as the API expects Json is actually super easy to understand you just need to ask chbt to teach you how to write and understand it to learn the basics of Json and you'll be your way to the races I know that might have been a lot but this knowledge of apis is crucial to understanding the next skill which is by far one of the most versatile and high leverage opportunities in Tech right now for people like you and I skill number three is tool creation knowing how to build AI tools is a mandatory skill for anyone looking to make money in the AI space in my opinion even if you're not selling them to clients directly within the opportunity or business model that you choose to pursue using them internally within your own business to speed up things like workflows or automate whole processes is hugely powerful and it's something that you definitely need to be doing as an AI entrepreneur so what do I mean by a tool there is no real one definition for a tool is that can be used in many different ways but here's a breakdown of things and and some examples so in the most basic form tools are functions some functions expect inputs some don't some return and output others don't but basically when triggered these functions do something this could be interacting with some apis across the web or performing some calculations and data manipulations on the inputs you provided before returning the result back to the user or to whatever's on the other end a waiting it when you create tools you can use them in a number of different ways you can use them via a simple web page like Elance AI use page these are great because they can be used internally within your business or you can even build them for clients and send them that page for them to use and and get valuated as well you can also use tools via custom actions for gpts or AI agents which we'll be touching on more in a little bit you can also use them via API within a platform like voice flow or a table using the skills you've just got and final thing that you can do with them is actually bulk running these AI tools and functions on thousands of spreadsheet rows at a time basically creating some kind of AI function and then running it and using uh using rows of a a spreadsheet as the input so you can kind of run through the whole thing at once and create new values and stuff like that which I think is super cool and it's actually very valuable when done correctly in many cases for you and I the simplest use case for tools is taking in some text inputs running it through one or more llm or or chat gbt step uh that we've pre- prompted and then returning the answer or the result from that AI step this stuff can be difficult for you to wrap your head around when I'm just talking at you like this so I'm going to jump quickly onto my computer here and I'll give you a little demo of relevance Ai and examples of a couple tools so that you can actually conceptualize what the hell I'm talking about here so I apologize if you've been struggling but I want to throw this bit in so that you can actually connect the dot here so relevance AI they'll be linked out in the description if you want to check them out there um but over here I've signed in and created an account you can see the dashboard of some of the tools that I've made prior um now a couple good examples I can jump in and show you um this AI agent perfect front Rider is probably a good start so here I'll edit this one and you can see here if I zoom things up we have our user inputs in this case I've got the agent name the agent context Etc you can pause it and just take a little look here at these things what this is going to do is create a perfect prompt for your AI agent uh it goes down here Etc so these are all inputs that the tool is going to expect and then I have this simple this is the most simple example of a of a tool like I mentioned is just inputs into a llm step in this case I prompted it with all this good stuff to tell it how to write a prompt and the key thing is that it inserts the values from the inputs up here again all no code these inputs that you provide or whenever the user uses it it's going to insert those inputs here cuz I've clicked and referenced all these different variables so each time this runs it's going to take the information from those inputs and it's going to inject it into this prompt and it's going to give me the output down here so if I uh you can run it within here so if I filled all of these out um gave it a and I could go run all and I'd give get the output here but the more interesting thing for us is that we can then create all this sa for a client or sa for internal use within our company and we can click this use tab and then we get three different options here so we have the sharable app which if I click on this and I copy this and I open this up in a new tab this will give us a nice web page for either my team internally to use this or if I was an agency or a freelancer I can create these for clients then I could send these URLs as as proof of service Del Liberty and say Hey look here's a tool either to test it before we move forward or like here's the here's the deliverable that you are asking for so I can go through here and give it uh name lead gen assistant um agent context lead generation expert for my website conversions capture lead I'm being pretty brief as you can imagine at lead capture tool is provided ideal I'll put um uh none let's skip that for now don't have time no it's on style B proit let's go Talk Like a Pirate and be very very brief in your responses knowledge context you have a document with my company info and if I run the tool it's going to go through all that take those inputs inject it into that llm pre- prompted llm step and I created and it's going to Output the kind of prpt that I'm looking for now this is just one example of a use case um here you go here's the output so rooll actors Legion assistant specifics tools Etc so you can use the same thing for as we'll see a little bit later uh you can use it for short form generation there's all sorts of cool stuff you can do here um go back to this Ed tab we can also uh embed this snippet onto a website if you want to we can allow other people to clone this as a template um if you want to share it away as an educational resource for your education business you can go run and bulk on here which I think is super cool that I mentioned before I can upload a spreadsheet of data and I can use each of these columns as the inputs that we provided in this previous step so whatever inputs you have I can say okay for each row I want to use the Aging context for this variable and this for this this for this and then when it runs it it's going to strip that whole line insert it in generate the prompt so if I had this spreadsheet filled with uh information on a bunch of different agents that I wanted to make prompts for I could do them all in one go without having to go back and fourth then finally you can use this as an API uh we can copy this this is the end point again see you starting to connect these dots here um you need to make a Json request body like this um and you can use this within your app so say using a voice flow example or using it on ative as a tool for your AI agent uh this is how you can use the tool that you create via API um which is pretty handy as well another quick example of a tool could be this General company research thing super basic again you can really get super Advanced with this over time if you choose to learn the platform and get better but essentially this is expecting one input a company website URL we put in the URL it's being saved to this variable then let go to extract the website con tip um using relevance as built-in web scraper so it's going to extract that URL let's go to give it out as text and we're going to have a couple llm steps well pass it into there and then chain it up with another one you get to pick the different models you want to use Etc then it's going to Output it you're essentially able to become an AI developer and build these complex pipelines and tools without ever having to write code and by using simple things like built-in web scrapers API call blocks and stuff like this so I hope this has got you excited and this can really show you that you don't need to be a developer to build some really powerful AI apps in this case leveraging the web scraping tools and the sort of built-in llm blocks that rather but test allows you to do all sorts of cool things and if I click here there are so many different things that it can do all these AI tools um llm fine tune data all this stuff you can do with like LinkedIn convert Json slack calendar all sorts of cool stuff you can do Integrations um relevance just has a ton of cool stuff out of the box that you can start playing around with so hopefully that demo gave you a little bit more context on what a tool is what kind of ingredients you have how they come together how you can use them Etc the thing to understand is that many small to mediumsized businesses are already using chat gbt to assist with specific tasks however normally Within These companies it's done by being passing around these massive prompts around the business and expecting stuff to kind of use chat gbt to figure it out themselves with these prompts the way I see it one of the easiest ways to understand AI tools for businesses is that creating tools essentially allows you to streamline and standardize all of these tasks and ways they're using AI already uh into tools like I've just showing you there so you can streamline all these prompts and condense them into one sequence or Tool uh and then make that available via a use page or via a GPT or an agent and by centralizing that prompt into the tool then the business owner or yourself as the person who's building these systems for them you can go in whenever you need to update the prompt or change how the system outputs you make a couple changes and then you publish it and then everyone across the team has access to the exact same tools and it gets updated instantly rather than hey look here's the new prompt version for this this this made a couple changes it's a great way of streamlining things and standardizing it across a company especially if there's a lot of people involved you can then even take this a step further and instead of making them use a tool via input boxes on a web page you can actually connect that same tool and add any other tools want and put them all together into a GPT or an AI agent for the team to use this is really the magic of being able to create tools as they can be added into conversational agents and use as part of a a bigger mix of tools and sort of centralized all into one chatbot experience the way all of this links back into API is that we just covered is that when you wrap an API around a tool or around a function which is what you're creating you can call that API from within your AI agents and allow your chat Bots to do crazy powerful things for your users and while AI agents and gpts are a little outside of the scope of this video I have done a complete beginner guide on everything you need to know about gpts and how to deploy and set up your first AI agent step by step in this complete guide I go into far more depth on how tools can be attached and used by agents so I highly recommend you check out that video next and I'll link that in the description and also at the end of this video If you to watch after this it's really the perfect bit of content to watch after this as it teaches you actually how to apply a lot of the stuff I've just learned and start to create your first AI agents and and deploy them to different platforms as well like websites the good thing is that we have dozens of platforms to choose from that allow you to build simple or extremely complex Ai and llm based tools without needing to code and of course relance AI is my favorite and go-to for creating tools particularly for AI agents for example I'm personally in the process of creating a Content assistant AI agent or content assistant GPT that will help me to better repurpose my YouTube content so I want this to be just one chat bot where I can basically write run my whole personal brand and whole content repurposing process to do this I planned out a few different relevance tools that I need to make firstly a YouTube transcript to uh description generator a YouTube url to LinkedIn post generator a YouTube url to uh X or Twitter post generator uh a YouTube url to community post generator and a YouTube url to short form script generator as well so all these different things essentially taking a YouTube url it's going to load that pull the transcript and then turn that content and that transcript content into a bunch of these posts for different platforms that I can use and extract some of the the points I make from these big videos like this and put those onto different platforms as well all these tools are really is chaining a bunch of llm steps back to back and something like relevance and using my prompt engineering skills to split out a result that I'm happy with I can then connect up all of these to an agent on my platform agentive or create a GPT as well and there I can use it to generate all my content needs I can go on there and say hey here's the URL can you please generate me through three LinkedIn posts two x post three Community posts two short form scripts from this video past in the URL and it will automatically use all of those tools in the background and give me all of the posts that I'm looking to do so you can learn again how to do this on my gpt's full guide as I mentioned it'll be linked below um and also on the end screen of this video um and I've also got a short video on how to create tools with relevance AI that'll link down there as well so everything you need if you didn't understand any of that I have additional videos on to to really give more context to it I'm actually in the process of planning a much longer longer complete guide to AI tooling using relevance with multiple examples of tools built step by step in front of you so if you'd like me to rush that video out it's not really high in the pecking order at the moment um but let me know down in the comments below I'd be happy to uh push that out and I think if there's one skill you could Master to make money with AI it would be this kind of tooling next is AI auditing AI auditing refers to being able to figure out where AI can benefit in most cases a business this skill is really the thing that you will be building and compounding over the next few years in AI business essentially the ability to enhance a business with AI is kind of the meta skill of the the AI entrepreneur at this point the more clients you work with the more experience you will gain and the better you will get at identifying opportunities and deploying powerful AI solutions to create new value in these businesses the better you get at this skill this will obviously increase your value and therefore the value of the services you provide and the amount you're able to charge at the end of the day while the AI audit itself is kind of a questionnaire or a process you can do with a client to learn more about their business and identify ways that AI could help AI auditing also kind to refers to the broader skill of understanding how AI can benefit things and and businesses in particular as an AI agency owner or freelancer this is how you can convert AI curious business owners into paying customers by suggesting a high value system that excites them and as an educator this is how you can attract attention with your own content by sharing interesting ways that AI can help your target market and of course being a sass owner the big opportunities will lie in the B2B space businesses to business not necessarily the BTC space for the foreal future as open AI kind of cleans up on the BTC side with chat gbt the active performing in AI audit can be done on a discovery call with a potential client I actually have a complete AI audit checklist that you can get on my school my free community as I mentioned you can go down and click on the link there to go through to that and of course all of the other resources are on school as well I'd love to cover the AI audit checklist here but it's basically a big list of questions which isn't the most engaging content for you all so I think it's best if I put it as a resource and you can go on there and use that when you hop in your own calls and own Discovery calls you can run through this AI audit checklist and understand what you need to learn about a business to be able to recommend AI solutions to them long story short AI auditing as a skill refers to your ability to create value with AI by spotting an opportunity and being able to plan a solution around it now there's no shortcut for building the skill you just need to get on calls with clients and customers and get reps in of helping these people to benefit from Ai and build up your knowledge on this topic over time chat GPT coding AI businesses inherently involve software which means your ability to understand how software works is critical to your success and while historically to start a tech-based business you need to have either taught yourself the code and applied your learnings over 12 to 24 months or gone to college but with the release of chat gbt the game has completely changed for our benefit of course we are at a unique time in history where not only do you now have your your own free coding expert at your fingertips in the form of chat gbt who is literally ready to assist you with almost any coding t you could imagine we also in the middle of a kind of no code Revolution which is rapidly reducing the amount of actual code you need to write in order to create powerful software this is truly an incredible time to be an entrepreneur software businesses and the riches that they offer have never been more accessible to the average person like you so while knowing how to code is a great Advantage when coming into the AI business Arena if you want to call it that it is by no means mandatory if you can learn to leverage no code tools and chat GPT properly as a coding assistant let's be real though if you're not a developer you're not likely going to be able to make some production grade AI software through chat gbt that's why when you're starting an AI agency we have the three tiers of deliverables so you can jump in at a level you're comfortable and grow your experience and sort of learn as you go and increase through those tiers over time as you build more skills and more experience the reality is that the non-technical AI business owners typically use chat GPT for a few key things firstly understanding technical terms if you see some kind of coding term like an endpoint and you don't understand you can ask chat gbt and it will help you until you've got your headit around it secondly explaining code sometimes you run into code Snippets that you need explained on these kind of noow cod platforms ironically uh or the low code platforms list you can go back and forth with chat gbt to explain every part of that but a code that you're seeing thirdly chat gbt is great at writing basic scripts and the connecting kind of pieces of code that will connect your different services and softwares that you're using sometimes you may need to whip up a little bit of custom code to connect two of these softwares together as I said and chat BD can help you with writing this in seconds and finally in my opinion one of the most useful ways of using this is is planning your approach to building your solution when you have a new client or a new customer chat gbt can be a valuable consultant to help you to identify the right approach to building a solution including the software is required to achieve your end result here's a few handy strategies my community members have used to hack their coding abilities with chat gbt firstly you can create a coding shooter GPT by throwing in transcripts of YouTube videos from channels like free code camp and using it to plan and refine your work or you can create an AI Solutions expert GPT by adding in knowledge documents that outline of your favorite no Code and low code software that we use on this channel like air table and voice flow genive Etc and then you can ask a questions like hey how can I create this for my client and allow your GPT to plan your approach using the softwares that you're most comfortable with using if you want me to do a video showing you how you can create gpts like this let me know down Bel look chat gbt coding is a powerful skill and something that can massively increase your earning potential in the AI business space as it unlocks so many more things that you can sell final skill that's optional is content creation one skill that can be like rocket fuel for your AI business is content creation Now I'm speaking from personal experience here but we are so early in this AI space and in this wave that we're seeing if you can figure out content creation like I did last year then you can generate a essentially an infinite lead generation machine for your business and attract opportunities in the space to you rather than having to do the hard work of getting out there and finding them for yourself at morning side being fully transparent we have never run any ads or called email to get our clients every single one of them has come from my Channel or by a referral from a client you gave for my channel so if a video like this isn't your thing constant content posting on things like X or LinkedIn can be a good substitute if you guys would like some kind of guide on how to become an AI content creator um then I can definitely put together some kind of basic launch strateg or beginner's guide for you um Bas some more to work for me um but I won't go into depth here as I said it is an optional one but I think it is something that can be very very valuable especially at this time when these these new markets like AI are really fighting their feet and for myself at least from my own experience you can come and at sort of the ground level and then over the next 5 to 10 years really build your reputation as as one of the the ogs which we still have the opportunity to do now as a word of caution a big mistake I see a lot of bers make when they start to do content is try to do too much too soon so instead of trying to do all the platforms and being at all of them 6ck to one until you've mastered it and you'll get far better results that way as I did with YouTube I just focused on this and now I'm sort of expanding out to other platforms as well chapter 4 my step-by-step guide to starting an Ari business in 2024 and now what you all been waiting for my step-by-step system launching your own AI business in 2024 right well I hate to break it to you but I may have lied a little bit here um the Final Chapter won't be me yapping for another half an hour and trying to give you step-by-step instructions to start a business give me a second to explain my last one of these videos was created in July of last year and has since become outdated as the strategies to launch an AR business have changed I'm always basing my strategies and recommendations to people and students in my community of what I'm seeing from my own businesses and what I'm seeing other students succeed because I put so much effort into this video particular this time around I don't want this final section to ever end up giving you information or strategies that isn't 100% up to dat and in line with the best practices I'm seeing myself and in my community so to solve this problem of adapting my strategy over time in a rapidly moving space with static videos like this I've done more any any same person would do I built an entire n toin AI business education and coaching platform and before you plge your screen and discussed that I've just lowered you in only to get you to pay me you don't have to pay a dollar to use the software I've created well myself and the team at morning side have very creatively called aiam is a originally exclusive to my accelerator Community but for this particular video I've spent the past month rebuilding it from the ground up literally to have both a free and a paid route meaning that you can try it completely for free right now I have built AI Liam to be your personal AI business coach who was able to learn about your unique situation and recommend the perfect strategy for you this is because over over time and and countless interviews of students and talking to people in my community I realized that there's no one size fits or path for people who want to start an AI business for the past 6 months I've been I'm racking my brain trying to force myself to come up with this perfect clean line strategy that that's super simple for everyone but in the reality all of you have different backgrounds different experiences and some of those are are great strengths that simply cannot be tapped into if I try to give some some cookie cutter strategy so that's why in AI Lim I've distilled all of my learnings from seeing hundreds of students success and equipped AI Lim with a set of strategies that it will build around you and personalize to you based off your background at the start of the AI Liam experience you will go through a 10 to 15 minute onboarding process where AI Lim will learn about your current situation on things like your experience your connections your current skills even your current commitments as well like your job or your family only then will you be taken into the step-by-step strategy section that provides you with the resources you need to do things like upskilling and learn more things about the space build your skills before you start your business and after analyzing carefully which skills you're deficient in of course will recommend you the exact resources you need to watch to fill out those deficiencies before you move forward you'll then be given Crystal Clear instructions every step of the way and once you complete the step you can check back in with Alm and you'll be given the next step in your personalized strategy the only difference between the free and the paid versions is the resources provided of course my accelerator members will get all of the premium resources included with an accelerator membership at every step of the way while the free members will get excellent free resources that I've trated these from all over the Internet and also from my own free resources that I've made available so I hope you guys don't get too mad at me for tricking you but I did say I'll give you a step-by-step strategy at the end but this way no matter when you watch this video 6 months or a year from now you know that you'll be getting the latest and best strategy for you to maximize your chances of success that is the core idea that we're going for here we will be constantly updating that program and the steps that you can takeen through so that you can get the best strategy for you that's the whole idea here that we can

solution Concepts that are in high demand that you can start selling in 2024 everyone knows that the AI space is a gold mine of opportunities this here yet many are left on the sidelines feeling unsure on how to get in on the action the biggest hurdle for beginners knowing what to sell thanks to this YouTube channel my AI agency morning side AI gets a ton of inbound leads and in this video I want to dig into this data and share with you all what AI Solutions businesses are ready to throw money at in 2024 better yet my Discord and YouTube communities are packed with other agency owners who have found their own profitable AI Solutions and today I'll be sharing three success stories from the community revealing their exact solution and how they're making money with it I'm trying to pack a ton of value into this video for you guys so we're going to be kicking off with the three Community ideas before jumping into my ideas that I've got from my own agency's inbox starting off with the beginner friendly ideas and then ramping up to the more advanced but way more profitable Solutions there'll be time stamps along the bottom if you want to jump around to anything in particular but stay tuned to the end because I have put a bonus idea that I think is going to explode that no one's really talking about right now of course if you're new here and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I run my own AI development company called morning side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world I teach people how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the ideas that I'm about to share with you before we jump into the video I just want to ask you guys if you want to follow my Instagram it'll be linked down below @ Liam Motley I've decided to share a lot more of my behind the scenes of my life running my AI businesses and the travel that I'm doing I'm here in Austria right now I'm doing all sorts of cool stuff really letting you see behind the curtain on who I am and what I get up to so if you're not already following my Instagram posting a real every day over there sharing my life so you can follow that down below or just @ leam mly now let's dive in I want to start off with these Community Solutions first as you guys love to stop watching videos halfway through so in order for me to shine the most light on these guys as possible I'm putting them at the start I'd really appreciate if you guys could go and show some love on the platform that they provided as these people are essentially sharing their winning products to use like an e-commerce example which they definitely don't have to do so if you want to give some value back and and show some love back to the guys who are sharing this for the community please follow their platforms engage with the YouTubes twitters whatever it is and to be clear these are not just ideas these are use cases that these agency owners are making money with I put out a form to my Discord and my Telegram and these were the ones that I like the most that were actually making money and successfully selling them number one is voice enabled AI sales Bots this is from a Community member called Sam Yar from AI answers. us so Seine has been helping local businesses like Tradesman to automate their customer inquiries via phone lines with AI I'll need to have a chat about the exact setup that he's using but from the video on his website he's allowing 247 bookings for HVAC companies saving business owners time spent on the line and increasing bookings by apparently 20% at 100% of the inbound calls to this company are actually being answered and a booking attempt is being made by the AI essentially he set up an AI to automatically answer and respond to all calls coming in no matter what time of day and it could always be like 100% answer rate which is awesome I love this use case and he's following my recommended strategy of niching down to one solution or one Niche and has made $35,000 in 3 months so of course a massive congrats to samine he also has a YouTube channel so if you want to go and show some love there he's got some tutorials breaking down what he's doing he's also got his website all going to be linked down there and of course if you're a business who's interested in these kind of services you can contact me down below there'll be a link to his business as well number two is an e-commerce product recommendation system this is by a Community member called Brendan from inflate AI this one was really great to see for me because this is actually something that I first mentioned this concept of an e-commerce product recommendation system in one of these prior videos so like the same kind of format I'm doing here I think it was two either one ago or the one before so Brandon has G and taken that idea and run with it and built out an excellent voice flow prototype not even a prototype a fully fledged system that actually works really well essentially customers can come on and say hey I'm looking for this and then it will automatically recommend them and pop up a nice couple Carousel cards even in the chat bot so includes image includes a link to purchase and check out the the product page really cool idea and executed very well from what I can tell from the tutorial on his YouTube channel so if you want to go and check out Brendan's tutorials he's got a YouTube channel you can go check that out down below as well I'll leave a link so you guys can learn how to make your own e-commerce product recommendation system this one because this is definitely the direction that e-commerce is heading at the moment and Brendon here has put in the hard work to create the system and has reaped the benefits generating $7,000 Australian dollars from just four clients and it's attracted Some solid attention on YouTube by sharing this build as well if you're an e-commerce store owner and you would like one of these built out you can contact Brandon down below be a to book and a call and get this thing built out for you I really like what Brandon is doing here because again he's following my recommended strategy of creating a niche solution and in this case he's marketing it via YouTube videos as I have done with my agency to a specific audience so he's including e-commerce product da da like he's he's making a YouTube video that he knows the kind of people that he can serve are going to be clicking on and interested in watching so very good work Brandon that's awesome stuff thirdly we have an invoice cleaning system for Tradesmen this is by Our Community member Conor Davis from outbox Solutions so this is actually another Australian guy crushing it Conor has created a cleaning system that uses GPT to not only spell check but format and punctuate invoice descriptions for Tradesmen before they sent to the customers so not known for their literary flare Tradesmen typically aren't great at describing the work that's been done and what the system essentially does is ensures Clarity and professionalism for the plumbing franchises that corner is working with across their 14 franchise locations now you may not think spell check and formatting is very valuable but the key thing here is that this tool is used 100 times a day across all of the locations that they have which is exactly what I was talking about over on my Twitter but you're not already following I share a lot of my thoughts and my like solution ideas over there so it's going to be linked here and Link down below if if you're not already foll me on Twitter to get this stuff first but essentially what I'm talking about over there is that volume equals value in this case we have a very basic thing which is essentially spell check and formatting but because it has been done thousands of times per month it provides a lot of value to the business and that's really where AI in these Solutions can shine is when you have a lot of volume going through a system even if it's basic it can be Super Value due to the amount of volume going through it and from this one client Conor is pulling in $1,176 per month and from that he's subtracting about $200 in usage cost cost for the apis now there's actually a fairly straightforward way that he can reduce this by like 90 95% I'd love to do it in a video so if you want to know how you can reduce these costs I can make a whole video on it so let me know down in the comment section below so if you guys want you can go and connect with Connor on LinkedIn where he's actually sharing some AI source and value on his LinkedIn so the link will be down in the description and of course if you're a business owner who could benefit from some kind of solution like this you can get in touch with Conor by going down to the description there'll be a link to his agency and you can get in touch and start working with them seeing these guys from the community get out out there and make moves like this nearly brings a a bloody tear to my eye you know it's it was hard in 2023 for many of you I know I know that it was hard for us at times as well but starting these AI agencies is is just hard because we're early the tech itself is unreliable and hard to use at best and customers really expect something that is out of our capabilities in many in many ways and in general they're skeptical of allowing AI into their business we're definitely fighting an uph battle at this point but at some point it will get easier and this Market will really mature and develop and at that point we'll all be in the perfect place to benefit from it I'm so grateful to these guys for being open about their success and I hope that I can bring them all the business and and attention that they deserve through this mention in my video so if you're another agency owner and you would like to be featured in my next video like this there will be a form down in the description I'd love to be able to shine more light on not only the AI use cases that are converting and making money but also being able to jump start the personal Brands and and even the agencies and bring some clients to you guys through my audience of these hardworking agency owners like you this stuff is hard because we are literally Paving the way for future agency owners to follow and there's no handbook on what to sell or how to sell it we just have to figure it out and unlike other business models which have clearly defined strategies and and offers like smma and and Drop Shipping but us Mad Dogs Out Here are are really throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks and so to those of you continuing to grind this journey out with me I salute you and wish you the best for 2024 okay so jumping into time of my morning Side based lead ideas we're starting off with some simple GPT based solutions for businesses if at any point you don't understand what I'm talking about here like tools or custom actions or knowledge bases Etc you need to go and watch my complete guide to gpts which I'll link up here that teaches you everything you need to know about making money with gpts over an hour long and it's essential for anyone looking to make money in the AI Space by selling these gpts and AI agents this year GPT idea number one is AI personas for creators if you've been watching my channel for a while you'll know what an AI Persona is but essentially it's if I want to create an AI Persona of myself I would take all of my YouTube videos and some of my course material and stuff like that I would stuff it into a knowledge base and make an AI version of myself I'd prompt the system to be Liam otley and you respond this way and you do this this this so making an AI version of someone and I've cover this on the channel elsewhere I'll put a link to this up here if you want to watch my AI Persona guide it might be a little bit outdated now I should probably do a new one but I think that soon all creators will have their own GPT or their own AI Persona as a GPT which is kind of publicly available AI that allows them to connect with their fans and at any time to really tap into their knowledge the reason I think that creators are going to adopt the stuff is because they can put their affiliate links and their links to programs and any kind of monetization that creators do already on their Channel they can make that available through the GPT so put all your knowledge in you allow people to interact with it then you can create different tools that allow users to do cool things with the creators thing like I don't know generate some kind of script I could feasibly see creators offering maybe a 20% Revenue shift for any conversions that come through the GPT for the person or the agency managing it you'd be kind of required to update and create the knowledge base as they upload more information and sort of release new programs and stuff like this you'd also be on the chain for rigorously testing it to make sure it's not doing anything it's not supposed to and you'd also be in charge of creating custom tools that allow the AI to do cool things and increase usage increase retention of people that are actually engaging with it if anyone wants to test this idea I'm sure you can make a GPT out of me and send it to me on Instagram or whatever platform you want and then the second use case for gpts I see is kind of like a subcategory of streamlining AI workflows for companies this is kind of based on the fact that gpts are a great way to standardize the use of chat GPT across an organization so right now lots of small to mediumsized businesses are already using chat GPT in a number of ways for their copywriting or for analyzing CVS or all these different kind of use cases that you'd use or you'd be familiar with companies are using this but they're interacting with the regular chat gbt interface they're passing around massive prompts between the company they got like prompt Banks and stuff like this what gpts allow you to do is to really consolidate that and standardize the experience and make tools and and specific GPT experiences to do these things without having to make it kind of a pass the prompt around game this is essentially using chat GPT for the interface of the AI agent you create which is super handy because you don't have to build a fancy interface or front end and it's really a lowcost way for you to be able to provide value for these businesses personally I wouldn't be charging more than maybe a couple hundred bucks to set up the following gpts for businesses but they're pretty good starting point for beginners you can either create a GPT by function EG maybe a product description assistant or generator or you can create a role based GPT that helps a specific type of person and the company IG in online store manager where you bundle a whole bunch of tools that you create like the product description generator into one GPT and they can kind of use this tool as their Hub and their base of of doing their job basically so give me a product description for this paste in the thing and you have all these different tools that that particular role can use first GPT idea in the subcategory is a company documentation assistant now I have touched on this before on the channel I think in a previous video like this essentially get a sop or standard operating procedures documentation Che cap P this is a fairly straightforward thing to do but can provide a lot of value to the business by standardizing access to all of the information and the documentation and how to do the rle so all you need to do is is get the documentation or the standard operating procedure do the Sops and get up those documents put it into a GPT knowledge base and then send that off to your client and allow them to use that and pass it around to the different departments maybe you make a couple different gpts for different roles so they get access to different documentation you get the idea another idea for gpts for companies like this would be an AI personal assistant so you can identify some of the key tasks that the entrepreneur running the business or the executives running the business do often and create a tool and add that to your GPT and allow them to come in again and have this kind of work Hubble or workstation where they can do key functions of their job just from the GPT or chat GPT interface so they can come on and say can you please check all the slack channels and see if there's anything that I need to do or can you please go on and notify about this this this another really great idea for a GPT is a Content creation or repurposing assistant so this will be a GPT that helps you to generate Maybe short form scripts or tweets or YouTube Community posts Etc in order to do this you need to create tools on relevance Ai and again I haven't done my complete gu and relevance AI have done a partial guide for GPT tooling with relevance it's basically a low code no code Builder that allows you to create really powerful tools without needing to know too much and super easy connection between relevance and creating it and adding it to your tool I do have a complete guide to relevance AI tooling on the way so if you want me to rush that out let me know in the comments below essentially what you do for this GPT is to create a tool that generates a tweet thread and a tool that generates a short form script and a tweet that helps generate a section for a newsletter so for myself I'd probably want to be taking a link to one of my YouTube videos say I could take this YouTube video put it into my GPT and say hey can you generate a a tweet thread out of this can you generate a newsletter section and can you generate a couple different short form scripts so I paste that link in that would use it on each of these different tools and these tools on relevance AI I would have given it a couple of examples of my prior tweet threads or my prior short form scripts that I converted well and then what the tool would do is it take the link from that video get the transcript of it would pass it through a set of llm steps that I've prompted to this use my past examples and it would output maybe three different tweet thread ideas so that's kind of thing I actually need to create it myself and I have been thinking of doing it so if you want me to give a step-by-step walk through on how you can create this kind of repurposing or content assistant that's a GPT I'm more than happy to do so just let me know in the comments this is needed by basically all creators and entrepreneurs right now so there is a huge demand for this kind of solution another idea would be a sales assistant this works if you have a sales department in a company and you have a bunch of sales reps you need to identify the repetitive task that these sales reps are doing over and over and over again in their in their sales process it might be I don't know enriching the leads and getting more information on them it might be pre-qualifying before calls it might be preparing call notes before you jump on the line and what you need to do is create a tool for each of these little functions and you can say hey can you give me some more information on this person you pass their name and the LinkedIn URL and it gives you back some more information or B it it can even interact with the CRM and you can say hey this is the person I'm about to call can you go into the CRM pull the LinkedIn URL enrich me get some call notes ready and Trigger all these functions and it can actually connect to the CRM and provide updates in real time essentially this could be a co-pilot for your sales department so when they're doing the job they've always got this open they can be making calls they can be doing things and they've got this GPT that really helps them to do a lot of the stuff super easy through natural language that's all we got for gpts but before we jump into the next section if you are enjoying the video you have got any value out of it please hit down below and leave a like on the video really helps myself and the channel and my team out to continue what we're doing in space and of course if you like this kind of content you want to make money with AI you want to build businesses and make a life you truly love living be sure to head down and subscribe to the channel a lot of you people who watch my videos aren't even subscribed so if you're not subscribed you can subscribe down there and you can be notified whenever I make new videos like [Music] this now we get into AI agents so gpts are one thing but creating AI agents that can be deployed to platforms and embedded into workflows within companies are an entirely different Market that you can address this year to be fully transparent this is where my focus is for the year as myself andentertainment mornings continue to build agentive my AI SAS platform into the world's leading platform for creating deploying and managing AI agents all of the following agent ideas can be made on agentive in just a few hours first we have a customer support agent now I know you're rolling your eyes customer support's dead no one wants to buy it but customer support is still a key part of a business that can be assisted or or completely automated by AI again this goes back to the concept of volume equaling value in this case many types of businesses receive high volume of customer support queries and being able to automate this system using an agent in this case that's more advanced than your typical AI customer support chat or even just a standard one what agents can do you can stuff it with a bunch of functions and tools that allow it to do key things like you can instead of it just being a a question and answer B that has a knowledge base you can have a refund tool that can start to process a refund and they provide their order number and the email and you're able to give them live updates on where their order is so adding in these kind of features maybe leaving a review these kind of functions and tools that really make your solution become an AI agent rather than just a boring AI chatbot is what's going to allow you to have the edge and be able to sell these things as here maybe customer support isn't the core of your offer because it's not as as exciting but on the flip side of that customer support may be more familiar and so it's easier sort of Trojan Horse to get into businesses and get your foot on the door so maybe making a really awesome customer support AI agent and then giving that away for next to nothing or even for free is a great way for you to get in the door businesses build a bit of trust then be able to upsell them on all of these different cool things that I've been talking about in this video next we have lead generation agents yes into the basics again lead generation is still a core function of the business that AI can be a massive help with when it comes to generating leads there's a lot of volume involved there's a lot of time human time wasted talking to people or or getting into conversations with people that are never going to be customers so if you can get that first touch and where people first interact with the company to be as automated as possible so that the humans can focus on the qualified leads then you're providing a lot of value to the business so how can you actually Implement a lead generation AI agent into a business if you've been watching my recent videos you'll know I did a solar lead gen AI agent that I deployed onto a website this was with a voice flow integration that allowed me to put a website widget down in the corner and this was able to both have a knowledge component and also a lead capture component and a cool tool for lead generation website widgets I'd recommend some kind of knowledge component so that customers can learn more about the business and the kind of things they sell or maybe the kind of area that the business is in then i' also try to include some kind of tool like a like a calculator as I did in the video that allows them to interact more and show a little bit more intent and then you can add in a lead capture tool that allows them to provide the information you can capture that lead after they've interacted with the tool That's my kind of current model on how I do AI agents that are lead generation website widgets and then secondly for lead generation agents I think there's a big opportunity for creating chat subdomains and I haven't talked about this yet this been something I've wanted to get out and talk about for a while but I haven't found an idea solution that I'm ready to share with you these AI agents are a little bit lame when they just confined to a little website widget down the bottom so taking them out onto a full page chat interface and let the chat gbt but for a company is a very interesting concept to me and something that I'm going to make a video on in the near future so if you have the skills right now putting them on their own kind of chat GPT page and allowing people to interact with it that way might be a little bit better as a lead generation system next we have outbound qualification agents these kind of systems are typically done via outbound SMS so when a lead is captured via your lead gen chatbot or any other kind of lead magnet that you have within the business or within your funnel you can then pass that phone number that you captured over to this outbound qualification assistant and you can use SMS to essentially get an agent to conversate with this person and say hey look I like how much money you making what where base like what what kind of things do you sell so do these qualification steps automatically via outbound SMS and you can follow up after that lead has been captured and then once you've confirmed that they are qualified you can then book them into a call and kind of transition to a bit of an appointment setter which we're going into next but taking this outbound SMS idea or outbound anything really to be able to qualify before getting on a call with people and making sure that they're a good fit for your products and services is another great use for AI agents this year right now this kind of thing is tricky to do but it is a great upsell if you're already offering lead generation Services then next of course we have an appointment setting AI agent this is still a great use case appointment setting is one of the most painful things to hire for nobody likes doing it either just a horrible job that humans shouldn't have to do anymore and this of course is's a massive Market on things like Instagram DMS where all sorts of coaches are trying to set appointments by their Instagram DMS and then finally for the AI agent section of this video we have ai personas again this time not the GPT form the actual Standalone AI agent version if you saw homi's recent Instagram post saying that he's partnering with skull he's saying that online communities are blowing up right now and basically every online community or coaching program can benefit from some kind of AI it is a central hub for information that everyone in the community can go to for Access as I mentioned before creating these AI personas of say someone like myself and my own paid Community or even free community you can take all of my information that I put out either public or private or paid information put it into a knowledge base and then make an AI assistant or AI agent in this case and add that to the community to provide more value and let people access that information and access key tools and functions as well maybe it might be hey my one might have a niche selection tool where you can have a conversation back and forth with me and I can help you generate some Niche ideas for your business so if you're going to be selling these AIS owners you can go to coaches or Community owners and offer them a free trial to test it out you can even enable with some functions and Cool Tools to extend its capabilities and I really think this whole area of creators coaches Community owners is going to blow up this year as hosi has said he's seen the data and this would be a very good and very wise place to be placing your bets as an AI agency owner this year next section of this video is what I like to call AI pipelines now sometimes you don't need a conversational input or or a conversational agent what you need is kind of a an AI function or a pipeline to be able to process data and do cool things to be able to do valuable processes for a business at times all businesses need is a a kind of function or a pipeline that you can throw some data at and say do the process with that or they might want an entire spreadsheet of data to be run through at once so it's like each row they want the same thing done to it so these are kind of AI pipelines is how I describe them I like these pipelines because they go into this area of these high volume tasks where AI can really shine and provide a lot of value to the business and as You' probably expect I recommend relevance AI for creating these kind of pipelines this is not a page sponsor video I just really like what they're doing for the kind of stuff that we are trying to create in 2024 and Beyond so if you're not already signed up I highly recommend you check it out I do have some videos coming on them complete guide the building tools which is coming very soon so if you're not already subscribed have subscribe for that because that's going to make you very dangerous and Powerful as a business owner as a freelancer in 2024 relevant AI is my goto for these kind of pipelines thought because they make it very easy to create it with like a no code no code function Creator you're essentially just creating a big function and creating it block by block but you can also take that exact same tool and not just run it once you can run it in bult and you can do an entire spreadsheet of data and do the same thing on like a thousand rows of data which is very powerful doing this bul run feature first AI pipeline idea is again lead generation this is a big thing that AI can really help with but again high volume equals high value and one of AI strength is rapidly analyzing data so if you pick an and you can find a way to generate leads for them either in bulk or on a consistent basis using an AI tool or setup built on something like relevance then you have a way of generating and selling leads to businesses that need them this one came to mind because over at morning side we had a client who came to us and their business was basically uh generating leads by pulling annual reports I think it was in Germany and they would pull annual reports from where all of them were stored for that particular country and they need to manually go on there download the report for each company and see if they had any particular I won't mention what it is but they were looking for one particular type of activity that these companies were doing and that will qualify them for being a potential customer of theirs so they're doing this manually now we're building them A system that can strip the entire company's register and get all of them and analyze them in batch once a year and that's going to save them so much time and so we're being able to charge quite a lot of money so this kind of using AI to do high volume lead generation tasks and these kind of pipeline processes I think it's a really big opportunity if you can be smart about it and find a way of generating leads that not many people are thinking about or you can go to a business and and identify that they're doing it a slow way and improve it like we are next we have pre-qualification and call notes this is similar to what I touched on earlier in the video for the GPT sales assistant essentially if a business has a sales team that is given these lead lists for them to dial and contact you can drastically improve the efficiency of the department by using some kind of AI pipeline to do research on the leads and attempt to pre-qualify them to ensure that no time is wasted by calling dud leads that are never going to be your client right what this pipeline can do is generate a summary of the leads info ahead of the call and this can massively speed up the process with the sales people not only will this pipeline be able to pre-qualify them before the call so maybe it has the website link their LinkedIn profile and you're able to pull the information scrape it use AI in a pipeline to analyze that and determine if it meets a certain criteria then that's pre-qualified and then what you can even do is inside that tool is get it to create okay based off the company information on the website and the LinkedIn profile of the founder or the person you're going to speak to here's some handy call notes and maybe a a couple lines to use in the intro of the call from the limited amount of call calling that I've done it was always helpful for me to be able to have some kind of information or background and these notes that would help me to be sort of more prepared when I get on the call and that they're not just some stranger that I know nothing about so all these kind of things can massively speed up the process for the salese and help generate more sales for the company NeXT we have quite an easy one that you can build on something like make.com which is just an email autoresponder so as soon as the email hits the inbox you can use an AI task to classify it into something that the AI can respond to or something that needs to be passed on then you can generate some kind of AI response based off a knowledge base and you can send that email back so super easy one you can set up not too complicated but if people don't want to move over to a chat boot setting up an AI based autor responder that can classify and respond to 80 90% of the queries is a good thing to set up for businesses as well and the final pipeline idea for you is a CV evaluation pipeline now this is kind of close to home for me and the guys at morning side because we've able to be searching over hundreds and hundreds I think it's up to thousands of CVS now and and go over applications for different roles we be hiring for this process takes so long we put up a LinkedIn jobs post for I think it was a full stack developer or an A another AI developer we got a thousand applicants then my business partner Josh and my CTO Spencer had to go through all of these different applications and try to whittle down to some people that we actually could hire and I think they went through a thousand of them and got to the end and there wasn't one that they wanted to get in a call with so one thing is shortlisting another is actually getting on these calls so even though we are an AI development company we don't have time to build this kind of stuff for ourselves if someone came to us and said hey I have a system that will allow you to hire super easily you can just throw in a massive spreadsheet full of data and it's going to be able to go against a criteria that you provide maybe a prompt it and say we're looking for someone with this kind of experience in this assist need to be based on this assist and have these kind of skills and I can pass that prompt into the system and it's going to be able to go through and short list at least get down to a short list that we can get on calls with this kind of thing again is volume based if there's a lot of volume involved in the task you can use AI to really shine because it can do things without complaining and and do things very quickly so I love this kind of CV thing anything related to hiring I think there's a lot of value here I really think there's a great use case here and it can provide a lot of value to businesses finally getting into the last section of this video we going over outbound AI calling systems you may have noticed that this is similar to what sine earlier in this video was doing but his is on inbound call so he's setting it up on a number and waiting for calls to come in in this case I'm talking about outbound calls and using AI calling systems to get in front of customers to initiate those calls and to do things on an outbound basis rather than waiting for them to come to you to put a disclaimer that these kind of systems are very new but they do offer huge potential if they can be implemented right and I think it's really one of those use cases that's just going to explode over the next couple of years and we can be the first ones there and really be facilitating the adoption of it if you know what you're doing I'm not entirely sure that the technology is there to be able to deal with every use case imaginable but for the use cases that are really high volume I do think that this could be highly valuable to businesses in many ways so I've got a couple different use cases that you can use this outbound AI calling for this is primarily based around Bland AI which is a company that's doing some really really awesome stuff I think they've got their response time down to 400 milliseconds or something so like sub half a second response time so you're on the phone you say something it's less than half a second by the time it's generated the response generated The Voice and then sent it back to you so very impressive stuff what the Bland team is doing over there jumped in the Discord so I'm going to be exploring some of the solution a little bit more if you want me to expand on any of the ones that I'm talking about here let me know in the comments and I'd love to do a full buildout and show you guys how to actually set it up because not only on this channel do I give you the ideas and share you share this data with you but I also can build these things for you and give you guys the templates you need to start selling it yourself and I will add that not only can these Bland systems do SUB half second response times they also have tool usage meaning you can trigger a function and you can capture lead or you can update their form or or or book an appointment or all these kind of things you can do tool usage from these AI phone calls which I think is just like insane at the moment so I'm really excited to share some of these ideas with you so first use case for these AI cold calling systems built with Bland AI is a cold calling or first Touch system this is really the most painful part of most businesses that everyone knows they should be doing call calling but no one does so creating and selling these systems will allow you to give businesses the ability to be able to make thousands of coold calls a day as long as you have the lead generation capability ities to back that up you can be making tons and tons of calls per day and if you're setting up things like okay let's let's take a look at what are the highest performing scripts let's be optimizing this over time you can get to a point where eventually you have a cold CL script that this AI goes for that is converting at a a very decent rate considering you're able to do this with basically Pennies on the dollar and send them out on mass without ever having to pick up a phone I love this use case I'm not sure how effective it is right now but I'm sure people are going to be able to figure it out and this thing brings more business in for businesses it brings sales in it's directly correlated to adding more money to the top and bottom line so love these use cases I think this is going to be a real big one for this year Second Use case for this could be customer support so you can do some outbound customer support things where someone might send an email in and they might be complaining about something then you can send an outbound customer support call to them and say hey we'll get in touch with you shortly and figure this out you can send an outbound customer support call to them and give customer support to people who may not want to be typing around on a computer maybe you have an old demographic and a a phone call is better than them just typing away so this kind of outbound customer support could be a cool use case as well another handy one could be for surveys and follow-ups you can reach out to people who are past users of your service and say hey how did we do can you leave us a review or a rating and do outbound surveys like that or you can do automated follow-ups in the same way where they reach out after they've provided their information you can follow up with them and say hey look by the way this so follow-ups handy survey is handy as well and finally of course lead qualification and appointment setting this of course would be a great one soon as their lead comes in instead of doing some sort of outbound SMS you can do outbound calling and get in touch with them and say hey how can I help you what kind of time works for you for a call do some qualification steps and you the tool users should be able to book in a call with that as well so not only can you do those outbound SMS like we talked about earlier using an agent you can use this outbound calling to do the same thing and I know some of you are looking at me and thinking this guy doesn't know what he's talking about no one would ever buy this BL La well samine the guy that I mentioned earlier in the video from our community he has made $35,000 doing the same kind of implementation as this only on an inbound basis so if he's been out to figure out how to make $35,000 in 3 months and there's definitely some kind of money here for other people doing it not only on the outbound basis but inbound as well and finally my bonus idea as promised this was initially discussed on my Twitter so you can follow that if you haven't already personally I'm very excited for the growth in this self-operated computer space so to me I think the next step in AI is for us to be able to prompt our computer or our browser and for tasks to automatically be completed for us in real time so for example I could go onto my browser and click a little Chrome extension or a little pop up in the corner and say can you please follow Sam Alman on Twitter and like his most recent tweet then the AI would take control of my browser and do the action requested so this stuff is literally already happening and there's a GitHub repo called self-operating computer that you can use a demo and you can tell it to operate your computer and tell it to open up like go on and browse Wikipedia so it will operate your computer so I personally see this as the next step and that AI is going to be able to do more advanced and complex functions by operating our browser in the short term there's really two two routes for these AI assistants to be able to do stuff for us and be real good AI assistants and be able to say hey can you find the find a restaurant and do this this this there's two routes one is going the self-operated computer route where we're using Vision models to control it like a computer and the other route is using apis and and having an agent that can basically call all these different apis and do things I personally think that the vision model side that the self-operating computer route is going to be done sooner and so we're going to start to see these pop up but eventually the API bomb will will be a thing so I think it's it's exciting that this year we may start to see these self-operating computers be able to be like leased out as AI employees so you could be an AI agency and you've put a couple different virtual machine set up with this self-operating computer software and system on it and then you can lease those systems and machines out to different businesses and they can say okay you have just hired two AI employees off us you can tell them what to do and so you can connect in the slack and you can be able to prompt it and say hey can you do this this and this and then that AI machine the virtual machine is going to be operated by Ai and do the task for the people people so it's like hiring and and a computer with no one sitting in front of it that's your AI employee this of course is just an idea but I do think the stuff is going to explode and it seems super cool to me this concept of of self-operating computers and even that rabbit thing that popped up is essentially using a a large action model to do exactly what I was talking about so it's definitely the route we're going it's going to be interesting to see how it develops this here and that's about all I've got for you in this video right now I hope that was enough I kind of put everything I could in here for you guys to get a good start on 2024 and you really use these things that we are seeing business want over at oneide Ai and also sharing these wins from the community we a to pull this together for all of you to be able to take these there's a massive Market there's enough room for all of us to share people always ask me oh Liam why would you make YouTube videos when just make more competitors for yourself there is no way on Earth that I could possibly try to take even 1% of the market that we have here it'll be ridiculous for me to try and gatekeep this entire thing so it's we web saying thank you to complain about me sharing it but I couldn't possibly even take just one Niche to myself so go for it I'd love more people in here I like making new friends that are AI agen owners as well we've got a great Community both free and paid I've made some great friends out of it so I really want to just build this community and I'd love to see the progress we're all making together going into 2024 so if you want to stay in the loop on the latest AI solution ideas like these ones I've shared that you can sell this year and Beyond be sure to subscribe to the channel as I make these kind of videos fairly often and I'm going to continue to allow community members to come and share show a bit of light on them so if you don't want to miss the next one where I give away validated AI solution ideas make sure you hit down below and subscribe to the Channel please leave a like on the video it really helps me and supports me in creating more of this kind of stuff and leave a comment Down Below on which of these you think you'd like to see me build out in a future tutorial and maybe which ones you're most excited to build yourself I'd love to break some of these things down further for you in a future video and give you a template so that you can start selling them yourself if you're interested in learning how to build gpts and take your first steps into AI agent creation as a beginner I have a complete 1 hour and 20 guide for you right here but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "open AI has just released the GPT store marking the App Store moment for AI looking back to 2008 when Apple Unleashed their App Store only those with app development skills got a slice of the millions the App Store generated the difference for us today is that the skills required to create for the GPT store and start making money can be learned in an hour or two rather than 3 years of software engineering at College that's why today I'm going to be teaching you absolutely everything that I know about building gpts and making money from them as a beginner so that you can take advantage of the Easy Money new platforms like this offer before it's too late however since there's going to be tens of thousands of people rushing to this new opportunity the challenge is not knowing how to create gpts but how to create actually valuable gpts that will stand out from the competition and generate you passive income for years to come teaching you the skills required to do so is the goal of this video now before you sit down and listen to another random guy on the internet teach you how to make money online if you want to be a millionaire next month this is the way to do it you need to know a little bit about the person giving you the advice if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI agency morning side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the gpts you're about to build I'm originally from New Zealand but now live in Dubai and I've been doing online business for the past 5 years over the past 12 months I've sold nearly half a million dollars worth of AI chat Bots to my clients and I've taught the people in my free and paid Community how to sell tens of thousands of dollars worth of their own the reason I'm making this video today is that within my own agency we are starting to see a massive shift in demand away from the normal AI chat Bots we're used to building towards AI agents like gpts that are equipped with tools and knowledge the change in demand has been so significant that we have pivoted almost all of our resources to going all in on this opportunity at I specialized in AI agent creation the majority of which is done through my AI agent platform agentive now I hate to ramble on about myself but when I was starting out an online business all those years ago I wasted my time listening to people who weren't qualified to give the advice they gave so I've been in your position before and I don't want you to go through what I did so that's a little bit about me I hope you think I'm qualified to be giving the information I'm about to share as you can probably tell by the length of this video I'm not holding any secrets back from you I've structured this video into three different chapters starting right from the basics of what is a GPT all the way up to the advanced deployment techniques that I've found to make money with GPT but feel free to skip around using the time stamps along the bottom so you can start wherever your skill level is chapter one is foundation in order to make money with gpts you need to properly understand gpts and the opportunities they present this chapter covers the basics for beginners right up to the dangers and pitfalls of becoming H gbt creator that no one's talking about right now chapter two is skills in this chapter I break down each of the five different skills you need to know to be able to crush as a no code GPT developer and to be able to make passive income from from the GPT store and some of the skills you need you definitely wouldn't expect and finally chapter three is creation in this Final Chapter I walk you through creating your first GPT that incorporates all of the available features on the GPT platform and I'll also show you how to jailbreak that same GPT and use it elsewhere on places like websites WhatsApp and More in order to get the most out of this video I want you to close out of all of your tabs save this video to your watch later and give yourself the next 2 to 3 hours to study the information in this video I want you to go and get a note book and a pen because there is far too much information in this video to soak it all in on your first run through and if you've done all that we are ready to get started Chapter One Foundation what are gpts for those complete beginners here we're going to be starting from the basics first things first we need to identify what is a GPT well gpts are best described as custom versions of chat GPT essentially they are customized versions of chat GPT that have been modified to be better at a specific task or more helpful to a certain type of person for example some of the most popular gpts to date have been canvas GPT which allows you to create designs and Graphics from natural language secondly at grimoire which is the number one Community made GPT at the moment which makes you a 100x engineer allowing you to build websites and more with prompt gramming this particular GPT is so high ranked because it has been cleverly marketed by the owner which we'll be going into dep on later then we have things like designer GPT which is a community made GPT which generates and hosts websites for you in just one prompt each of these and the other Popular Community made gpts which I'll leave a link to the leaderboard down below if you want to check it out but each of these have been created by modifying the functionality of the base chat GPT to be better at a specific thing by using what I like to call the three ingredients of a GPT these three ingredients are prompting so you can give your GPT a detailed set of instructions to determine its behavior for example the response length or the response style or the gpt's goal or purpose can all be communicated via prompting the second ingredient is knowledge the GPT Builder allows you to add your own files like PDFs spreadsheets or other documents to allow your GPT to draw information from these documents when responding to user queries so essentially a chat GPT on your data which was a hugely popular concept last year and thirdly actions so actions are special functions that your GPT can perform outside of just writing a text response to the user you can use either open ai's existing capabilities like image generation with doy browsing with Bing or the code interpreter or you can create your own custom capabilities that do things like send emails or book restaurants and more actions can also be called tools or functions as you'll likely see later in this video different combinations of these three ingredients of prompting data or knowledge and actions can create any kind of modified chat gbt that you can imagine but it is important to note that only one of these ingredients is actually required when creating a GPT and that is prompting with knowledge and actions being optional however knowing how to effectively find and add the right kinds of knowledge and create custom actions for your gpts is how real value is created later in this video I will be walking you through how to learn these valuable skills step by step so that you can immediately create high value gpts and start making money with your skills in 2024 it's important to note that GPT is just a fancy name for an agent an artificial intelligence an agent is a computer program or a system that is designed to perceive its environment and make decisions and take actions to achieve a specific goal or set of goals basically agents are chat bots on steroids the chat Bots we're used to typically just reply with a often pre-written response or some basic AI generated output agents can do far more than just send a text reply they can interact with apis and and anything across the web which allows you to do some pretty cool stuff with them you could theoretically have an agent that would fire a nuke for you as long as you told at the location and provided the launch code that's kind of the the triggering of of actions that you can do with agents if this sounds confusing at all don't worry because later in this course I'll be walking you through creating your own GPT or agent from complete scratch and everything will start to click into place gpts are really open ai's way of introducing the world to AI agents but this is just the first step in a much larger plan to introduce autonomous agents to our world more on this later the App Store opportunity at the time of filming this open AI has just released the GPT store people are calling this the App Store moment for AI which if this is true we have possibly the biggest opportunity to create wealth of the next decade in front of us as regular people this is the equivalent of being one of the first people to create an iPhone app in 2008 and List It On the App Store now I know that is a big statement to make so please stick with me while I back it up I know how pain V is hearing every second YouTuber talking about the big next opportunity but give me a second and I will back it up if you're a smooth brand gen ZZ kid like me we missed the App Store opportunity in 2008 because we were too young and even if you were old enough in 2008 creating apps was only really possible for the privileged few who had learned how to code and were really in the right place at the the right time to jump on the mobile apps opportunity the point here is that historically when new platforms arise it is stupidly easy to make money because there was so much attention so much demand and yet limited Supply the entire market and ecosystem around the platform has not really found equilibrium or found balance point yet so there are countless opportunities to catch a little slice of the wealth flowing into the space from investors and sponsorships and new startups with big budgets that they need to spend somewhere we've seen this with new platforms time and time again firstly of course we have the world Wide Web where early players caught the doom boom and were able to get millions and millions of dollars in funding with with just a name that says do com in it and ended up exiting for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars Mark Cuban sold his company broadcast.com which is radio put on the internet for a billion dollars and it's it's nothing now secondly of course we have the Apple App Store for the people who are early to the App Store and were early Builders the money came fast in the first 12 months following the app store's launch a guy named Steve de created a puzzle game called trism which turned over $2 million another guy called Bill rapos launched an app development company called wait for it great apps and was making $100,000 per month within a few months of launching an app called ieam that took 7 days to build a free application in the App Store two out of five stars hell some guy even made an app called I am rich that cost $1,000 and did nothing and sold a copy in 24 hours thirdly Facebook and Google ad platforms anyone who was early to these advertising platforms had ridiculously low advertising costs and basically printed money with super basic ad creatives and landing pages now years later the rest of the world has caught on and now companies struggle to profitably spend money on paid traffic due to the rising cost in competition finally number four is Tik Tok the growth that the early creators on Tik Tok saw was insane and many of these guys and girls have gone on to become some of the biggest stars in the world think of people like Charlie dellio and Bryce Hall and Addison Ray all these kind of creators now that kind of short form content is fiercely competitive and a lot harder to get that kind of growth I'm sure you get the point but what I'm trying to say is that early typically equals easy or at least early equals greatly increased chance of getting lucky and seeing disproportionate success if you tried to go onto Facebook ads and Get Ridiculous returns now the chance of you getting disproportionate success is much lower than it was when it first started that's what I'm trying to say here so it's clear that if the GPT store does take off and become the App Store of AI there is a huge opportunity for us but how can we actually make money from the GPT store open AI has announced that there's going to be Revenue sharing for GPT creators however Sam Alman has said that we're going to pay people who build the most valuable and most used gpts a portion of our revenue does that mean that there's a minimum usage requirement for you start to get paid how much will the revenue share be Etc there's a lot of questions around that I actually don't want to say too much on the revenue side of things just yet because at the time of filming this they haven't released a store yet but by the time you watch this they will have released a store yet hopefully more information will have been revealed by then so I'm going to make a video following up on this talking about Revenue sharing Etc so make sure you subscribe to the channel down below so you don't miss that but honestly I'm not expecting too much here in terms of Revenue sharing and I think it may have been more of a marketing tactic to get everyone hyped about building on the platform but I would love to be proved raw so if the payments from open AI are lackl what options do we have to make solid income from this gpts and agents book well I'm glad you asked the truth is the GPT store is only one part of a much larger picture sure creating valuable gpts and getting tons of usage that will earn you a few thousand a month is great but honestly I don't know if that will be possible for the majority of us the reality is that those with the audiences and the means to effectively Market their Creation in the gpts will have a massive Edge over your average GPT creator for example if I made a GPT for AI agency owners I could pump it up and its ranking on the store by making videos about it not all of you watching this can do the same all is not lost though as I said gpts are just a small part of a much larger picture AI agent building is the most valuable skill of 2024 so we've established that gpts are just a fancy word for AI agents right or AI assistants or whatever you want to call them basically AI chat Bots with a unique mix of prompting knowledge and actions the three ingredients that means that if you learn how to create GPT you're technically learning how to create AI agents no correct well the good news is that knowing how to create AI agents is going to be one of the most valuable skills and future proof skills that you can have in 2024 and Beyond not just for your personal use and productivity but for making money online as I'm about to explain the AI agent landscape is expanding rapidly and is set to be one of the most if not the most world changing fields of technology in the next decade a world where AI agents can speak to customers handle complex tasks and and join companies as part of their AI Workforce is really where all of this is heading but don't take it from me take it from all of the biggest Ai and tech companies in the world which have made it clear that AI assistance with custom actions AKA tooling is where they are placing their bets one of open ai's biggest competitors anthropic has recently announced that their model Claude will have API tool usage AKA actions and its 2.1 version Google has just released Gemini the multimodal GPT 4 killer which will undoubtedly support custom actions and agent Creation in the near future it looks like a bird to me even Amazon is expected to add agent creation and hosting services to its existing Cloud offering as well across all these different companies rushing to the same opportunity the same skill set will allow you to build agents I'm going to be explaining each of the five key skills needed to build agents and the steps you can take to master them in the next chapter of this course before taking you through creating your first GPT an AI assistant step by step at the end of this video what I want you to walk away from this video with is not only the perspective to see this opportunity for what it really is but also the knowledge you need to take your first steps into AI agent creation even as someone who doesn't know how to code but we're still stuck at the same question if we learn AI agent or GPT creation how can we make money from the skill if you devote the next 2 to 3 months to become a killer agent or GPT developer how can you monetize these abilities well who needs agents basically every business on the planet sooner or later this happens every time with new technology like the web and mobile apps when it first takes off there's a massive need for people who know how to build the technology for businesses so that they can adopt the technology and benefit from the Gams for example web development agencies popped up to make money by facilitating the adoption of websites by businesses which website seems quite crazy and stupid at first now everyone has one then mobile app development agencies popped up to make money by facilitating the adoption of mobile apps by businesses and now with this magical new AI technology is a massive need for agencies or Freelancers who know how to identify valuable use cases for agents and Implement them into businesses this is the opportunity that I realized last year and created the AI automation agency model which has since exploded into an online business opportunity and I've helped thousands to build their own AI agency like mine and both my free and paid communities but I didn't take this long just to give you a sales pitch I only bring this up because the successive both myself and of the hundreds of successful AI agency owners in my community it really proves that there is something here and a way to make money by selling these things to businesses if I do my job right with this video you should be able to get started and make money without ever paying me a dime at least that's the goal of the video this opportunity to sell AI agents to businesses or anyone who needs them really is the big picture of the GPT store release for example local businesses can use the AI agents that you can create in a few hours to automate their customer support or lead qualification digital businesses like agencies can use your AI agents to automate their researching and contacting of prospects solopreneurs can use your AI agents to supercharge the abilities with content automation or mass Outreach tools the list goes on for these kinds of use cases you need to break your GPT out of the chat gbt site and put them on websites and install them in existing systems this is easier than you think and I'll show you how to do this in the final chapter of this video my point here is that the AI agent Market is going to be massive and full of opportunity and personally I think it is one of the biggest opportuni of 2024 and Beyond mainly because it is so accessible to people to learn the skills needed to build this crazy powerful software people could only dream of a few years ago a lot of side hustles and make money online grifts are are borderline scamming and what I love about this is that you're actually building a hugely valuable skill set and implementing technology that will truly make a difference for your clients building AI agents presents you with an opportunity to charge deep into one of the most exciting fields in the world over the coming years and not only make money from anywhere but also open up doors to much bigger opportunities along the way market dynamics while I did say that the GPT store is only a small part of the picture I still want to give you the information you need to give in a good crack as I said if I teach you how to create killer gpts that same skill set can be transferred over to selling agents to businesses so it's a win-win with the GPT store launching I want to touch on the market dynamics that we'll likely see play out and being aware of this will ensure your strategy is better than most giving you a better chance of success whenever new platforms like the GPT store start there's usually a few different phases initially the market will be flooded with basic gpts that take off and a good for a specific use case but don't really have much to them maybe a couple PDFs and some decent prompting and these documents are likely publicly available and anyone can find them and recreate that same GPT for themselves but as these low barrier to entry GPT use cases flood the market they'll quickly become commoditized and lose all value if you make a GPT that 10,000 others can create in 20 minutes by by downloading the same ebook as you you're never going to get the usage numbers required to make any decent money on the platform because there might be a 100 different GPD creators who will given me the exact same thing and therefore all of the usage for that kind of use case is going to be split between all of the people but rather than you getting all of the usage it's going to be split between all of the other copies of the same GPT and you're not going to be making any decent money then the next phase will begin where Builders will need to get more creative and find other ways to create both unique and valuable gpts that will attract and retain users over a long period and creating this kind of value and long-term usage comes back to the three ingredients concept we discussed earlier we have prompting we have knowledge and we have actions to have any kind of long-term or consistent income from your gpts you'll need to be able to create unique value through one or more of these there are a number of different ways that you can create unique gpts so you might want to get your book out and and write these ones down firstly you can use expert or unique prompting which is fairly easy to replicate if someone else can come up with the same or similar prompt they can create the same kind of functionality you can but that is one way you can create some kind of point of difference with your gpts secondly you can use private or hardto find data as custom knowledge as you'll learn later in this video you can either kind of buy or scrape data off the internet and make your own custom knowledge base that very few can replicate because if you can get knowledge or information that people can't then people aren't going to be able to replicate what you've created with your GPT thirdly you can curate an interesting or unique mix of data in your GPT this is a pretty interesting one to me but the idea of you being a bit of an artist or a chef and and and putting the right types of data together whether it's publicly available or private or hard to find just baking an interesting mix that is hard to replicate and that provides a unique type of value that others can't provide and finally number four is of course creating unique or powerful actions and tools and functions that your GPT has that other people can't easily or or can never replicate for example if your uncle runs a roofing company and has dozens of high performing sales scripts that have been crafted over two decades to be really high performing you can take those and put those into a GPT as a custom knowledge base and call it a Roofing sales script expert by doing that you'd have created something that is difficult to copy and better yet you can throw in a roofing cost calculator tool that you created on relevance AI to increase its value even further in the next chapter of this video I'll be going into more depth on tooling relevance AI so stay tuned for that my point here is that it is much better to spend your time creating gpts that have some kind of unique value to them that is hard to replicate otherwise someone else is going to make the same thing and you'll have to split your Revenue if any with them be smart about where you spend your time and don't get caught up on dumb projects that will never make you a dime to make gpts that are actually unique and useful you need to master the three ingredients and become a GPT shf however there are two other skills you need to hit it big on the GPT store chapter two skills in this chapter of this free course we are going to be covering the five key skills that you need to succeed as a GPT Creator on the store and as an AI agent Creator working as a freelancer or an agency selling to businesses skill number one market research and use case identification it's pretty hard to make a GPT that thousands of people use every day and racks up some juicy Revenue sharing income for if you don't know what people want therefore market research and identifying a high value use case for your gpts is the first skill that you need to develop when doing research and coming up with your ideas that always needs to be through the lens of the three ingredients you need to be thinking how can I combine prompting knowledge and custom actions together in a way that creates something both useful to a specific user and unique and hard to replicate for example as I've done earlier on this channel you might make a gold investing assistant for the prompting ingredient you would tell the GPT that it's supposed to help with investing in gold using some of the knowledge based documents provided and the actions that you've given to it the knowledge ingredient of this GPT could be some PDFs on gold ADV Bing that you downloaded from the internet and jammed into the knowledge base and finally the action ingredient could be a gold price checker tool that you use an API to cetch the current price of gold and you make that available the reason I'm using this example is cuz I've made it in an early a video on my channel I'll link that L that up here if you want to watch that that's a very basic example and probably not the best one if you're looking to make money another example that my Twitter first heard about is a quotation assistant for framing businesses so I had a conversation with my auntie who owns a framing business in Oakland and she said that like the quotation process for us is an absolute nightmare um we have to go back and forth with them asking for like the size and the shape and the style that they want it's much easier if you able to create a GPT or an assistant that can collect the information from the user send it off to a calculator tool give them the price back send a payment link Etc so for the prompting ingredient of this GPT you'd say you are a framing business assistant who helps customers to get a quote for the knowledge component we don't need to use anything here and for the actions we' connect two tools firstly a generate quote which sends off to a quote calculator and Returns the price and then another tool that allows us to generate a unique payment link based of that quote price tender to the user and capture the payment so if you're looking to come up with a few ideas there's a few different ways you can do it firstly using your own experience in my opinion and my experience this is always the best option because if you know something about a specific industry say you've worked in as a content creator before or you've worked as a editor or something you know more about that issue and the kind of problems that they face and the kind of solutions they would need than anyone does so if possible think back through your past experience or what you even do right now think what kind of gpts could I create to solve the problems that I'm familiar with secondly you can hijack the experience of others so as I just mentioned with my auntie when I was having a conversation with her she told me hey this particular part about our business sucks and I was like okay that's an opportunity for creating some kind of AI system so if you can you have friends family anyone you can find who has specific information or understanding of some kind of area or Niche or industry they might be able to give you some insights on what kind of problems need to be solved and what can be solved with the GPT solution and finally you can do your own research on the internet you can use sites like Reddit and YouTube to research about a specific Niche or about a a specific type of user and try to figure out what their problems are and how you could solve those with a GPT solution one great platform for this that I have no affiliation with is called gummy research it has AI features that basically allow you to pick and mix different subreddits and then get AI insights about the kind of problems and and things people are complaining about so I'll leave a link to Gummy Search down below again no affiliation to it I just think it's a great tool for any of you who are doing market research and I recommend this to the guys in my accelerator and free community as well once you've got a bunch of ideas for gpts that you can build we then get to the next phase skill number two data sourcing preparation and curation in many cases but not all as you saw with the uh framing system that I mentioned before that doesn't need knowledge most of your gbds and agents will likely need custom knowledge element to make them more useful and relevant for your users this means that knowing how to find valuable data prepare it for use in your agents for best performance and potentially mix different data together and create a unique experience there's a set of skills that you need to have I find it's helpful to split data into three different categories public hidden and private so you might want to write these down public data is anything that you can find for free on the internet for example searching up gold investing PDF and adding any results find to my agent or to my GPT is an example of using public data of course since anyone with an internet connection can get to this data and replicate your gpts you likely face a lot of competitors using the exact same data who will end up siphoning off your earnings on the store hidden data is anything that requires a little bit of extra work to get your hands on examples of hidden data could include expensive or sort After books you have to buy or or find data scraped from the web and combined in a unique way or data collected yourself from things like surveys while all of this data is still accessible the hidden data like this requires some extra skills or resources or effort to create a valuable knowledge component for your GPT so a little bit of extra effort can go a long way to find this kind of data and finally private data is any proprietary data that is pretty much impossible for regular people to get access to this will often be data collected by companies on their customers sales or Trends Etc some of you may have this kind of data yourself or you may know someone who does you can offer to buy the data off them or to lease it off them and help them to monetize it by creating a GPT for them and share it with the world in that way this idea that people can monetize their private data through these AI agents in kind of a secure way is a very interesting concept to me identifying these hidden and interesting data sets will likely be the best option longterm to create value for most of you however to scrape and clean and sort large amounts of data can be difficult if you don't know how to code python is great for this and you can learn web scraping and data management in a couple of weeks if you're serious about things it's been hugely available for me in my own career over the past 12 to 24 months knowing at least the basics of python and JavaScript but it is a nice to have not a need to have to be successful skill number three prompt engineering the quality of your instructions to your GPT directly determines the quality of its outputs therefore knowing how to write good instructions or prompts is absolutely critical to your success the good news is is that it's not actually that hard there's a few key tricks that you need to learn that will put you in the top 1% of people prompting these models luckily for you I've already done a beginner's guide and an advanced guide on prompt engineering here on this channel that will teach you everything you need to know they'll both be linked below so make a note of it and you can come back and watch those later skill number four tool creation knowing how to create tools or custom actions that enable your GPT / agent to do things outside of the chat interface is key to creating something that is actually useful and valuable actions are one of the three ingredients of a GPT and as mentioned are often referred to as functions tools custom actions custom functions Etc they all mean the same thing if you're not too sharp on the devel V mment side of things they may be a little bit hard to wrap your head around but I'll try to break it down as simple as I can now in the most basic form tools are functions some functions expect an input others don't some return an output others don't but when triggered these functions do something this could be to interact with apis across the web or it could be performing calculations and data manipulations on some of the inputs that it received and more a simple example would be a capitalization function that expects some text as an input and returns the capitalized version of that text inside that function there would be logic to capitalize all the letters before returning that as an output when we create tools for our agents we are creating a function that do a specific thing which your agent can use whenever the conditions are met what makes gpts and agents so ridiculously powerful is how they can handle inputs and outputs of functions when the user triggers a tool e You by saying capitalize this text and then enter some text after the agent is able to pluck out only the text that they want to capitalize and use that as an input in into the capitalization function then once it has run the function and has capitalized the answer it can use that in writing a natural language response to the user and say here is your capitalized version and then input the capitalized version so it's not just going to take the input and then dump the output back into the chat it's actually going to answer the question and use the output as part of that answer in a way that's very very user friendly and natural this may not seem crazy to you but in the programming world this super intelligent and and conversational use of functions is a gigantic Leap Forward in order to be able to do this a decade ago would have been a complete nightmare now here are some more advanced examples of tools that you could create for your agents firstly you could have a stock price feature this tool would take and the stock ticker that the person is looking for EG what's the price of Apple right now and then the function that the tools connected to would uh use an API like the Yahoo finance API and would send off that ticket and would get the information back then it would respond to the user with the price of the Apple stock at that point in time or you could create a solar savings calcul calor which I've actually done in a previous video which I'll link below what this still does is takes in the user's address and their monthly power bill and it sends it off to a custom function that I created that uses the Google solar API to calculate how much they could potentially save in a 20-year time span tools like this are great for lead generation chat Bots for example you can put this one onto a solar company's website they can get their uh Power or the savings calculated then right after that I'd prompted this assistant to ask for their lead information directly after they got their quotation so they were able to capture that lead and then follow up with them after that and finally you could have a generate draft contract tool this would take in things like the contract type the value the recipient address and the name and then use a pre- prompted tool on relevance AI which we're going to learn more about in a second in order to generate a draft contract in seconds using the company's regular format for contracts the good news is that creating tools like these has never been easier for people who don't know how to code platforms like relevant AI that I'm a huge fan of allows you to build complex tools without coding and then a couple of clicks can connect those tools to your gpts and agents in order for your agent to be able to use your tool you need to create an API that wraps around it this is essentially a special URL that your agent can call which will firstly trigger the function that you've made secondly accept any inputs collected from the user in the chat interface and thirdly send back any data needed to write a response to the user therefore the easiest way to understand a tool is to see it as some custom function wrapped in an API that allows our gpts or agents to interact with it over the web cool right I know there are a few different ways you can create tools some are very beginner friendly and others are more advanced firstly you can find free apis and use them as tools you have sites like rapid API which have a bunch of free or cheap apis that are ready to use this means that someone has already created that custom functionality or the function itself and wrapped it all in the API for you to use so it's going to save you a lot of time you can go on to Rapid API pick a couple cool ones that you like and make tools out of them and then connect them to your GPT it's like a beginner friendly way to get started with tooling secondly you can create your own using no code or low code tool Builders as mentioned platforms like irrelevance AI I might go to for creating tools for agents when I'm not custom coding them myself I love the platform because it's extremely beginner friendly with tons of templates to get you started but their tool Builder also has a lot of depth which allows you to create some very Advanced tools as your skills improve if you've watched my videos before you know that I'm very big on this kind of depth concept when it comes to learning new platforms and tools if you're going to buy learning a whole new platform you want one that's not going to have a a ceiling in terms of what you can develop you want something that's going to allow you to make everything eventually as you get better and better and develop a more valuable skill set I actually already have a tutorial on relevance AI tooling for your gbts and I'll link that up here if you want to check that out it'll also be linked in the description and that video is a good intro to tooling with relevance AI I've actually been thinking of doing a complete guide to Tool creation for beginners in a similar style to this so if you want me to do that be sure to subscribe to the channel of course so you don't miss it but also head down to the comments and let me know if you want me to get that out sooner because whatever you guys want if there's enough demand I'll do it and of course this app here connects very well with GPT so if you want to connect your zaps to your agents and opening up really thousands of tool options with all of the zapier Integrations you can use zapier as well finally you can create your own custom functions and host them yourself of course you can just write functions with traditional code and host those apis yourself I actually have a bunch of tutorials sharing my custom tools for gpts like that solar calculator that I just mentioned so if you want to check those out I'll leave the those link down below as well but if you're a beginner I would start off with the rapid API and kind of pre-made API options and the low code noow code Builders like zapia and relevance AI for your tools there's one final component to creating tools which is creating an open API schema this is essentially instructions for your GPT or agent on how to correctly use your API so because your API might take in certain inputs it might be expecting certain inputs and and provide different outputs you need to give your agent a description of of how to interact with that API which is what the open a API not open AI open API schema is this is an absolutely crucial step and can seem a little bit tricky to beginners but I've got some super simple techniques you can use to quickly create your schemas which I'll be sharing with you once we get to the building phase of this video and as mentioned in the next chapter of this course I'll be walking you through creating your first tool and connecting it to your GPT we're almost done but there is just one more skill that you need to know before you can get started as a GPT store Builder skill number five GPT marketing the final piece to the GPT puzzle for anyone looking to make money on the GPT store will be marketing you can make it the most amazing GPT on Earth but if no one knows about it then you won't get any usage therefore you won't make any money while the GPT store will undoubtedly have some kind of discover feature that will Spotlight the top gpts or open AI picks but relying on this kind of exposure is not a very reliable method for marketing your hard work like I said people who have an audience or can use social media to get eyeballs to their gpts will gain more users and therefore rank higher on the list and therefore gain more organic users from being on this list Etc it's like an upward spiral of success for example the grimoire GPT which is a 100x coding assistant that I mentioned earlier in the video was cleverly marketed across platforms like Reddit tool sites like super tools and heavily on Twitter if you don't already have an audience then this GPT store moment might be a great opportunity for you to start focus on just one platform like Twitter and specialized in creating handy gpts or just one really good GPT for a specific type of user this guy has clearly focused on making a GPT that's handy for people who want to write software but aren't technically capable with the audience he's built up on Twitter he could now release new ones and new gpts that solve different problems for that same audience and likely see similar success one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that on the GPT store you will have a builder profile which is where all of the gpts you create will be attributed to with these Builder profiles in mind niching down to one industry or one type of user could be very handy so that you can become the go-to guy or girl for any gpts within that Niche so how can you Market your gpts the main ones I'd consider would be Twitter Youtube LinkedIn and short form content be it through reals or shorts or Tik Tok depending on your end user you will need to choose a platform that matches best with who those users are for example if you created a networking tool that would obviously be best marketed on LinkedIn with written content and video posts however if you had H gbt that helps students maybe that would be best marketed through short form content platforms where there's a lot of students and young people watching content you get the idea I highly recommend that you just focus on one platform at first as too many beginners try to be good on all platforms end up being bad at the all at once focusing on just one platform like Twitter or LinkedIn or YouTube and getting really good at creating content that generates new users for your gbts is the best way to go in my opinion I mean in my experience all I started with was YouTube and things have gone pretty good for me we only really just scratching the surface here in terms of GPT marketing ideas and I think we'll see some very interesting marketing methods over the next couple of months and years you could create full landing pages for your gpts to explain its value like the the data used the actions included and then even like run traffic there from Google or Facebook like so many different possibilities here you could even create a funnel of gpts for one Niche where each of them has been prompted to kind of link to the other GPT when a certain topic is discussed so kind of like interlinking your GPT so that they start using all of the ones you offer for that Niche if you get what I mean you can prompt it and provide links to them yeah anyway getting a bit distractive hey guys sorry to interrupt video video but before we get into the creation module I just want to ask you to head down below and leave a like on the video if you're enjoying I put a ton of work into this video as you can probably tell it's a lot more to come but if you also want to subscribe to the channel while you're down there a lot of you guys aren't subscribed to the channel or watch my videos anyway so if you want any subscribe so you don't miss out on more stuff and support me to doing to put this kind of free stuff out you can please subscribe down below like leave a comment if you are as well it's all for me we can get back to the video now' been brought up to speed on everything you need to know about making the most with the gpts and AI agent opportunity we can get into the final chapter of this course which is creation I'm going to be taking you step by step through creating your first GPT using all three ingredients and then I'll even go one step further and show you how you can Jailbreak it into an AI agent you can sell to businesses in multiple ways no other YouTube is going to be showing you that last part before we can create our GPT though we need a use case or a concept so that we can start to assemble the three ingredients for it for the tutorial we're going to be creating a Stock Investing assistant based on the wisdom of Charlie Monga Warren Buffett's right-and man at birkshire heatherway all of the resources including the prompts the documents and the tool templates will be available on my free resource Hub in the description below so you can create a free account on my resource Hub and get instant access and follow along if you're looking for the resources for this video it'll be on the left hand panel and down near the bottom somewhere for our planning we need to look through the lens of the three ingredients of course so firstly our promp thing is going to instruct the gbt to be an investing assistant that helps users to invest according to the principles of Charlie Munga using the documents providing we are not going to be authorizing it to make investment decisions on behalf of the user rather just provide some options so that the user can come to their own decision this is a bit of a legal gray area so it's important to not get yourself into any legal trouble by making financial decisions or or recommendations when you're not technically a financial adviser secondly our knowledge ingredient will consist of four documents that I've gathered the first two are PDFs on Charlie's investing principles the other two are transcripts from interviews I found with him on YouTube and finally our action or tooling ingredient will be a realtime stock data fetching tool that allows us to look up the price of stock in real time this is the most basic implementation I could think of for a Stock Investing assistant CU I think it's the easy opener for you as a beginner but if I was going to be making this GPT I'd probably use some kind of historical stock data tool that could get the past maybe 3 to 6 month of stock data which would allow the GPT to then kind of look over the stock data and analyze the past performance compared to other stocks past performance and then provide better recommendations based on this data so I think if you're looking to use AI as kind of a a data analysis and and reasoning engine that's probably how I'd attack this if I was going at it in my own time but for now for some publicity sake and to keep this easy for beginners we're just going to be doing a stock price fetching tool within this gbt so if you want to follow along head down to the resource Hub sign up and grab those documents then you can come back here and we can get started of course to get started we are on the chat GPT site here now in order to make gpts you do need chat GPT plus which is open now at the time of filming so make sure you sign up to a chat gbt Plus account I think it's $2 $30 a month or something then we can go to the left hand panel here if I go to explore gpts here is the new update of the GPT store at the time of filming the earli section of this video this hadn't released so here we can take a little look I guess while we're filming this um we have a featured section A trending section by chat gbt Etc doesn't seem to be anything crazy at the moment but it would be great if you could get on this featured or trending section all of you should take a look through here and see which ones are trending how they're being built and how they're being marketed as well but to get started on building our GPT we can click up to the right corner where it says create then we get this screen here so we can start to go through the process of creating it when you are creating gpts there is a create and then there's a configure section the create experience is a lot more conversational you can basically go through a conversation here with your gbt buildup and it's going to help you to construct it and convert your natural language into the ingredients here that we can actually put in ourselves directly so because we are smart GPT developers and GPT Builders we can jump straight to the configure page and start to build them quickly but also build them very specifically so we can tell it exactly how we want to do the prompting Etc when you do it through the create tab it's going to kind of make up the prompt along the way but we can be very specific with it here here we can give it a name we can say Charlie anger inting assistant the name of course is what's going to be shown on the store and some of the naming convention documentation that open AI is provided they say it's not recommended to put GPT in the name so in this case I've just called it Charlie M investing assistant um I can give it a description this is not going to affect the functionality of the assistant at all it's just going to be as you can see on the right hand side here this is the sort of description line of the of the GPT so I can say get help with your invest investing decisions using The Wiz Dum of Charlie manga and then we get to the instruction section which is the prompting ingredient of our GPT I already have one written here that's going to help us a lot um I'll go through this with you now you are an investment adviser that uses Charlie monga's wisdom to recommend investment strategies you are wise and have a long-term outlook on investing I'm going to add a little bit here for the legal side of things um you are not permitted to make decisions for the user only to provide options for them to choose between s then we reference the documents we've provided so a little bit of instruction on how to use the custom knowledge the knowledge ingredient that we're going to provide I've noticed it's very helpful to make sure it's using it at the right time so here I say you have been provided with documents containing transcripts from manga's interviews and also PDFs that are packed full of manga wisdom use this information to answer your investing related questions so that's telling it how to use the knowledge component which is something I recommend you all use when you're writing a prompt for your gpts if you're using a knowledge component and then this final line refers to the action or the tool that we're going to connect to it um you have one tool to help users get stock quote this function features the real stock data for a stock ticker provided by the user e Apple Microsoft Etc so that's telling it how it can use a tool which we're going to build in a second conversations are something cool you can add in for uh to enhance the user experience of your GPT I typically if I'm using it just a quiot prototype I'm not going to be writing them but if you are going to be putting these on the store and making it as user friendly as possible these conversation starters are an opportunity for you to really showcase the best of what your GPT can do in a little click button format so whatever I put here um I can do if I think about the most value that this gbt could provide would be uh probably related to the tool use um can you get this price of a stock for me so that's related to the tool I can say what are your five top investing principles for begin can you analyze this uh stock performance for me then then the user could paste in some recent stock performance data of the prices over the past 3 months or something um and then we can add on another one where it is how can I um evaluate a stock before investing these are all pretty helpful conversation starters I think think for someone who's looking to get assistance with investing getting a stock price analyzing the thoughts Performance top five investing principles for beginners evaluating a stock Etc these kind of things are going to pull from the knowledge base we use the tools or anything that we' provided as part of these ingredients to help them to do a certain thing related to investing then we get to the knowledge section which open AI has made very easy for us we can just upload the documents I will mention here that some types of information like like CSV and other files like this if it's a spreadsheet or any kind of numerical data the models are not that great at understanding that stuff right now um I assume that open a is going to release something that allows them to better understand or process these kind of numerical data sets at the moment I recommend anything text based so PDFs documents transcripts anything you can imagine that's text based that's going to be able to use that kind of knowledge much more effectively than your kind of numerical data at this point as I mentioned all the documents are going to be available for free on my resource Hub so if you want to follow along you can go down there and sign up and get access to these you can download them and you will get access to these four documents here so I've got two PDFs and I've got uh two documents the PDFs are from the internet and then the other two are transcripts I'm going to upload those there then we're able to enable some of the capabilities that open AI offers out of the box from their side to make opts more powerful at the moment this includes web browsing with Bing uh valy image generation and then code interpret as well so at the moment I don't think we need image generation web browsing could be handy essentially our stock data Checker tool um could be replaced with this web browsing one cuz it could search and find the price but for the sake of this tutorial I'm going to leave the web browsing capability on so I can pull some more data into the conversation using web browsing and say hey can you find me five stocks that have been in the news lately and pull those into the conversation then I can do sort of analysis and and pull data in ETC so we're going to leave web browsing on and then we get down to the action section which is where we can add in our custom actions which is what we're going to do now so if I click new action in order to create our action we need to find an API that we can use and then we need to create a schema for it which is what we're going to be doing now and as I mentioned one of the easiest ways for you to create your own tool and start creating custom actions is to find an existing API and then include that as one of your actions for your gbt so for a stock data price fetching tool I searched around for a free stock data API and I found this one here which is called fin hub.io no affiliation I'm just using it cuz it's free so you guys can get into it too if you're following along you can come to fin hub.io we can click on get free API key now I've already made a free account but you can do the same and you should be able to see the screen here which is when we get our uh free API key here which we can start to use in order to create our action or we need to know which particular API or endpoint we're going to be calling so thisf hub.io has a lot of different stock data related uh endpoints we can use this is something you need to get familiar with is looking at documentation and learning how to use these apis and I promise it's not as scary as you think so um if I go down here I think I saw one that I like which was stock price quote um so this is going to give us real time quote data for you with stocks constant polling is not recommended to get request and this is how we can use it here so essentially all we need to pass in as an input from the user end is going to be uh the stock ticker and it's going to give back the the current price the change the percentage change higher the day lower the day open the price of the day and the previous Clos price so we get this information back and all we need to do to call it is a little get request using this URL like this so if we decide to use this quote endpoint what we're going to need to do is collect on our gbt side A teer or a stock tecker say AAP for Apple from the user and the assistant or the GPT is going to take that include that in our API call send it off to finhub it's going to get the stock data it's going to bring it back and it's going to give us this payload we're not going to see that as a user but this is what the GPT is going to be seeing as the response so it'll give us back the information and then depending on what we asked say I ask what was the uh today's high the GPT is going to intelligently be able to pick out the high from this data and just send that back to us so that's what I'm talking about earlier in the video where I said it can very intelligently handle inputs and outputs and when is that we haven't really been able to do before which is what I I love about this stuff so much so now that we found an API that we want to use we now need to convert this into an open API schema as you see over here here's some examples if I go to the Json one we need to convert this API into a machine readable documentation or outline of how to interact with this API um this is what they look like open API title uh paths Etc so we need to convert house into something like this now this can be a very difficult process for beginners there's a lot of intricacies and and gotas that can really catch people off guard so I found which while for someone like myself or other people who know how to code it might be a lot easier to generate these but in preparing for this video I really struggled to find something that I was comfortable sharing with you all because there's so much complexity in these schemas I tried to create a gbt that would help you to create them very easily but again there's too much complexity so the easiest and most cost- effective way that I was able to find for you as beginners is to use a separate tool a separate platform that essentially put a wrapper around an API it allows you to easily input the information and give you a schema in a couple clicks and this is using a platform that I've talked about before on the channel I've done videos on them theyve been a guest Inside by accelerator so I'm very familiar with the platform but it's called relevance Ai and what I'm using relevance for in this video is to do exactly that which is to take an API like we found here and then put a wrapper around it and they automatically generate the schema for us which is great news for beginners and it's a really easy way for you to get your foot in the door and start building these tools this is not just a big sponsored video for 11 AI I literally took the whole night last night TR to find an easy way for you to do this and I came to the conclusion that relance was the best way and that's why I'm sharing it with you because I think it is the best thing for you as beginners so to convert our finhub API inpoint into a tool we can use in our GPT we need to hit to relevant ai.com and here you can sign up to a free account yes they do have a free tier which is another reason I like this method because I have a free tier which is going to allow you to get up to 10,000 runs uh for free so you can prototype and test out your own agents and start to use tools and custom Tooling in a very easy way go ahead and sign up for an account I'm just going to loog log into mine and then you'll see the home screen that looks a bit like this I'm not going to go through explaining the whole platform I'm just going to show you what you need to know to keep this short we can head to the tool section and up in the top right we can click create tool start from scratch and then we get to the relevance AI Builder I do have a whole video showing you how to create tools with relevant AI which I will link in the description but for now I'll show you the quickest way we can do it for the particular API that we're working with first thing we need to do is provide a name and a description so we need to be very descriptive about how we title this because anything that we put in here is as natural language is going to be taken over to our open API schema and you can see here we have a description and we have the title and descriptions this natural language included in your open API schema is what tells you GPT what this tool is and when it's supposed to be used so if you see here on this uh location tool the description for it is get temperature for a specific location and then further down we have the parameters which is the the name of the location we've got a very good description for it which is a city and state to retrieve the weather for with without giving accurate descriptions of the tool itself and of the different components of the tool your actions are not going to work as expected so it's very important when we come up here we give it a a accurate name so let's say uh fitch stock Pro quote data the quote data is all of that high low close Etc data not just the price I'm going to say fit stock quote data uh bu stock tier we give it a description um fitch stock quote data by ticker EG EG Apple I think that's good fet stock quote data by ticker we can ignore the knowledge component we can add a user input here I'm going to add a text input and this of course is what the uh GPT is going to be plucking out and using as an input into the function so um here we'll have a stock ticker uh ticker of the stock to Fitch data for EG again being very descriptive here because this is going to be carried over into the schema for us automatically now what I like to do is just change this this is the name of the variable so when this is entered into this automatically by the gbt um for our sake when we're building this it's nice to know what the variable is so this can be called ticker and then when we go down a step we can add an API request and now it's instead of having to convert all of this into a schema that's quite a complicated process we need to do a plug in the details for this API as we normally would and then it's going to automatically convert that for us handy way to do this is to set this to curl and then we can copy this URL head back a get request you can see here um method is get so yep we're good to go there paste in the URL and then what we want to do is automatically oh we have a little quotation at the end there automatically inserting my API key this token here represents our API key so if we go back to here I can copy my API key and replace this boom oh it was already done maybe it's already done it for yours as well um but it might be good to check and then all we need to do for this one is to replace the symbol here I can delete that and I can insert the ticker so that's going to dynamically insert this ticker variable that our gbt is passing it's going to take it out of here insert that variable into the symbol we're looking for and we've hardcoded our API key in there and it's going to return it as the output here so let's give this a little run if I go uh msft and I go run all and just play that we've been able to plug in an API we found put in the dynamic data and get the output from it that we were expecting I will mention now that this kind of API is quite a basic one um often times you'll have to have in header which is like or theorization and then you paste in your key it's a little bit outside of the scope of this video that is definitely something I'd like to address in future so if you want to learn more about making tools more depth as I said I do want to do that full sort of hour 2our long video on F creation and I'll likely use relevance AI for a lot of that make sure you subscribe to the channel and let me know Down Below in the comments that you want to see that because there is a lot more to it but I'm just trying to keep it as simple as possible for this tutorial so now that our tool is working we've got all the descriptions done correctly we can hit save and then to connect them to our GPT relevance AI has made this super simple for us if I go back then I can click this custom actions gpts button then I can click this button then I can select the top one here now the cool thing is that you can select multiple I'm holding the command key so you can build multiple tools and relevant Ai and combine them all into one schema and then pass that into your gbt as well but for this case I just want to take this top one and then here is the magic dip that saves a ton of headache for you as a beginner generate open API scheme and it's automatically generated on their end I'm not going to go into dip on on all the information here I'm just going to copy this hit over the chat gbt I can delete this I can paste this in I'm going to format it and there we go so that's all in there and as you can see our descriptions have successfully been passed in there we have the operation ID the summary the description Etc which has all been passed over well and here we have things like the description of the stock ticket so this is one of the inputs stock ticket of the stock to Fitch data for ETC so all of our descriptions and hard work there hard work I mean it was like a couple words but have been par over into this so we have the natural language to describe what we're trying to do final step let to go back to relevance AI we can click on generate API key here we need to set up some kind of authorization that allows lgbts to use our elevant AI so they can build us a t so we can generate that and click copy and there's a little tutorial here that you can walk through um I'm just going to show you it without watching it but if you get Stu you can click here it's got a nice little walk through um we're going to come back here click on this Cog for the authentication step we can go API key we can go custom we can type authorization with a z and paste in our API key save now that we've got everything set up we can test this action so down here there's a test button press that give it a second I'm going to confirm it and if you click the drop down here it's super helpful to see some of the information okay so lgpt is sent away AAPL as the ticker input as we can see here we have the ticker input which is correctly passing some information off to very helpful for you as you're debugging this if anything goes wrong is to click this drop down here you can also see some other stuff here like okay what response data are we receiving um how are we calling it okay this is what we're sending off as params Etc so this is the data that we're getting back as I mentioned it just sends it back in kind of a lump of of Json it is and now gbt is smart enough to take that response and convert it into an answer that actually makes sense so here we can see as of latest data apple is $185 59 which as we can see if I go here 18559 18 18559 so it's working which is great um and that's how we can get our first tool set up within the GPT Builder here one last thing that I like to do just to make sure everything is is died in properly as you can see up here it is using this uh called the XYZ API uh with the DAT operation so what I can do is copy this it's obviously understanding from the references and descriptions we put in the schema what operation we want to use I'm going to copy that and head back to our prompting here as you can see I've got get stock quote I'm just going to replace this with uh fetch stock quote data by stock ticket which is the exact name as you you can see in the in the actions here as you can see the operation ID is fit stop quote data by stock ticket so if you want to make sure it's using the right API and and calling things correctly it is helpful to take that and go back to your instructions and include it somewhere so there's only one thing left to do before we call this a day on this GPT build click here we can use doly to generate a picture see what it comes up with now to generate this picture I believe it's only going to be using the name here and the description um so if you want to change the prompt thing for your image generation you can change that uh using these two Fields here I might use the instructions as well I'm not entirely sure seems to be taking a while I've noticed this recently with the IM generation so let's uh let's improvise we get a cool little pick of Charlie here looking badass upload photo desktop there we go I think that's better than anything Dary could have cooked up for us at this point we're almost ready to put it onto the store if I come over to the save button here can publish to just use yourself anyone with the links you can share it around to your team here when you hover over everyone it will say your GPT will appear in the explore gpts page if you click on the little pencil here you can see that we can start to modify our Builder profile here I have my name as Liam C otley populated from my building details you can also connect the domain here so if you wanted to link this back to your personal brand or your your own personal GPT Builder site which is entirely different thing that we can get into in another video you could have your own like GPT Builder profile site that's a landing page that shows the links to all your different gpts that kind of depends on you being niched down to a certain type of GPT or type of user that you serve anyway getting a bit distracted there uh receive feedback emails to your email there I'm not going to check this that's your Builder profile and it's most basic form I assume it's going to become a lot more uh in-depth over time but this is all you need to worry about your name and your website if you want to connect it and your feedback emails if you go down to our actions you have a privacy policy URL what open AI needs for your privacy policy is a link to a web page that has your privacy policy on it so to make this short and tweak for the video I'm going to show you a little bit of a hacky way to do this what we can do is come to chat gbt first we need to generate our privacy policy so if I create a new chat write me a PR see for my GPT called Charlie manga investing assistant and what I'll do just to give it a bit of context but I'll paste in this here here's some info on it there we have a quick privacy policy that's been weped up by chat gbt for our assistant now I'm not sure sure how strict they're going to be on this whole thing but just for the sake of this tutorial and just getting these up and running I'm sure there's a whole video that needs to be made on privacy policies and stuff like that um but in this case let's get it up and running let's copy that then we can head over to something called design a GPT which is what I mentioned in the intro um but this is a GPT that's going to allow us to create a website very quickly and it's actually going to host it for us so if I say create me a web page for my privacy policy and include all the the following Texs on the web page so then we can paste in our privacy policy then I'll put in contact details let's just go Liam mail.com of course use your own one and then uh privacy policy we can R some of this last updated at what is it [Music] 12124 and then see what this can create us I'll leave a link to the designed GPT in the description below so you can do the same now can confirm and then hopefully when we click this we will have our privacy policy boom just like that so now we have our privacy policy posted on the URL I've got them buttons up here that we don't need to use but this is a very basic and quick way of doing things I think design gbt is great for this um cuz hosting a web page and getting it up can take a bit of time if you're not familiar with how to do a lot of the stuff so there you go so we have all of the information I'm going to copy that link head back to chat GPT go down to our actions and go to the privacy policy and paste this in I can go up to save I can click on everyone and it's now available to be published there have my Builder profile category yeah probably research and Analysis is correct and then I can confirm and have go to publish my GPT to the store and you're officially a GPT store developer now I can give a go can you get the price of stock for me let's give this thing a try and expected it's asking me for the ticker so that it can use the tool use the function so it's going to try grab that input and then pass it do to our relevant AI tool confirm so our stock beta check is working correctly now that it's been published P refresh let's try another one of these conversation starters um how do I go new chat new chat um what are your top five investing principles for beginners now this should search the knowledge base and give us some Charlie Monga wisdom back that's friendly for beginners but I like to test both the tools and the knowledge base component cuz they they are two separate things that the the assistant has to use so it's good to test both as an investing thing Guided by the wisdom Charlie manga I recommend the following PR investing following five investing principles for beginners patience is key understand what you invest in emotional discipline learn continuously minimize stupid decisions Charlie Super Wise on that last one then minimize stupid decisions anyway so if you guys want to have a play around with Charlie Munga investing assistant and maybe give me a little bit of a usage run up on this so I can get some of that uh possibly non-existent Revenue sh there'll be a link down below if you want to play around with my investing assistant here at any point if you want to go and check on your GPT that you published you can click on explore gbts here and then up in the top right click on my gbts so here I have Charlie M investing assistant and as you can see it has zero chats and it's available to everyone so when you guys go down below and click it and play around with it I'm going to get some of those chats that stack up and if essentially that'll be the usage metric that I assume at some point you're going to get paid for so now that we've created a working version of this agent as a GPT now I want to show you how to jailbreak this GPT and use it outside of the chat GPT site this is a crucial step for you if you want to start selling gbts to businesses and you're going to need to create agents and deploy them to places like their website or their slack or their WhatsApp business line or their Instagram DMS Etc I've added in this next section of deploying to different platforms because this skill is something that very few people know how to do right now and this Market of deploying AI assistance is largely untapped I will mention now that the assistance API which is what allows us to create gpts that we can use outside of the chat GPT site it does cost quite a lot in terms of usage and it can be quite slow sometimes making it not really ideal for all use cases for businesses at the moment but this is to be expected with this new kind of technology and I expect open AI to push an update within the next few months that's going to reduce the costs of running these Deployable agents and to also decrease a response time and therefore making them a lot more attractive to businesses so we are early but I'd rather be early than late to get you started with deploying agents and gpts outside of the chat GPT site I'm going to walk you through how to put one on a website as a chat widget like down the little corner one of those little bubble p knowing how to do this kind of chat widget deployment opens up opportunities for you to sell AI assistant Solutions like customer support or lead generation agents to businesses and normally this kind of deployment takes a lot of custom code and messing around with multiple different platforms to get it done right on this channel I've made a bunch of videos on the topic already but many of these tutorials I found were were far too complicated for beginners a lot of custom code involved Etc which is why myself and my team at Morningside AI created agentive which is the easiest way to create deploy and manage a AI agents and no I didn't wait this long just to give you another sales pitch agentive is 100% free for everyone right now because I want you to be able to learn this valuable new skill without any Financial barriers agentive is in Early Access right now and it only has a fraction of the the features that we wanted to have eventually but it is enough to get you up and running and start deploying these onto things like websites to start with so what we're going to be doing is taking the exact same Charlie manga investing assistant that we created but we're going to duplicate it over to be on agentive so that you can start to deploy it to wherever you want and it on different platforms to start off you need to come on to the agentive landing page here it's going to be link the first link in the description should be the one to agentive so you can come and get this at the moment it is as I said An Early Access but if you apply to the waiting list by clicking this join Weight list button click here if you fill this out you should be allowed into the platform within 24 hours so you receive an email when you've been added to the wait list and then within 24 hours you'll be let in to actually start using the platform so keep an eye on your emails after you've applied to it so I'm sorry I can't leave you in straight away but there is quite a big cue that we're trying to get through and and we don't want to let everyone in all at once because it is an early access once you have got access you'll be able to put your email in here click sign in then you'll be emailed a link to a magic link to sign in automatically so go to your email click on that and it will automatically log you into the platform and here we have the interface for agentive now there's a little light mode dark mode here if you're watching this at night but this is the basic interface we have at the moment what I'm going to do is Click create assistant up here and we're going to go through the process of creating what we just made on the chat gbt site but on agentive and as you can see we've closely mirrored the experience so it's very familiar for you um we do have a bit of an ux overhaul coming in the coming months so keep an eye out for that however in order to unlock this GPT 4 1106 preview model which is needed to create your own GPT on something like ative you need to first go to platform. open.com and we need to unlock your account so you can get full access to all the models available so if I log in here or create an account if you haven't already and then we go to the side here and click on settings we can go to billing and here you'll see that I already have topped up $15 into my account and I've added a payment method so what you need to do to get your models unlocked so you can use ative and start creating your own gpts is just to add a payment method here then add at least $5 worth of credit here using this recharge and i' also recommend you turn on the auto recharge so that if you use up all of those $5 it will automatically top you up so be aware that as you are using this you will be build for API cost so just keep an eye on this to see how quickly you're spending there once you've added some credit you can go to the assistance tab here and we can double check that you have the model activated if we go create by click on the model dropdown you should see GPT 4 1106 preview if you see that you're ready to go back to agentive and get started and creating your own GPT but we can go basically step by step and let's go back here and edit this GPT and now we're going to be duping over this entire thing so I can go Charlie manga investing assistant go it there description copy this come back and get the instructions copy that put it there update that then I'm going to go to the knowledge I'm going to enable the knowledge base going to add files we need to add them in one at a time um this just a feature that we're work on at the moment but adding them one at a time ensures that we don't get a queue which has caused some issues in the past so we need to go through add the second one go down and add the third one and again these are all the same documents that are available on the resource Hub and the fourth one it's going to take a little bit of time for these things to process um but until then we can go and connect our tools once we're here we can click uh choose new tool provider and now we can go back over to relevance Ai and the exact same method we just use for our GPT but this time for agentive so if I come up to the custom acction for gpts click on this generate open API schema copy this head back to agentive paste it in it's already figured out what we're looking for I can go add authentication do the same process if I go custom and I go authorization head back to relevance AI generate me a API key copy that hit back paste it in here update the authentication create the tool tools and now we have our tool created of course it's just one but we can have multiple Tools in here we do have support for multiple tools and if we go to the knowledge I'll give this a little refresh should have processed most of these yep they all been processed correctly so if it says it hasn't been processed just refresh the page and it should update if it's been long enough tool set up everything else set up and we can give it a test one of the things that makes a genive different from any other platform on the marker right now is that we have this testing environment now it may not seem like much but if I go in here and I say hi what can you do not only can we chat to our assistant in here we can test both the knowledge based feature and our tools if you go over to the open AI playground and try to do the same thing you're not actually going to be able to call your tools that youve provided to it it's just going to kind of um okay yes we've triggered it but we're not actually going to process the the request and actually perform that tool what makes this different from the open AI playground which allows you to do a similar kind of setup process that we can actually conversate with our assistant here and test the tools that we've set up so I've provided access to our get stock data what I can then do is say can you get the price of um Microsoft I can actually test my tool in here which is something no other platform offers right now so gent is designed to be this platform where you can come in as either an agency owner and you're selling these other businesses or as a business owner coming in and wanting to test thing before you put it live you can have a full testing experience of how your user will get it here within the within the chat window so how we can see the current stock price of Microsoft it's successfully fited all the information we're looking for so we know that it is working and ready to go here if someone who's going to be building and selling these to businesses I can tell you that this is going to be an extremely useful prototyping and testing interface for you which is why which is how we built it now we're ready to deploy this onto a website up here we have the deploy button which I can click and if I click on the website option here um here's the information we're going to need you're only going to need a little bit of it so it doesn't look too complicated up here we say first time deploying to a website watch our tutorial here so if I click this we have a little tutorial here which obviously you don't need to watch cuz I'm I'm giving you a tutorial right now um but we have two buttons here which is one to download The Voice flow template and the second to sign up for voice flow so our recommended method to get these put onto websites is to use a platform like voice flow we have a template that makes it super easy for you to integrate with so if you haven't already you can click here and sign up to voice blow but otherwise you can click the download The Voice plow template button here and you'll get the template that's ready to upload and make this super easy for you over here I've already got an account for voice of course once you signed in and you've created an account you can click on the import. VF file up here and I'm going to go to my downloads I have the website template click on that I can open the assistant here now that it's created and there just a couple little things that we can change here and then we're ready to go so back in agentive here you can see it says replace your API key here if I go back to agentive here we have our API key we copy this head back to uh voice blow and click on this and down here we just double click here and replace our API key easy as that and replace our API key and assistant ID here click on this replace our assistant replace our API key again and now we just need our assistant ID which we can come back to agenta for and if you come down here you see your assistant ID assistant ID copy that head back to voice blow double click here paste in our assistant ID and everything else has already been set up in this template I created and then we can play around with a bit of this so hi I'm uh Charlie your investing assistant and we can change things around like I can help you with investing advice and also F realtime stock data for you just give me the ticker you're looking for EG ms50 now we should be able to give this a spin and see if it's working to test this you can go up to the top right hit run go run test and then what this is going to do is create a new session and this is basically going to put all messages that come through under this particular chair hi I'm Charlie your investing assistant I can also help you BL how can I help you today and what are your top five tips for beginner B let's check that the knowledge base is working and this of course is connecting to our agentive API here going to be pulling all of this functionality into this here and then we have it so when you see these little Source things pop up that means that it is using the knowledge base and you can remove these with a little JavaScript trick on here uh but for now we'll just keep it as is so here we have it working correctly and pulling our functionality from agentive now we need to take this and put this onto a website which is a fairly easy step from here so if I go back I can go to the publish button I can call this V1 and I'm going to click on the embed widget button and here we can modify the layout and the design of our chat widget so down here you can see a little demo of it um if I go Charlie Monga investing assistant so that's going to change the name over here let's go M so it's not cut off Charlie manga mango investing oh um forget after tab is closed and reloaded let's keep it there let's change the image of the assistant to be it's cool picture we got of CH and we can change the color let's make it oh that icon okay let's change the color to something a bit cooler dark blue maybe it matched that little pink that's kind of a nice looking dark purple I like that um change this assistant Avatar put it time as well and then we have our manga investing assistant ready to go now what we need to do is copy this and put it onto our website now just demo this I'll go free CSS I'll drop this link down in the description below it's just a free template that I like to use in these videos makes it a lot easier um then if I download this up here I can click here un zip it and then if I open up brackets uh you need to go to brackets.io I think you can download brackets the free code editor that you can use to uh pull up these website quickly and then in Brackets what I need to do is go to um open actually we can go to Open folder and if I go back to downloads open up this press enter on that now we have access to this if I click on the index. HML again I noted this is no code but this is literally like just copy and paste to get in So at the bottom of this index.html the same thing applies for whenever you're putting one of these assistants and adding it as a widget going to be scrolling down to this bottom section where you see all these scripts and then I'll just drop into here make a little bit of space and then I can paste in if we go back to this we can copy our web chat can paste this in here I can command s to save and then up here bracket allows us to do a live editor if I click cck this live preview it's going to pull up the web page for me now if I come down to the bottom right we see our chat widget here pops up hi I'm Char you're investing assistant I can say okay let's try do a tool call what is the price of Apple it's going to talk to our agentive system that we've set up and it's going to send back the response using the tool call that we've set up for it current price of Apple is correct great so now let's try it a little more complex what is the current daily price change for IBM and Microsoft compare the two little bit more advanced cuz of having to use the tool call twice so once on IBM second on Microsoft doing a process of comparing those two and its output daily price chain is current daily price at this the stock was trading at this when comparing the two both stocks experienced an increase in stock price Etc so they you have't that is how you can put your own assistant your own agent that you've created um both the same as we did on the chat gbt site but this time being able to jailbreak it out of chat gbt and putting it on a website now this same approach applies for taking it on to things like what's that business or Instagram DMS or slack or any other deployment that you can imagine for an AI assistant that is what ative is all about and that's what we are rolling out in the next couple of weeks it to be able to deploy to the different social platforms and other platforms that businesses use as well so you'll see this deploy tab we not just have website but a bunch more so if you want to get on and have a play around with it then it's going to be 100% free as I said before you can hop on here and follow this along step by step this has been just a super brief taster on how to create gpts and how to use that exact same skill set to create and deploy powerful AI agents for businesses follow we have covered a lot in this video I have had to leave a little bit out when it comes to the complexities of tool creation and Tool usage and APS authentication all this sort of stuff it's a little bit too advanced for this video I wanted to give you a beginner guide to get you started so you can take this exact same method use relevance AR for your tooling you know how to do all that now but if you do want to see me do an entire guide on how to create advanced gpts and AI agents with tons of real world use case examples then be sure to subscribe and let me know down below if the demand is there to create an in-depth guide on Advanced Tool uh creation and things like that then I will make the video for sure so let me know down in the comments below subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and if you've got any value while you're down there please leave a like on the video it would mean a lot to me and also a reminder that agentive is 100% free for the time being so if you want to sign up and have a go you can head down below to the description and sign up there within 24 hours you should be led in so that you can have a play around so what are most important takeaways from this course firstly AI agent creation is going to be one of the most valuable skills to make money online in 2024 and Beyond not only because you can create powerful assistance to make you more productive in your personal life but you can also build and sell AI agents to anyone who needs them I believe if you're going to learn a new skill and go all in on it it is crucial that you're learning something that you can make money from for the years to come since all the big tech companies are rushing to create AI agent platforms by mastering the use of the three ingredients and the five key skills covered in this course will put you right in the middle of the AI industry with a skill that is in high demand secondly while the GPT store may not be a great option for some the bigger opportunity is taking that same skill set and using it to create agents for businesses and integrating them with their operation just as people made million building websites and building mobile apps the same need is there to be building AI agents over the coming years for businesses and finally if you are going to go all in on this new opportunity be sure to check out agentive it is free to start deploying your own AI agents and selling them to businesses as you need I want to end this video with some action steps for each of you so you know exactly where to go after you finish watching this video firstly subscribe to the channel if you haven't already as I said I have a ton more super helpful info coming on things like tool creation GPT marketing that will be hugely valuable for you moving forward and while you're done it please leave a like on the video if you've enjoyed you can join my free telegram you can join my free Discord you can sign up to my free newsletter and get all of my free content whenever you need it across all my platforms all I'm talking about is how you can best make money and build business businesses in this AI boom that we're experiencing so if you want to get all that information be sure to sign up to all those in the description below as I did mention earlier I do have a paid Community if you want to get in there where myself and my coaches and my team teach people how to start and scale their own AI agency where they sell these kind of solutions to businesses over the coming weeks both myself and my coaches will be breaking down these key skills covered in this video within workshops for our paid members so if you're interested in getting access to that you can sign up below and get further help on starting your own AI business secondly start researching some use cases for gpts and AI agents so you can try out that Reddit research method tool I mentioned called Gummy Search or you can go looking for some interesting data or apis that you can use to create tools for your gpts thirdly you should then go and create your first few gpts and get used to combining the three ingredients in different ways to get different outcomes and number four once you've got the hang of it you should consider picking a niche or area that you want to specialize in and go deep on creating gpts that help that one kind of user and number five you can then start to build your building profile around those kind of people and begin building an audience on a platform of your choice by sharing helpful content on things like Twitter or YouTube or LinkedIn or short form content number six you can then look into how deploying your gbts onto websites or other platforms via agentive can help you increase your income further if you want to learn more about starting an AI business you can check out my complete 2hour guide here taking you through step by step but that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and congratulations on making it to the end I wish you all the best for 20124 and we'll continue to do all I can to help you make money with AI and build a life you truly love living I'll see you in the next one oh"

              "text": "here is the easiest way to create your own gpts without chat GPT plus and without spending $20 a month not having access to gpts is a massive disadvantage for anyone in the AI space right now as you're not only unable to build your own gbts for personal and business use but you're also unable to develop your skills as a gbt developer which I believe will be one of the most valuable skills in 2024 luckily for you in this video I'll be showing you a dead simple way to get access to build use and share your own gpts without chat GPT plus and for a fraction of the cost if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I run my own AI development company called morning site Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the gpts that you're about to build let's get started in order to start creating your own gpts without chat GPT plus you need to sign up to my new platform called agentive which at the moment is free for the time being but there is about a 48 to 72 hour delay to get in so there's a little bit of a wait list as we onboard users but in the description you can sign up so that you can follow along with this when you're ready this is the sign up and login screen here so you can click on join waight lless so you can get access but I already have an account so I can jump in and log into the studio here and this is where we're going to be building our gpts and how you can chat to them in this interface here in order to show you what gpts you can build on ative and how it works I'm going to be creating a Charlie manga investing assistant which is going to have a bunch of documents based on Charlie manga's um investing principles which rest in peace to charie manga he passed away early this year I believe so in order to bring him back to life we're going to be taking a bunch of his his wisest sayings and and principles for investing putting those into the PDF documents that have taken off the internet somewhere and then I'm going to give that as a knowledge base then also to show you how we can add tools to our gpts on agentive I'm going to be doing a stock data fer so you can pass in a stock ticker say apple and then you can get the stock data for that so you can have a handy Charlie Munga GPT here on agentive to use the way this works is that agentive uses the assistant API to allow you to build your own gpts on top of it and all we do is give you an interface to build it and chat to it that no other platform office right now however in order to unlock this GPT 4 1106 preview model which is needed to create your own gpts on something like ative you need to first go to platform. open.com and we need to unlock your account so you can get full access to all the models available so if I log in here or create an account if you haven't already and then we go to the side here and click on settings we can go to billing and here you'll see that I already have topped up $15 into my account and I've added a payment method so what you need to do to get your models unlocked so you can use ative and start creating your own gpts it's just to add a payment method here then add at least $5 worth of credit here using this recharge and I'd also recommend you turn on the auto recharge so that if you use up all of those $5 it will automatically top you up so be aware that as you are using this you will be build for API cost so just keep an eye on this to see how quickly you're spending that once you've added some credit you can go to the assistance tab here and we can double check that you have the model activated if we go create by click on the model dropdown you should see GPT 4106 preview if you see that you're ready to go back to agentive and get started and creating your own GPT to get started I can click create a assistant up here and it lets me know that I have created a new assistant uh let's call it manga GPT pretty cool Charlie manga wisdom for your investing decision this description doesn't have anything to do with the actual functionality it's more for sharing it as I'll show you in a second then we have instructions which I've already pre-written so with that prompt being done telling it how to use the knowledge and the tools we're going to use I can go to the knowledge section and I can upload some files here I've got a couple files that I'm going to put in just going to give it a second to populate those in and they take a little while to process as well so we'll give that a second and we'll head over to our tools and start setting up our single tool which can fit a stock data by its ticker in order to get the stock data i' searched up free stock data API and I found this one called Alpha Vantage and I went on here and I got a free API key provided my details here got my free API key and I headed back to the documentation which I went down to the quote endpoint could it looked like if I click on this it shows me the kind of data that I'm going to get okay this is going to give me um the symbol the open the high the low the price the volume Etc so in here is a bunch of data that's pretty handy for what I want to do in order to connect an API like this as a tool we need of course an open API schema that explains to our assistant to to the open AI apis how to call it and what information we need to send off to it in order to get what we want back so the little trick to doing this is taking some information like this um going over to chat GPT our good friend saying I need an open API schema for this API col and then I put in this information here that which tells it how to call it it's also helpful to give it an example output so I can click on this here I did before and say okay let's copy this and I'll come down and say here is an example output and one thing to notice this does get a little bit tricky sometimes is the API keys if we go back to the documentation we can see here that it has API key as a a parameter in the URL in order to get chat gbt to give us the right one out I like to put in um do not include the API key as a parameter in the schema it will be provided elsewhere and what I also like to do is provide an example of a tool so you can come back to agentive here and and we can go to uh upload a tool and then we can click on predict age here if I go remove I can copy this and then paste it back in here here is an example of a open APO schema copy this style exactly and I can paste it in there so we have three components this is an excellent thing for you to learn as you're starting to create more gpts and becoming more advanced as a GPT developer is how you can convert any API you find into a tool and this is a basic way to do it using chat gbt so I give it how to call it I also give it an example of the output from the API then I give it any extra instructions needed like this API key part then I provide it with an example of a working one that we want to copy so all of this The Prompt and everything that I cover within this video If you're trying to follow along will be available on my free resource Hub down below so you can click down there sign up and you'll find this down the bottom on the left panel you'll be able to get everything that I've mentioned in this video so that you can make the same one so if I hit enter here give it a second it's going to generate me the schema okay so it's B this out but I'm not too happy with some of the descriptions here it is important that you get the right tone and use of words on here it keeps talking about global quote data and it's called the function get Global quote I'd actually prefer it to be get stock data by ticket it's a much more obvious name for what it's doing but can you modify it to be called get stock data by ticker and all the descriptions should in that this allows the user to get stock data by a provided ticket and now I have an updated version that I'm confident to use because it's a lot more accurate in all these written descriptions as to what we're trying to do here so I can click copy at the top right come back to agentive and I can come to the tool section and click upload tool paste the in here and then we need to set up the authentication for this particular API which we can do by clicking here and we know it has an API key because it has it in this documentation here so API key we want to click on API key and then we need to get the API key that I showed you how to get earlier and I can paste it in here and then the query parameter name is not API unor key in this case you can see that there API key so we can go API key update authentication create tools give it a second and we see that our knowledge documents have finished process processing uh now we're good to go on the tool side of things so we can click update here save our assistant give it a little refresh and start talking to it and make sure it's all working what can you help me with because we are using the assistant API we only have a little buffering symbol here we don't actually get to stream the data in as we used to with chat G that's one difference between this and what you used to on the chat gbt Builder if you've used that that we don't get a a nice stream of data it just comes in in big lumps like that I can assist you with a wide range of investing related inquiries um and the principles and wisdom of Charlie manga additionally if you have questions about specific stock tickers I have a tool that can fetch real time stock data so if I go right how's Microsoft doing now it's going to attempt to call the tool that we've created great so Microsoft are trading at BL and we've got a bunch of information back um so our stock ticket tool is working correctly now we can go what are your top three investing principles for beginners and seef the knowledge base is working and using the documents we provided there we go based on Charlie mongus wisdom here are three important investing principles for beginners to consider and we have a couple things sit on your ass investing avoiding overleveraging Etc you know the knowledge base is working when you see these Source things popping up so that it's actually getting it from the knowledge base not just from its general knowledge and that's pretty much it we've been able to create our own gpts and this one in the style of manga GPT with both tools and custom knowledge added and now we're able to practice Building gpts without access to chat gbt plus and what's more agentive is great in that it allows you to easily deploy this onto things like websites if you click this but here we have a website tab here which shows you how to easily put this onto a website we have even tutorials to walk you through it up here how to deploy to websites with voice flow and probably more important for you if you are looking to just use it for gpts we do have a share button here so you can turn on share links you can copy this and you can send it to anyone you want as long as they're able to sign up and get access to agentive they'll be able to use your gpts as if you've shared them on the chat GPT site and that's all for the video I hope you're able to get in here start building your gpts and sharing them around with whoever you want putting them on the websites wherever you need to do that I know some of the tooling that I showed in here might seem a little bit Advanced for some of you but I do have a ton of content coming on tooling how to understand them how to build custom ones how to use other people's apis as tools Etc so if you want to learn about that and learn how you can make your gpts even more powerful so you can sell them to businesses or really enhance your own gpts for your own business use be sure to subscribe down below while you're there if you've enjoyed please leave a like on the video it really helps me and my channel out while you're down there leave a comment letting me know what you'd like to see more if you have any questions about ative I'd love to hear them and of course as I mentioned all of the resources required to create the same GP going to be available on my free resource Hub so you can sign up down there get access and copy exactly what I've done here if you want to see a tutorial of me putting this on a website I have a video here that have just posted that you can watch but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you step by step a super simple new method to add your custom gpts to any website in minutes without coding a few weeks ago I made a video showing you how to put custom gpts on websites which got a huge response there was a lot of custom code involved which I knew many of you struggled with so this video is supposed to be much shorter and it doesn't require any coding by the end of this video you'll know how to put your custom gpts on websites in minutes so that you can level up your business with AI or build and sell custom gpts to other businesses as an AI agency if you are new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development company called Morningside Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money selling AI solutions to businesses just like the website chatbot you're about to build let's get into it the way we'll be creating these custom gpts and rapidly deploying them to websites is with my new platform agentive myself and the team at morning side have created this platform to make creating managing and deploying agents dead simple for business owners looking to utilize a Workforce of AI agents or for agency owners looking to create and sell agents to other businesses in its current state agenta focuses on making the testing and deploying of your custom gpts as easy as possible you can sign up to agent of in the description below it is currently 100% free for all to use however we do have a 48 to 72 hour wait to get in as we slowly onboard new users so please be patient with us in this video I'll be creating a gold investing assistant that has a custom knowledge base of gold investing guides and a realtime gold price tool so when I talk about assistance I always talk about the three ingredients prompting knowledge and actions prompting is going to be telling it that it's an AI assistant for helping with gold investing then we have some knowledge based documents for gold investing and then we have a tool that gets the real time gold price for us step one is to head to agentive hub.com and here you can either join the wait list or you can sign in I'm already logged in so I can go to here and this is the assistant creation page I'm going to hit up to the create assistant button click create new assistant here we have a new assistant that's been created okay so we can rename it also say um description this is just a written description doesn't actually do anything for the functionality and then for the instructions I have a prompt ready to go that I'll paste in here so that's all of the prompting so ingredient one done we can go to the tool section here which I'll do in a second but I want to jump to the knowledge component next so we can upload files here and add knowledge to our knowledge base I'm going to go here I have uh some documents investing in gold how to invest in gold and another one so I've just grabbed these off the internet I'm going to stuff all in there as knowledge based files and give this a second to upload them all helps to refresh and you can see them uploading okay and while we're waiting for the last document here to finish processing and uploading we can head over to creating our tools so as I mentioned I wanted to add a live gold price tracker some of I'm asking my assistant for help with my gold investing I can get the live realtime gold price in order to create these custom functions I need some kind of API that I can call now I don't want to have to make this Gold Tracker myself what I did was search up free gold price API and I came to this one here called metal price API and I signed up for a free key and then I get to the dashboard here so you can go metal price ai.com link will be down below I'm not sponsored by these guys at all um and then we have the dashboard here which I've gone in and created my API key ready to go and the next step here is actually the trickiest out of the whole lot which is we need to convert this API and this functionality into an open API spec that we can pass into agentive in our tool section here we go upload new tool so in order to do this we need to open up our good old friend chat gbt I can come back to the dashboard here and we need to take this information I'll copy all of this and I want to paste it into chat GPT I'll say write me an open AI um schema or this API then I pass in the documentation on how to call it and I also need to give it some examples of how it's going to respond so there I call it if I run it this is the kind of responses that it's going to be giving so I can copy this and say um this is the example output paste it in there then what I like to do is go back to agentive and I can go to pick an example let's get this predict age I'm going to remove that and just copy this again come back and say here is an example copy the style exactly paste it in there then it's going to create me an open API schema for this particular API that I can pass in now we've generated a schema that we can paste in there's just one thing that you may have noticed which is the API key is being expected as an input I would like to use my API key every time I call this so I don't have to paste it in and use it every time I do it so I can come down here and say I have my key and want to use it every time this is called can you pleasee this in and write me the entire thing okay we can go back to our dashboard copy the API key be paste it in there as chat GPT says here it's not uh generally recommended for security reasons but for the sake of the tutorial I want to show you guys how to get this up and running as quickly as possible so we'll just use it for now and there we have it you can see the default is set here I'm going to copy this now head back to agentive and I'm going to delete all this and I can just paste in the specification here and it's going to automatically detect that there's a tool and now we have this get latest middle price as a tool and we can create the tool here if we give it a second now we have this tool provider of api. mprice ai.com and we're ready to give this a test okay so now we can test if our tool is working so if I go price should call our tool and give us our answer back which would be about 1950 1970 uh us per ounce great so 1 1979. 54 USD per ounce so great our our tools are working now we can test our knowledge base so if I go what is the best way to budget see if our knowledge base is working correctly there we have it given us a bunch of information on ETFs gold ETFs recommending ETFs it seems and down the bottom we can see that it's coming from our knowledge base because it has this little Source marker here so knowledge base working tools working we're good to start putting this onto voice flow so that we can get it put onto our website on objective we try to make this process as easy as possible so we have our deploy button up here which has all the details you'll need and then we also have a little tutorial here so if you click through you can go to deploy to voice flow you can watch by little tutorial here if you'd like but I'm taking you through the live version now so what we want to do is click to on download The Voice flow template downloaded that you can click here to sign up for an account I've already got one so it's going to just take me straight to the Creator once I'm inside voice flow I can click on the import voice flow file up here now there is a 14-day free trial I believe on voice flow so you can get that and get instant access without have to pay anything um we've imported this correctly now it'll be this first one here agent of testing load this up and I've got a couple little annotations here replace your API key replace your API key and assistant ID so yep let's do that here we have our API key if we go back to agentive go back to our assistant and we can go to the deploy button the curl option and then we have our API key here that I'm going to copy go back to voice flow replace the API key down here same thing over here on the post request to generate a response I'll replace the API key step there and I'll also need to get our assistant ID which I go back come down here what's my assistant ID copy this and the rest of the setup has already been done in the template we are already inserting the correct Dynamic variables from the users so now I can just make a couple edits let's go I'm your gold investing system I help you with gold invest digies and and can give you the current price of gold gold how can I help you today and with that we should be good to give this a SP hit the little play button run test Hi how are you make sure you're just working on a normal question okay let's go try for a tool call what is the right now latest gold price is 1 1979. 68 which means we are successfully calling our tool and getting the gold price from our API which is great and I think we're pretty much ready to go and pop this onto a website we can hit Escape here and then I'm going to public publish it call this V1 give it a second to publish then I'm going to embed the widget when this pops up now let's call it gold Vore assistant I help with gold investing and let's uh forget the chat history after closing the tab let's make it a a gold color oh there PR gold um launcher have this as gold as well sure assistant image I'm just going to keep losing sign for now um you get the idea then I can come up here and copy this pull up brackets in this case You' put it onto your website whether it's a Shopify website whether it's a Works website whatever you need to do and you can come in and add this as a script tag to your website code so in this case I have a templated website from the internet that I've just downloaded for an example I'll delete this old one right down the very bottom you'll see um all this good stuff at the bottom of most web pages you're going to see a bunch of script tags like this I'm going to dump this right into the middle of them paste that there give it a save boot the website up and down the bottom right we have a little yellow bubble we have our golden V assistant and I can ask what is the price of gold I don't like that white text actually I probably would have changed it around and it's given us back the price of gold so the tool has obviously worked we can ask a questions about the knowledge base Etc but that's about it for the tutorial I hope you've been able to see the entire process and how agenter fits into this and just how easy we are trying to make it for you when creating and deploying your assistants to different platforms so expect a bunch more platforms coming out soon at the moment we're just supporting website deployments via voice blow we'll have a bunch more on the way and if you did have any issues with getting your tools set up in the same way that I showed here of generating that schema then be sure to subscribe to the channel because I have a bunch more content coming on tooling and how you can firstly understand them but then how you can build them how you can use other people's and stuff like that so make sure you subscribe for that if you don't want to miss it and down below of course you can sign up to agentive it'll be a 48 to 72 hour wait I apologize for the delay but we have so many people trying to get in that we need to like batch people in as we as we go so apologies for the delay but it is free once you get in so hope you guys can make the most of this and build some awesome assistance for your business or for other businesses that you're selling to if you do want to follow along with this build step by step and use the exact same information that I had I'm going to be putting it all in my free resource Hub down in the description so you can sign up there and get the knowledge base you can get the open AI spec everything that I've mentioned here in order to get this build will be available down in my resource Hub as well if you want to learn how you can make money with open AI gpts you can check out my video here going into depth on three different ways that you can make money but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you the easiest way to build powerful custom tools for your gpts without coding step by step using a new platform that no one is talking about right now this has been a highly requested video because many of you have started creating your own custom gpts but don't know how to easily create and connect powerful tools the powerful tools that you need to make your gpts actually useful for your business or for your use case the truth is these tools are where the real value is created with gpts but the process for making them can be very difficult especially for people who don't know how to code not knowing how to create these tools can prevent you from making the most of this new opportunity by the end of this video you'll not only know how to create and connect custom tools to your own gpts but you'll also get a head start on learning one of the most valuable new skills for anyone looking to make money or build businesses in the AI space in 2024 before everyone else catches on if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development company called morning side side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the custom gpts you're about to build let's get into it okay before we get into the build I do want to talk about just how important what I'm about to teach you is moving forward into 2024 because tool creation and being able to plan and create custom tools for businesses or for other gbt builders there's so much opportunity here that I really want you guys to just give me a couple minutes so that I can explain why this is going to be such an important skill to have moving forward if you've watched my recent videos you'll know that when I talk about gbts I say that there's always three key ingredients that you need to create them firstly being prompting second being the knowledge and thirdly being the actions for you as the developer or the Builder of this GPT of this assistant you have a canvas that you get to choose what you want to put on it or ingredients that you want to include in the dish so the different combinations of the prompting the the prompting information that you give it the knowledge that you give as its knowledge base the actions that you provide to it you get to assemble these and create different gpts and different assistants depending on how you use these ingredients now any idiot can use prompting we've all been prompting chat GPT for a year now so we know how to write instructions for the AI we know how to get documents and upload them we've had chat with PDF we've done all these things that leaves the final one which is actions and functions that are the sort of Last Frontier or final frontier of what we have to work with right now that is the most difficult area that many people are not going to be able to get into and really touch so if you're looking to play into this opportunity of creating gbts either for the store or for businesses you need to focus on the most difficult one and learn how to make custom tools and and focus your time on learning that as a skill so that you're able to create gpts that are far more powerful than anyone else which is what this video is about I wanted to introduce you to a way that you can create your own custom tools without coding in many cases which allows you to unlock a whole new world of potential for what you can include in your builds the terminology or the name for tools can be changed around quite a bit sometimes it's action sometimes it's custom action sometimes it's capabilities sometimes it's custom function sometimes it's tools they basically all mean the same thing when creating a tool and making it available to our assistant or our gbt it now has the ability to intelligently call that tool and in this case it's going to be functions or they take a couple inputs and we do some processing and we send information back or expect some inputs and then we go and do something in the background these are the kind of tools that you can assemble in the toolkit of your GPT to make it far more useful so for a business owner if they wanted to be able to update something in this CRM or that you wanted to be able to call an API and get some information from the web somewhere these kind of things can all be created around tools and in this video that's what I'm going to focus on teaching you how to do creating tooling like this is really the future and open AI is going all in on it we're just starting to see the other companies pick up on it as well we have Claude 2.1 by anthropic which is including Tooling in it as well and this is clearly the direction we're going where all these businesses who want to benefit from this new technology and from using assistance like this they're going to need to have custom tools created for every part of their business to connect into an assistant like this that can actually do things throughout their business because of this boomm that is just started of these assistants now needing tooling and custom tooling that can allow them to do things there's going to be a massive need for people who can create these tools and Tool marketplaces where you can sit down here and create what I'm about to show you and then list it on the tool Marketplace and people can start to use that in their own GPT so you may have people creating on the GPT store you can be a layer below that where you're like a tool that they can use to create the GPT and they can be paying you some of the money that they're creating off in this tutorial we are going to be creating an Outreach assistant GPT that has got access to three custom tools one is going to allow it to search and research a company by URL secondly it's going to find leads for that company so we can provide it a company name and also the role that we want to find for it it's going to find the person and the LinkedIn profile and finally it's going to be able to generate a personalized Outreach message for connecting on LinkedIn so kind of all ties together well and I thought I'd pick three different tools that you can combine into one GPT here and use it as a as an assistant for someone maybe in your team so you have a assistant or a VA that is going through it and finding and doing lead generation for you or sending Outreach messages for you this is a an example of how you can do that using custom tooling the most important part of this build is the platform that you can build your custom tools on top of as you've seen in my previous videos to create custom tools you typically have to use custom code you have to write get a repl out you have to write all the functions and and connect it all up and I know for many of you that's not not not possible uh at least if you want to take that and modify it and change the tools around it's not realistic for you if you actually want to start modifying these and making money with them so relevance AI is a platform that we've been working with in the accelerator Mya accelerator for a couple of months now as a as a custom AI application Builder but what they've recently rolled out is as you can see on screen here you can take any of the AI applications that youve built and there like no code Builder and then you can convert those into custom actions for your gpts and just a couple clicks so we're going to be going through and pulling some of the templates out to get started modifying those templates and then sending that over to our GPT and connecting them up as custom tools and giving you a demo so let's get stuck into it here on relevance I'm just going to log in once you're inside you'll have your dashboard like this now there is a free plan on relevant so you will be able to follow along with this and do everything that I'm doing without having to pay anything initially it's done on usage which is great but what we're going to do is go to the top left here click on templates and I'll show you how we can get started using some of the cool templates that they have before you go down to as we have down here the research if we go down to sales so here's some of the examples that I picked up before so I think I took the personalized LinkedIn request I took the research company with website research a company and fin lead was the last one so let me just check with these real quick and right away we can start to test these tools and see if theun functionality is something that we want to connect into our custom GPT keeping in mind that all of these fields that are required here so the first name the LinkedIn URL the context the company these are going to be expected inputs so if you want to use this tool in your custom GPT you'll need to trigger it and say hey look I want to generate a personalized LinkedIn request say okay great give me the first name LinkedIn URL so these are the inputs that are going to need to be provided to it it's going to take those inputs and essentially press this run tool button run it and do all the processing in the background and then spit back the answer to the user in order to see behind the scenes and how this is actually happening you can just click the Clone to edit button in the top right so I can clone this template and then you have all of that functionality that they've already built and it's laid out here in all of these steps now you can go through and and pick through all of these essentially this is just doing a getting the LinkedIn post from the LinkedIn URL running it through an llm so this is really cool because you can create these AI applications with basically no code this is all just prompting inserting the variables from the previous step nothing too complex which is why I really love relevance as a tool building plat and they are clearly pivoting very heavily to serving this new market because we have a lot of advanced functionality that they're building into if you watch my channel you know I'm super big on platforms that make it easy for you to get started but still have a ton of advanced functionality that you can progress to over time and you give six 12 months of using this thing and you become really really capable at building cool stuff so I love relevance for that case same with the other platforms that I use like make.com I think it has a ton of depth in terms of what you can learn over time and you can eventually 12 months down the line be a really capable automations Dev or AI entrepreneur whatever you want to call it so that's how you can clone templates and edit them for the sake of this video I've already gone through and edited some of these um as you can see on something like this uh company research and website I've taken out the context about the product and service so if I clone this you'll see that it's got this extra input which if you're using it for a GPT you don't want to have to be always putting in information about your business cuz if you're giving it to a staff member and say okay this is a company research tool you're probably only going to be researching on behalf of your company so things like this context about my product and service I don't think are really necessary so I've deleted this and you have to go through and remove it out of this so context about my product you can like go through and delete stuff like that don't worry I'm going to give you access to all of my templates so I've already modified these and these are going to be available on my resource Hub so let's just jump to that now where I show you the modified templates so here we have the first tool which is just general company research based on the URL so just pull some stuff off your company URL uh let's go goodyear.com give that to run and then we go we get a summary of the company back which might be helpful for our assistant or our VA who is using these tools and our eventual GPT which we'll get to in a sec okay so if we want to find a role in a company let's go add over into a voice flow and we want to find the CEO we'll see if we can find bradden there we go y it's found Braden ring has LinkedIn company website company summary we can copy his LinkedIn URL and take it over to the next step here if I past in his LinkedIn URL and I give it the first name Braden I can run the tool and it's going to generate a personalized LinkedIn connection request message that my VA can use these tools while they use the GPT that we're creating and then they can take this message that we generate and then they can start a connection request on LinkedIn to start building more of a of a network on LinkedIn and also open up the doors to potential communication as well there we have it I came across your LinkedIn and notice your recent post about AI techniques for conversational interfaces the topic my interest as many companies are seeking new B to enhance customer experiences through technology so that's personalized based off their recent post on LinkedIn if you want to come in here and modify the templates that I put on our resource H all so you'll be able to get this one this one this one so you can follow this build along step by step but if you do want to modify it you just need to click on the build section up here and then there's parts of it that you need to be aware of like the llm step where you have the prompting and there's sometimes going to be things that are specific to in my case morning side so take a look at the system prompt take a look at the prompt at all stages so we usually have a couple different llm steps um just be aware that there might be some stuff from my own company um that's used in the proding itself there definitely is in the generate personalized LinkedIn connection message one if you do want me to do a full tutorial teaching you how to build tools with relevance then let me know in the comment sections below because it's definitely something that I want to do at some point uh if you guys comment down below I'll definitely hurry that video up because I know even this kind of no code interface can feel overwhelming at First Once you have made the edits you want to make we can hit the save button in the top right just go through and make sure these are all good to go yep yep yep then we can go back to our tool screen here you will see in the top right there is a custom actions for gpts button in which case we can just take a quick look here make sure that I know exactly the ones that I want to use so find rolling company generate LinkedIn connection message and research from company URL so if I go click up here I want to get this one I want to get this one and I want to get this one now the amazing thing that relevance allows us to do is in one click we can generate an open API schema that we can copy and paste over onto the chat GPT site when we are creating our GPT then we also have a generate API key step which we'll go into in a second but this is the key part here where we've just converted all of the functions and the in the custom tooling that we've created on relevance we can now take this this code snippet this open API schema copy it not open AI open API it it's different but we can copy this and put this straight into the chat GPT interface when we are creating our GPT which is what we're going to do now actually there is one more thing that I need to point out before we get into taking it into the chat gbt side which is the name and the title and the description of your tools is very important because this is what's going to be carried over and basically be the natural language description of what your tools do so you need to be here and make it very descriptive so I've gone General company research from company URL do general research on a company based on their website so very specific about what this particular tool does in this case Find rolling company find the name of a person the output within a company by role by the input again and we have the generate personalized LinkedIn connection message write a personalized first line for an Outreach message based off a prospects LinkedIn profile so I've been very descriptive and very specific because when we take it over to chat GPT and we export this these tools and connected to our GPT that information is going to be used and help our assistant to know what tool to use and when and that's basically its description of the tooling so make sure if you are modifying these you're changing other tools that if your tools aren't being called correctly in chat gbt in the interface the issue is likely that you haven't been descriptive enough in the descriptions of your tools heading over to chat GPT now to start creating our gpts you do need to have the chat GPT plus I believe to create these GPT so if you don't have that already I think they've blocked it off so if you want to be able to create gpts you can sign up to my platform agentive which is in the description as well you can do this whole thing without needing to have a chat GPT Plus account for now we'll go in and create a new GPT as I said I'm going to jump to the configure because I'm a big boy um let's call this Outreach expert uh Outreach co-pilot give it a cool name it's going to assist my assistant in doing Outreach and lead generation for us so um assists with lead genin and Outreach then I have a prompt which I'll paste in here and we'll get back to in a second don't I need to do a little bit more so I can explain it to you then scrolling down we can check all of these capabilities off we don't need them for now but what we do need is the custom actions down here and this is where we can go back to relevant Ai and copy the schema copy this paste it in here and then boom we have all three of our tools that pop up here ready to use which we're going to use in a second but then the last step that we need to do is click on the Cog here on the authentication we need to go API key we need to head back to relevance click on generate API key copy this go back paste in the API key and then when we click on custom here we need to put in authorization which is a key bit that is it's very easy to forget when I click on Save here should be all ready to go with these all loaded in what I've done is copied these you can follow the same concept for creating yours if you are modifying and going away from this specifically but what I did to create my prompt is I copied all of these and I hit it back to the instruction section as you can see I've pasted in here I'll put it here so it's a bit messy but essentially I took that same thing I trimmed this down and I got each of the names of the actions as I have them here and then I did a little description of each so in this case I say generate personalized LinkedIn connection message this function generates D I'll let you pause it and take a look basically I'm just telling the assistant that they will have three action that are available to do this above objective and then I given a bit of an explanation on what each of the tools does and how they can use it the kind of inputs and outputs and stuff like that I also added this little bit at the end here which is when the tools return information the assistant does not need to give big long summaries because when I was testing it I notic that it it kind of rambled on quite a bit if you are creating assistants using custom tooling I do recommend that you add in a little description of each of the tools and sort of relate that back to how it's supposed to help the the core purpose of the assistant and with that I can generate a image with darly maybe I set a couple conversation starters I have some over here what can you help me with I have research a company these are the different actions or functions so this is how you can make it quite user friendly so for people when they first log on here they can click one of these buttons and it's going to allow them to quickly call one of the actions that you've made available to it so here we have Outreach co-pilot great we can give it a spin what can you help me with twet it's given us a breakdown of what it can help us with so let's go research make.com what it's starting an action and now it's asking us for permission to call that action which we can allow now it's talking to our apps that now tools on relevance AI as you can see here and there it spat back the response it is important when you are doing this testing in the configuration interface as we are in here so you can drop these down and here the first two that we have here is is like a checkin to make sure that we can approve it I think it's the request for approval and then we actually see what it's sending off so might look a little bit complex but the key thing here is that you can click this drop down here and we can see that it's sending off the params or the information that we're sending as an input is the URL to make.com which is what our general company research if we go to the Ed tab we can see that it's expecting a company website URL which is what we sending off so that means it's doing its job correctly and it's giving us back the response correctly then we can go a Step Beyond that and say okay can you find me their CTO and now we want to find make CTO oh we're going to allow it it's picked up on the function call correctly give it a second yep make.com and roll CTO those again with the two inputs that we expect the company name and the role to find the area that we just ran into here is a good one to run into while we're on this tutorial which is a timeout issue you may see this thing pop up over and over and error occur while executing the plugin that's because there is a 60-second time out I believe when I was talking to the relevance team there's a 60-second timeout that open AI allows so if your tool takes longer than 60 seconds to respond it's going to come back and not be able to give them the information that means at this stage some of the tools you create and connect to your gpts are going to need to be a lot shorter than you'd expect because if it takes 300 400 seconds to generate this big long response it's not going to be able to be used within your system well if make.com is not going to work for us let's just go back to the Old Faithful voice find the voice flow CEO allow calling and sent off voice flow and CEO it's what we want yep sent off the right params and then we have his LinkedIn profile it's giving us a bit of a summary okay so now we can try to generate a personalized connection message form based off of this so it should already have his LinkedIn URL which is one of the inputs we need here so we need the LinkedIn URL and we need the first name and in this case we have his name and his LinkedIn URL it's going to send off some information and then we have it it's used our tool to generate a personalized connection message for LinkedIn hi Bren I came across your LinkedIn profile notice a recent post about AI techniques and conversational interfaces this is pulling from his recent post which is great this is much higher converting than a a generic one that's just generated or written by a VA and then we have shown that all three of our tools are working within this editor here we can now save it I can go own only me there you have your own GPT that's created with custom tooling using relevant Ai and you can start to use this as however you need you can share it with the people in your team but the issue here is that you're only going to be able to use this within the GPT interface unfortunately if you want to take all this awesome functionality that you've built and put it on your website or use it via SMS or Instagram or Whatsapp your assistant is still going to be stuck on the chat gbt site now I've covered how to build custom gpts that you can use in the real world on my channel extensively so you can use them to drive real growth in your businesses but the process to actually export these gpts and assistance to wherever you want to use them is quite complicated for beginners right now which is why my team and I at Morningside have created agentive and yes I've been talking about this a lot recently but we have just opened up to our first 500 members and it's our platform that makes this entire process and putting this exact stuff onto your website or Instagram or Whatsapp wherever you need to do it makes it dead simple for entrepreneurs who are looking to take advantage of this but don't necessarily know how to code or don't want to do all the the heavy leg work of getting all the custom code ritten as I said we're currently in Early Access but we will be letting in batches of new users over the next week or two so if you want to get in there before everyone else the link to sign up to our wait list is going to be in the description if you haven't already we are super excited to roll out a ton more features on agenda very soon that'll allow you to do this and start to make money and build these for businesses and build it for your own businesses as fast as possible but the key thing here is that you've learned the skill of being able to create custom tooling which is something basically no one knows how to do right now so if you can learn how to use relevance or find other platforms if you wish I'm not forcing you to use this one this is just what I like using this is what my community likes using as well and I think the way that they are allowing you to create these custom tools and easily put them onto your gbts it's super smart and super user friendly for people who don't necessarily know how to code so that's about all for the video if you've enjoyed it please hit down below and leave a like on the video let me know that this is the kind of stuff you want to see more of as I said I think tooling is going to be at least one of the most valuable skills in 2024 and Beyond just because every business is going to need custom tooling that allows their business to interact or be or operated via these assistants so there's a going to be huge demand for it and if you guys want me to cover this more on the channel then let me know in the comments below if you want a full tooling guide I can definitely do one of those for you my way down there you can subscribe to the channel if you haven't already so you can stay in the loop on my AI entrepreneurship Focus content teaching you how to best take advantage of the AI opportunity and teaching you how to implement AI into businesses and sell as a solution so if that's interesting to you you can subscribe to the channel comment down below also and as mentioned all of the resources the templates for relevance everything that I've covered in here is going to be available on my resource Hub with the first link of the description so you can steal all that try to follow this build along step by step so that you can take this and start to apply it to your own businesses or sell it to others if you want to continue watching and see me put a custom GPT like this onto a website you can do so here but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

              "text": "there are literally thousands of business tools and softwares out there that you can use to start and scale your own AI automation agency which for beginners can feel pretty overwhelming over my five past years as an online entrepreneur and the more recent 12 months as an AI entrepreneur I've struggled time and time again to find the right tool for the job being sold the dream by an app only to waste countless hours and and dollars really on tools that didn't provide and that's why today I wanted to make this video to save you the hassle and the pain that I've gone through by condensing the hundreds of different tools that I've tried and tested out down to just the 14 mus have softwares that have helped me start and scale my own AI businesses to over $100,000 per month in Revenue firstly I'm going to be covering my recommended softwares for starting and setting up your AI automation agency to make sure you get off on the right foot then I'll be diving into the best softwares for actually building and delivering your AI Solutions before ending with three personal tools that I use every day to be a more productive agency owner that have made the world of difference for me in my own businesses and personal life now real quick before we get started I'm trying to better understand what kind of content you like to see what you don't what kind of stage you're at in your own business Journey so I've dropped a form in the description below um I'm going to be giving away a 20-minute Consulting call to someone who submits on their form I'd really appreciate it if you can help us out and make this channel better for all of you guys so please check it out down below okay so firstly we have slack which is your internal Communications hub for your business this is an absolutely crucial thing for you to have set up initially so that you can handle all the communications with your team but also Communications with clients as well so what you want to do is add all of your team members to your slack workspace and then inside the workspace you can add client channels on the leftand panel and what you'll do is create these as private channels this means you can add in just the team members that need to be attached to that particular client's project and then also add in all of the clients and their accounts into that channel as well so you have this little environment where all of the the relevant people are in there on your side and also on the client side you can keep all of communications sort of centralized there for the particular client sa also is very good for integrating with with other services like air table or zapia so that you can set up a bunch of automations to handle a lot of the processes as you start to scale your business moving forward so good thing about slack is that I think it's about $9 per person on the Premium plan so not super expensive early on and it really scales with your business as you grow secondly we have stripe which of course is to process all of your payments so when you want to collect payments from your clients you can send them a stripe invoice and then they can pay via stripe with credit card or they can even do other different methods as well so stripe is great um very easy to set up takes a couple minutes it's not available in every location so your country might be different one thing you need to be aware of when using stripe is the processing fees which is usually like a 30 Cent per transaction and then maybe a 3 to 5% on the overall transaction which can add up and I think even for for my business morning side because we're working in AED like durhams which is the local currency here in Dubai we get really hit hard when we are receiving payments in USD and it's converted into AED then when we have to pay out of the business again and USD we're getting hit with like multiple different transaction fees ends up being like 5 to 5 to 8 even 10% of the business Revenue sometimes so something to be very aware of but strip is a good place to get started so that you can start accepting payments for your customers thirdly we have notion which is like Google Docs but with easier organization of different files you get cleaner formatting options and really a ton of customizability in terms of how you want to sort of store your documents and present them and things like this I've been using notion heavily for both business and personal use this year um for the personal side of things I've been using a template for notion called my second brain which is something that I found hugely valuable and it took a while for to get really fully integrated into it but in terms of creating a second brain to manage all of your personal tasks and projects and documents and all of these different things it was something that I had really lacked as an entrepreneur leading up into this year but I found a template that's absolutely killer for it I'm such a fan of this template in particular that I reached out to the Creator and I've been able to securi ASE a 20% off discount code for you as my viewers on the channel CU I think it's so important for you all to get something like this just to start managing not only your personal productivity but also the business side as well so here has a a a template for personal productivity called my second brain and he's just about to release what's called business Os or business operating system which I'm currently testing the beta out form and I'm absolutely loving it we are transitioning everything over at Morningside and all my other businesses to use business OS as our Hub this has really been a complete game changer for me so I really want you all to at least check this out there's going to be a link in the description um there going to be the business OS which is on a wait list I believe he's doing a 50% off discount for people who purchase early so there might still be some if you click on that um but on the my second brain side of things is also going to be a 20% discount code for both of those if you use code Liam so that information will be in the description and the best part about this is that notion itself is free so that when you buy one of these 97 or $80 templates that you're going to get it for you can import that and that's sort of oneoff cost that you pay to have a full document management and processing system for your business next we have clickfunnels now if you've been watching my content for a while you know that my thoughts on websites are that you can end up wasting a lot of time especially if you aren't clear on who you are as a business and what you're going to sell by setting up a website and things like this you're going to waste so much time um what click funnels is is sort of a happy medium where you can set up a a quick one-page website using templates that they provide and so you basically get everything you need and nothing you don't you have a chance to communicate who you are and what you sell in a couple lines and you can have a button to book and a call that's basically all you need initially um so clickfunnels is a great way to get that up and W quickly and I think it's a 14-day free trial and it's going to cost you $127 per month so website builder if you're looking to start your agency off and you want to build a website for it clickfunnels is a great way to get that done in a couple hours instead of having to spend a whole week or something that you don't even know if it's going to really work for you next we have true conversion which follows on nicely from clickfunnels what true conversion is is a heat mapping software that allows you to insert just a little uh script a little bit of code into your website header so on clickfunnels you can paste that in very easily on any of these other website building platforms you can just paste in this little bit of code and what that's going to do is track all of the user behavior and and data from how people are engaging with your websites and then give that back to you on true conversion with very very actionable um information to show how users are using your website so this is hugely important for you and it's even something that I struggled with my own 0 to 10K case study is that I had this this landing page up and running so when I saw a true conversion pop up I thought that is exactly what I'm looking for to be able to sort of analyze what's working on my funnel and what's not the reason I was made aware of true conversion in the first place was the app Sumo team got in touch with me NOA Kagan and his team have been very helpful in sending me over some potential softwares that you as my community and my my audience might be able to benefit from in terms of applying them to your AI automation agencies now if you're anything like me and you'd heard of Appo but you weren't entirely sure about what they did and and how it worked basically it's a platform where you can get lifetime deals on software lifetime deals on software for your business um that you can go in and buy ones and be able to use forever so I thought this was a great opportunity when the team got in touch with me I'm not getting paid for this this is not a sponsored video I didn't accept any money from them um but they did give me some software that I thought could be very very beneficial for you all and purely on the sort of price point side of things I've heard a a lot of complaints sort of concerns about some of the software that I recommend being too expensive and sort of out of the price range of many of you and when I saw these ones at true conversion that I've mentioned now and another I'm going to mention later these are ways that you can spend sort of 8060 $70 on Lifetime software whereas as the competitors I think hot jar is the main competitor for True conversion in terms of making heat maps for your websites um hotjar costs like $50 a month or something so you do two months of that and you're already blown over the price you've paid for something like true conversion which I believe is $69 for a time plan so if you want to get some more information and insights on how people are using your funnel for your own business you can easily apply to clip funnels then true conversion is a great way of doing this I will have put some things up on screen of how I've been using it within my own Final on the 0 to 10kk study um so highly recommend it I think if you aren't already getting some more data like this on your website it's definitely something you should do so this will be linked in the description as well next we have closely which is another AB suumo software that I was recommended um they again have a lifetime deal I think it's $118 for you to get all of the features for life on this platform and what it does is combines sort of cold email Outreach by platforms like instantly with cold LinkedIn Outreach and sort of LinkedIn marketing and campaigns uh On Tools like drify so it combines Cod em Outreach and Linkedin Outreach into one tool where you can set up multi-channel prospecting so I've talked about this before and I think it is a really really good way for you to be able to increase the touch points on the different prospects that you're reaching out to for your business and when I saw this deal come through is as something that I could recommend to you I thought well the price of something like instantly and the price of something like drippy I think drippy alone is like $99 um so when you combine those two and you pay for those 3 months in a row you've spent like3 or $400 in software but you can spend I think it's $120 to get U two of these different credits for you to get closely full access and then you can set up all of your email campaigns you can set up all of these drify sort of LinkedIn automation campaigns but you can also combine them together into a really really cohesive prospecting strategy to get more clients for your business so lifetime deal again you pay that price once you're never going to have to pay it again so I'm using this within my0 to 10kk study to do the last episode where I get sort of the the $10,000 in cash collected so I wanted to recommend this if you want to get it access to it it's going to be Link in the description as well and finally we have Loom now this is a Nob brander for me Loom is a platform that's sort of a super simple to use Chrome extension on your browser and it's actually really great for creating video resources for your team or for your clients say how to set up your voice flow accounts during your handoff process you can film a video while it's on loom and you've always got that resource there and you can see that declined so creating video resources using loom that allows you to save time in future is a very very good way of using the software now getting into Service delivery we can start off with voice flow which is my go-to bot Builder um it is an extremely powerful tool that really just keeps getting better and better with time I've buil used a ton of different bot Builders and I still go back to this this is all we use basically within my agency morning side AI we can do very very complex Builds on voice flow um even my upcoming release of my new AI Liam inside my accelerator is actually built on voice flow so all of the functionality that's how good it is that we're even building our sort of Cutting Edge Tech off the back of voice flow so if you're not already using it as your Bot Builder i' highly recommend it and I'm going to continue to keep using it it's really the perfect mix between easy to use but also able to build really complex functionality so we can build a voice flow chatbot then we can connect it to some of more custom functionality that we create sort of custom coded and we can connect that into voice flow but the the chat experience the interface the deployment all of that is handed on The Voice plus side and makes our development process much more easy and at the end of the day makes it cheaper for clients to benefit from our solutions for you as an AI automation agency owner knowing how to create conversational assistance is like a a cheat code right now because it's the main interface by which AI technology can interact with business employees and clients so knowing how to build these chat Bots and conversational assistance is just an absolute must have and voice flow is my go-to platform for doing that and in terms of pricing voice flow has a 14-day free trial and a $49 per month after that on the sort of most basic plan next we have make.com now make.com is make goto automation platform to really connect up different parts of the business perform data manipulations and more importantly for us use the chat gbt API and open AI functionality within automations very easily so makers might goto over things like zapia due to it having sort of a deeper set of functionality so that you can continue to progress for a long time and continue to get better and better and really be a better automation developer on that side of things your creativity and build complexity is not capped by the platform with things like zapia has a lot more limitations but make I found has the right amount of depth for you to be able to really R and become a really really skilled developer on that side and the pricing for make is free initially and sort of scales with your usage and I will mention that the usage costs are very very affordable next we have relevance AI which is an AI application Builder and they they really try to keep it as low code and no cod as possible so drag and drop you can add things in and you can create these very very powerful AI applications not only for you to use personally internally in your in your team but also to build solutions for clients one of the things that really stuck out stuck out to me uh with relevance was the ability to create all this cool functionality and then export that to a a interface where your clients can then go in and interact with it and input data and then click a button and generates it so you can create these cool sort of custom web page applications for your clients which I think is a very very uh high value ad for clients but they also have cool features like bulk run so you can create an entire AI application and then you can run that thing that you've set up on every single row within a spreadsheet so say you have lead data and you want to run a classification script on it you can run 50,000 lines in a spreadsheet at once it's a really really cool functionality not only on being able to export functionality to a interface for your clients but also being able to do these bulk run processes as well the pricing for relevance is free initially and it does scale up and allow you to pay more as you use more next we have air table now air table is by far the easiest way to store and manage data for your clients it's something that I've gotten into more and more recently as you've seen probably from my recent videos but I really think it's a game changer when you combine it with things like voice flow or make or relevance all of the things I've just mentioned whenever you're doing your chat Bots and automation build it's a super easy place to be able to push and pull data programmatically and then do all sorts of cool things with that data once you have it inside air table so a lot of businesses are not tracking some of the data that they know they should be and air table is a great way for you to come in and create a new database for them and set up all sorts of cool automations off it and really build a lot of value without too much work on your end and air table thankfully also has a free plan available finally we get into some of the more personal software that I use myself that I would recommend to you as an agency owner to Max maximize your chance of success firstly we have brain FM now brain FM is a website that allows you to play music and audio that allows you to focus and keeps you locked in your focus it's scientifically designed to keep you focusing for longer periods of time now the truth is rookies listen to music while working it's been proven Time and Time Again by science that beats and Melodies they will hugely distract your brain when you're trying to focus so don't be a dummy and try to think that you're different or special or I'm a special sunflower or something you're not if you are serious about making money and staying focused and productive during the limited time you have available each day to get your work done you need to ditch music and run brain FM or or an alternative all day instead now this is something I've been using for coming up 3 years now but it's only in the past year that I've completely replaced music with brain FM so myself a bunch of my team members as well just constantly have brain FM running and this is the only kind of music I listen to while working fortunately it's only like $7 per month so I'd highly recommend if you're still listening to music you need to drop that stuff right now um and start checking out something like brain FM to use music to assist you in your focus BLX to get more work done next we have a software called rescue time now rescue time is a Time tracking and screen recording software that allows you to track the hours of productive work and distracting work that you do each day so it's a little bit creepy and that it records your whole screen and everything you're doing but for me it's a fair trade-off um because it's also going to be blocking websites that I've set myself to not go on during certain work hours and I've put this thing into practice over the past few months and I've actually been super happy with the impact that it's made on my FOC focus and really just awareness of how I'm working each day and where my time is going for many of you I'm sure you're like me at some point you go you get to the end of the day and you go like what have I what have I actually done like where did all that time go I can now go back to risky time and I can look and see how I've spent my time during the day okay I've spent a ton of time on Discord talking to people or you can analyze and break down how you're using your laptop and how you're using your computer during the workday and most importantly over time you're able to see the trends sort of daily Trends but also weekly Trends okay I did more work this week than I did last week really really helpful and a big change that I've made this year that's made a lot of difference in my awareness of how I'm using my time they link for you to try it out in the description there's two different options I personally use the analytics one on the right which is a lot more simple just tracking the time and giving you the analytics you can try the focus one but I haven't personally played around with that yet and a great part about rescue time is it only costs like $12 a month or something so no excuse really any the final software I want to mention is called Alami uh this finally is an alarm clock app that has enabled me to wake up on time basically every single day um I've ever wanted to Now alarm me is a is a alarm app that makes you set a whole bunch of different tasks so for me I have to click like four or five different like math questions and then I have to do 20 squats and then I have to do 20 steps now these kind of tasks it's not going to shut up until I do those tasks so if you're anything like me and waking up is tough on most mornings for you and it's not your favorite part of the day and really getting some consistency in your life that's going to translate over to business success I highly recommend getting an L M like Alami I hope that list of softwares has been helpful for you you if it has please hit

is going to be for automating things with AI and all the smbs that will not have the skill set to do it and it's just like okay it's very clear there's going to be a large Services layer in the middle people say oh but they wouldn't pay that for a chat bot it's just a chat bot it's just a this based on conversations like this it becomes clear that we need to reframe it a little bit as to how we look at chat Bo open's goal is not to be a tool Builder they're not making money from the tools they're making money from the consumption and they're making money from having the best models that's a trillion dollar market AI automation's blown up we're just seeing like the proliferation of people realizing that the ROI statement that we've all been used to for the past 10 years has completely flipped and it starts to get you thinking what's the interface even going to look like our websites obsolete now what's going on guys this is an interview between myself and Braden reene the CEO of voice flow I really wanted to get him on the channel to discuss some of the big events and updates within the space regarding the future of chatbot Builders and the future of AI automation agencies in light of these new updates with open AI I had an absolute blast in this conversation with them so I know that there's going to be a ton of value in here for you not only in the direction of the space and where he sees it going but some of the perspective shifts that are required to to properly see the opportunity for what it is I highly recommend you watch the entire video because there's so much good stuff packed into this on the main channel here there's only going to be about half of it with the rest of the the full interview being put on the morning side AI channel so if you want to get to the end of the video and you think you want to see the rest it's going to be linked in the first link in the description we can go over to the morning side AI Channel where I do my proper long form conversations with different people okay welcome everybody to the channel we have a very special guest today Braden ream the CEO of voice flow I've been going back and forth Braden and the team um trying to get this interview because I know there's a lot of stuff going on in the space right now that people are dying to hear my thoughts on but more importantly I thought I get it from the horse's mouth um as someone who's leading a company in the space and something that myself and and my community use heavily is to get Bren on here and give his thoughts on what happened with the assistance API the gbts update and how this affects the space moving forward so Braden firstly welcome um it's it's a pleasure to have you on the channel and uh looking forward to hearing what you have to say yeah excited to be here uh it's been a crazy couple of months and so it be a lot of fun to chat about all that today awesome well we just jump straight into it and go roll back what two two and a bit weeks now um the gpts r update rolled out the D Day announcements um all hell broke loose it seemed um what's your take on the recent updates and I think specifically if we can start with the the trend towards uh autonomous agents and instead of human input we're going seem to AI is leading us a little bit more towards a future where it's not necessarily human input but more uh sort of agent to agent communication where do you think uh voice flow fits into this kind of industry and space moving forward totally so I think you know before I even talk about voice flow um I'll talk a little bit about sort of the history of assistance uh because I think it it plays into this nicely so um when we got into this space in like 2018 2019 it was Alexa that was all the rage you know that was sort of the big dominant consumer assistant and I don't think a lot of people paid attention to how Alexa was trying to build their ecosystem but what they were trying to build is Alexa skills and Alexa skills were essentially um thirdparty apps you could build on top of Alexa and what was really interesting is Alexa in the same way that uh opening ey gpts now is trying to uh connect these different thirdparty apps had the same thing skills connections and they really laid out the model for having a consumer assistant that would be like an Alexa that is essentially a browser for the internet of assistant out there the internet of agents and what's interesting is over time uh you know you would interact with your consumer assistant who could then access you know the business assistant right so maybe I wanted to uh book a hotel with Expedia or something like that today you would go through Alexa and again I'm using Alexa but you could you know swap in chat gbt or really any assistant you could talk to ch gbt then talk to Alexa and book a hotel or sorry talk to Expedia book a hotel what really starts to become interesting is that's just one task like let's say you want to go to Paris or something you need a hotel you need flights you need like a bunch of different Services when can these agents and assistants start to do compound tasks when they can start to decide what do I need in order to actually fulfill this entire this entire journey and I think that's where um Alexa skills was trying to go and that's now where sort of the successor with uh gpts is is now really heading in that direction and even plugins earlier uh this year you know it looked like it was going to be it right yeah totally I mean you know we had this we had a lot of this similar conversations when plugins came out um earlier this year that we're now having about gbts and it's just really cool because we're now moving towards um this sort of Internet of agents and I think you're going to see essentially every business will have an agent and every uh consumer will have a consumer assistant that they trust right and so I think over time you're going to start to see um people are going to choose you know maybe they use Alexa as their shopping Focus agent maybe it's Siri which is going to be their privacy focused agent maybe it's going to be chat gbt which is you know the all-encompassing super smart agent and it' be really interesting because you sort have these consumer agents that then interface with the business agents so I think that's you know if we go the at the highest level that's sort of the macro um when it comes to uh some of the announcements that came out with uh the gpts my opinion is that um open AI is trying to build the best models they're trying to get the AGI and in order to do that you need um the best data and so what they've done is they they're trying to turn a model advantage that uh I think this year what we've seen is like the model advantages are more fleeting than we initially thought like companies are catching up within months right and so um they're launching these models and then now they're trying to turn that short-lived model Advantage into like a distribution advantage that can then lead to better data so they launched uh gpts which allows you to do these like specialized use cases on top which then allows them to get uh a distribution Moe because now like chat gbt is becoming useful not just for the model but for the application layer on top of it um and also it's giving them a way better Specialized data because now it's not just chat gbt that's like very broad you know the conversation's not labeled it's very specifically uh you know a lead gen uh GPT it's very specifically an accounting GPT so that data is better than for them to be able to use because it's it's more filtered right the better quality data the better quality models you get and so the way that we view it is open ai's goal is to get better data to eventually get the AGI to build you know to build better models and this is just a great way to create a distribution mode to make sure that they continue to get more data that chat gbt continues to be the place that we all interact with and um that the gpts give them uh higher quality more sort ofine tune data now how do you do that imagine you're opening eye for a second you have to create tools that make it easy for people to actually Kickstart that process um and I don't know if we want to go too deep here but every we can go deep yeah yeah so every product follows this like fundamental law which is you can either be easy or powerful and the reason why that is is because every feature you add like you know for all the chatbot Builders uh sort of watching every time you add an additional widget or button or you know some sort of capability it makes the chatbot more powerful but it also makes it a little bit harder to use right the easiest chatbot would be something that is um so you know just button- driven right really simple two or three flows um you know it doesn't do much but it's bulletproof um same thing with product design so we think about this at voice flow a lot every button we add gets more more and more powerful right every feature every whatever whatever uh we add the problem is as you do that it becomes way more complex and hard to use and so like let's say website builders for example do you want to be Wix or do you want to be webflow or WordPress they all fall in this like spectrum of easy to use to hard to use hard to use typically skews to more value um it's a more powerful platform typically like mid-market uh Enterprise really you know uh skilled agencies who then service those larger customers or skilled agencies who Service uh maybe an SB based that wants more than just like a Wix website so when we think about what open AI wants to do they want data right to build the best models so they're going to build tools that enable the widest audience of people which means the tools are going to be pretty simple um I think over time as they need to uh get better data they might make the tools more complex but they risk if they make the tools too complex they risk sort of having the broadest top of funnel right because if you make a a builder so easy that everyone can build a TPT yes the build might not be very happy but opening ey's goal is not to be a uh a tool Builder they're not making money from the tools they're making money from the consumption and they're making money from having the best models that's a trillion dollar market they don't care about the tool Market which is much smaller and so the tools are just there as a way to facilitate um the outcome But ultimately I think the like sort of the power and complexity they're going to leave to third party tools like a voice flow for example um because we're just going after a smaller market in terms of the number of people out there higher value you know more complex and things like that but their Market way bigger and they're just trying to get the data so um that's kind of how we think about it you know it comes at it from a couple different lenses there um hope I'm glad you said that because I've literally it's it's so good to hear it from another person especially someone in your position because am I someone in my comment section and said uh like what's the I don't know there was a couple different ones one was um why wouldn't what's the point of building on these platforms anymore wouldn't open AI just roll out the own feature for themselves and aren't they one step away from creating a chat Builder and all this kind of stuff and my take was was exactly that which is that's not the that's the pennies game they're in the the big money is in the foundational models and in the building the the API that everything runs on for them if if you think put yourself in the position of samman or whoever now samman again but would you be bending down to pick up the relative pennies in the market which are still massive markets but relative to the the foundational models side of things it's just not if you had limited resources you wouldn't be allocating it to oh but there's a little bit of money there make a Instagram WhatsApp and telegram deployer straight out of a like it just doesn't make sense for them they can focus on what they're good at rather than getting their hands Tangled into and I'm sure you know as soon as you get into uh interfaces and things like this it's just a completely different ball game so if they could stick to their their back end work their their apis I'm sure that's where they' they'd much rather be sitting I mean they're A90 billion company vo is a100 million doll company um and like you know they're growing like bananas um and you know if we actually take this down to the the tangible voice flow is not easy to use right like relative to uh how easy it could be right you know you come in you know we could we could strip out a ton of the complexity but then you lose a lot of that power so if they were to build what voice flow has they can for for example they could do some of the business logic stuff for sure and some of the Integrations um but then you start to alienate the audience and then what's interesting is then other third party tools that make it easier will pop up right and so they have to think about do they want to be the biggest widest most Mass Market or do they want to be uh the biggest most complex and I think um so boy flow has what anthropic models open a ey models and we got other models uh coming um they're still getting data and consumption from supporting third party tools and so we've got a great partnership with them where or you know maybe not a formal partnership we got a good relationship I should say um and we're still bringing them great big Enterprises who are now using vo those more complex tools and feeding that data through to open AI so they kind of win both markets by uh exposing these apis but then enabling people who can't use the more complex more powerful tools with really easy simple tools they actually kind of capture both sides of the market yeah and I think the the interface is a interface side of the whole equation is a very interesting one and it's one that you guys have made a bit of a pivot recently on away from necessarily having WhatsApp and these different deployments down to just the voice and the chat deployments essentially so what is your thoughts on on the future of interfaces and this this big question mark that is in the in the sort of software 3.0 stack as I believe what some people call it where do you see the interface going uh for for AI based applications and how is voice flow uh tailoring its its strategy if you want to go into strategy but how we can expect you guys to play this moving forward totally I mean there's so much Innovation like I think the interfaces is um there's going to be so much change over the next year on the interface side that our approach was actually to pull back and just focus on what we're really really good at which is the building experience and then expose an API and allow others to build their own interface so we have our web chat widget which is essentially the one channel that we're going to uh natively support really really well and then everything else is going to be done through an API and the reason for this is we had customers com and say hey I'm doing an automated drive-thru and I need like a face right can you guys build an interface for that uh I'm doing a SMS integration with this provider I'm doing uh WhatsApp I'm doing like you know in I'm doing all these different interfaces especially the custom interfaces there's a lot of those and we started to realize that um we're not going to be the company to build out those interfaces you know we've got 200,000 users now like how do we enable our users to be able to build interfaces for each other to make it really easy to build their own interfaces customize these interfaces because I think um you know a really interesting Trend I've seen is you go to a website and you know when the web chat widget first launched as sort of like a paradigm I don't know like five six seven years ago um the Bots were not very powerful ful and so you would you know use the website then you use the widget for a little bit then you go back to the website the Bots are now getting so good that we've seen where like you click on the you know you click on the widget and it just goes full screen because there's no point in even using the website anymore and it starts to get you thinking like what what's the interface even going to look like like is web are websites obsolete now um as a paradigm because like I'm not even using the website I'm just using the chatbot and so you start to think well hold up like if the chatbot can start to give you know more detailed responses will when you land on a website page in future is it just going to be a chat bot and it will serve you the website elements as needed right and as you have a conversation with this website and so I think like that kind of interface uh Innovation is going to be so fast and Rapid that like we're going to let the community figure out how they want to do that and then just try to support it as best we can um so that's sort of the approach right now and then in future you can expect us to add more what we would call like direct Channel Integrations again so whether that's Instagram or Whatsapp but we just really want to focus on like enabling the community to innovate right now um and then over time I think we'll start to add more and more like native Channel Integrations it's funny you mention that as well because I was having a chat with my uh my template team on the the accelerator and had the same conversation I was just like racking my brain like where does this where does the interface go like how does this where does where does this all lead and what ises the interface of the future look like and how we interact with these assistants and Abby one of our one of our developers in there who was saying when like I I think the the interface becomes becomes chat in many ways and it does like you were saying make make the website in in many aspects obsolete because with the the ability to call functions throughout it as we saw with the DFD demo is that being able to converse with the assistant and be able to do things that you normally have to do by clicking around it's as I've said in Prior videos it's the end of this this point and click websites and it's trans sort of transforming over to a a conversational based interface but I think it's also important and a good an important reframe to make for people who are working in the space is that chat bots in the way that we know them have a have a basic and and sort of mundane and dull sound to them in many ways but yet we have it is literally the interface of the future at least before we get to the voice side of things I think it's been difficult pill for some people to swallow um it's something that I've been kind of having to push our pill along my journey is that people say oh but they wouldn't pay that for a chat bot it's just a chat bot it's just a this and based on conversations like this becomes clear that we need to reframe it a little bit as to how we look at chatbots it's not just a chatbot it's a it's a the new new way of interacting with technology in any ways so I'm glad to hear you you've got the same thoughts on that it is very exciting the thought of we've even considered to put it on our um on my on my accelerator website where it's okay you come on instead of having to read through the whole page people have questions that come to their mind as soon as they get to the page have to make them pick through the entire website to try to find it why not just ask the question and we can we can give you the answer and we can serve you up resources and links and everything that you need and I think the assistance API has been a big step towards that with the knowledge based component and the tools so I love the idea of reframing what a chat bot is um you know this is something when we were raising money for voice flow we had the same thing from investors you know who cares about chat Bots and you know the way that we frame this to folks is you know when you think about a chat bot you just think about like the chat bubble but it's so much more than that if you if you roll it back and you start to think about every single interaction that you have with a customer is a part of a conversation so when I'm on Netflix and I'm trying to choose a movie to watch and you know it's I've been scrolling for two minutes now that's me like you know in the most abstract way saying hey hey Netflix I can't find what I want can you jump in here and suggest something right like that was an implicit act in a conversation Netflix then jumps in over time you know uh I need to add another subscription I need to you know chat with them over text like all the different channels all the different interfaces all the different both implicit and explicit actions s to blend to uh chatbots essentially being like the CRM like the relationship operating system between uh the customer and your business and yeah and and like I think when people start to frame it that way that it is um the chat bubbles is the interface that people think about what people think that the interface is the product but the product is the agent the product is like that behind the scenes tracking all different interactions with all your customers and done really well it can be just an awesome experience uh like what if ever had it where you know you call an ivr and uh like a you know like a contact center and it already knows what you know it already knows what you're calling about you know because it looked up your number it saw you know who you are as a customer it saw that you purchased something last week like when you have experiences like that where again it feels like wow like this is not just some call center bot there's some intelligence behind the scenes like they have an agent there um that's when like the experiences get really magical people need to start thinking about disambiguating the interface that you see and the behind the scenes logic that is the operating system between how your business interacts with customers for sure I'm I'm very big on this this data side of things I think the the conversational a conversation as a channel via whatever the you want to use there's something special about being able to to pull information out of those conversations because you get to see into the customers world and life in a way that you don't really get to when they're just interacting with your website because they don't think that those conversations are being mon like it's not top of mind when you're asking something to a web chat widget about a product or about you're not thinking that this is going to be dug over and analyzed over time for for information and especially when it comes down to those more personal ones where it's not so much just customer support but it's actually like how can I help and it's getting very very personal with that and feedback as well there's there's so much to be minded out of this and I was looking up a good conversational data you might know something something like this but a like industrial scale or like business scale conversational data analytics that uh you can plug into something like these these assistants now as you're pumping out all these threads there needs to be a way I've just done a video on the channel um covering how you can export these threads and then analyze them um using air table to make it's nothing nothing too fancy but there's going to be massive need for okay I've got all these threads that have just been created over the past week where can I plug them in and get some insights out of it so do you know if there's any conversational data analytics platforms out there or or what do you guys use internally for that if you're allowed to say yeah I mean we um we've got some features and boic that aren't publicly available that do stuff like this and I'll maybe I'll show you after the recording um but I think a lot of people when they think about chat Bots again they're thinking on like the very first level which is like I see the chat Bubbles and I see it just for one particular use case like let's take lead gen but um I think what gets really interesting and I think this is for a lot of the um agency owners the very first step when you start working with a client and we're trying to do this more rigorously ourselves as well is let's analyze the data that you have let's analyze the transcript data like where is the opportunity for automation because you might think it's leg gen but it might be some internal uh task automation right and so for example you know we were chatting with a company the other day where um they had a bunch of uh I think they have like 600 cold call uh agents uh and what they need was uh lead enrichment and that was it like they just needed to be able to say hey I'm going to call this person run it through a chat bot that says hey I just pulled up older data here's like the best way to approach this cold call script M that by 600 and then like people 50 calls a day like 100 calls a day totally factoring the time of day factoring any potential holidays like and you start to realize that for that it's a very bespoke use case right leave lead jet is what I would consider um a very high volume high impact use case but where there's a lot of opportunity is um there's a thousand small little use cases at most businesses like you know we have use cases that only exist at Voice Low right things that you know only we uniquely need and how can we um work with companies that are automating not just like the core pillars everyone knows customer support everyone knows customer experience how can we start automating a lot of those bespoke um like mid mid volume low volume use cases that have high impact right so like we're starting to think a lot about this now is voo not just being a way to um you know automate customer support but it's like customer support's just the beginning once you're in you know once you've landed with a customer how do you then automate everything else right and really thing about like that AI automation piece which is why like I love sort of where um your s and others like are taking the space um because that's totally what it is it's AI automation but everyone needs everyone's focusing on the same use cases there's so many long use cases that provide a ton of value um and I think folks aren't necessarily thinking about it that way yeah I think that that comes down to me quite a bit I think I do try to at least in most of my content to make it as beginner friendly as possible and it does in order to attack those Niche use cases and the the business specific ones that gets a bit closer to a custom solution and in my experience you need a a fairly deep and and and Broad skill set as well in order to be able to piece together a solution for that so that includes like the automation platforms the chat Builders the the backend sort of more complex knowledge based functionality that you need so the I feel like the pillars are a good point for people to get into like a customer support leion and all these kind of areas where it's easy and and they understand it and there's places you can get templates like I've put lead generation templates and these kind of things out that are fairly easily attackable but that is the definitely the destination that we want to get a lot of the agency owners in the community to which is being able to come in there and and take a full sort of head to toe look at the business and identify those combination of of high impact and and low cost to deliver as well so it's it's ideally it's not ridiculously hard for you to build at the same time which is that sweet spot between valuable yet not too hard to deliver totally right like it's um and we think about this the exact same way um we have pillar use cases like you know our sales and marketing team very focused on customer support customer experience Automation in app co-pilots like you know sort of like the pillar use cases that people know about but what we're starting to do with uh our larger customers to say hey um if you're comfortable with it give us your call transcript data and let's see um you know you can do methods like utterance clustering let's look at the 10,000 utterances and let's cluster them into groups and you might realize hey there's actually this whole group of automation that's not even being touched right let's start looking at internal opportunities internal conversations um like conversational uh Analytics it's going to be a really big area for sure like um now that you can kind of automate everything like if you look at the history of chatbots over the past like you know 10 years in so of these know kind of came onto the scene in 2014 um chots were so expensive to build before llms that customer support was the only use case that even made sense from an Roi standpoint that was it it was like big companies had maybe their own custom teams like we work with a lot of big companies who you know they spend you know there you can go find some reports online $100 million building their chat bot is was a very big Bank in America that was how much they spent send my way next time they come around can deliver something there discount it's it's crazy so you see like a price tag like that I can tell you like from working with some of these teams there's hundreds of people like hundreds building these these Bots and a lot of them were built on the nlu Paradigm where that was what was required now with large language models you can have a two to three person agency stand something up that's like pretty comparable um and that's what's now leading to this explosion of like smbs uh you know midm markets being like hey like I don't need to have a $100 million budget to put together an assistant I can now do this with a very small team and that's what's been really exciting because it's now unlocking all these other use cases as well where again customer support was the only thing that had an Roi that made sense now it's like hold up if I can actually enable that you know 600 person call group you know and it's not going to cost me a million dollars to put that bot together that Roi is now actually worth it I'm going to go do it um and so I think we're just seeing like and I think it's like um the AI automation blown up we're just seeing like the proliferation of people realizing that the ROI statement that we've all been used to for the past 10 years has completely flipped everything is now for the most part like Roi positive as long as you have the right tools and skill set sure I think it'd be good to to also discuss what you've see to be as the the tech stack moving forward and how voice fits into that and yes we have the assistance API which is going to be running a lot of things we have some token costs that I want to talk to you about in a second about and the sort of usability of that in its current state but there's things like the assistance API there's voice flow and there's obviously the the major component of this which is tooling how do you see that sort of ecosystem tying together and how people can play into that and and build sort of solutions uh using your software yeah so how we think about voice flow is largely as an orchestration uh framework and so um how do you orchestrate multiple different models multiple different gpts um we're of the belief that uh if you want to build complex multi-turn um agents that are you know um reliably able to automate not just knowledge but tasks right because we sort of at voice how the internal framework we use is there's knowledge automation that's like your knowledge based Q&A like that's sort of that kind of stuff and then um there's the task automation how do we actually do refunds you know uh TI you know collect emails like that kind of stuff integration yeah essentially integration heavy stuff um we're very focused on okay cool you have you're gonna have gpts which are going to do a lot of the knowledge uh automation I think over time they'll get into some of the simple Integrations do we think open AI is going to be the only player in the space no so how do we be like the model agnostic orchestration framework that's really collaborative really powerful can scale all the way up from like you know a really uh Advanced agency all the way to the world's largest companies you know we have a bunch of features coming for scale soon um and that's how we're thinking about ourselves uh agnostic uh all theit orchestrating the different components because we don't think that for example let's say someone Builds an awesome GPT to do uh you know function a that's great have that like orchestrate with voice flow we've been showing off a lot of those types of capabilities recently and even as the gpts start to talk to each other we think that the ecosystem is going to be large enough where it'll never just be fully contained with open Ai and if it is that's totally cool at the end of the day we're just going to help customers build the best experiences but we believe in a world that's going to be a multimodel so there's gon to be a lot of different models out there you're going to want to keep uh some of your Integrations not just entirely with a no open AI you might want to have a third-party Integrations framework which is actually uh maybe you know hosted on a private cloud or whatever it might be um that's kind of how we're thinking about voice flow from from the long run um scalability extensibility um and then ultimately just trying to be agnostic to all the underlying models yeah I think we're on the same page there with just started work on our I'll probably have chat to you and Daniel about it a bit more and to get your thoughts on it but we are sort of rolling out our model agnostic platform that's going to help people to a lot of the agency owners to hook into platforms like voice flow and so it's sort of a little intermediary step between open Ai and and voice flow that's going to allow people to connect into it very easily and I'm super excited to get more information on about that but the uh I think we've seen with this open AI episode which turned our lives upside down I'm sure well it did for me I can only imagine for you with with the company you have on your hands um how much this past the past week must have felt but the the need for diversification away from why model provider has been really highlighted here for the past couple of days until Sam mman announced the the return I was thinking okay does this mean we've got if they're they're reallocating all their resources to be a research company again this means the assistance API is not going to get the development of needs it's it's still too slow it's still too expensive in many ways they haven't done memory management ET there's so much that needs to be done there but it was so promising it was really concerning like are we going to have to set and and TT thumbs here for 6 months until another company picks up the slack but thankfully we've now got them back on the scene however however that's that's going to play out but anord coming in with CLA 2.1 with tools I think is a very good sign for for what is to come and allowing us to be not so riant on just one provider so you said you have allowed and clawed support recently yeah yes yes we've got anthropic support uh all the open AI models actually I think I think we haven't launched turbo just yet but uh for gbd4 um yeah and anthropic um open a and then uh we've got plans to add a lot more models as well as custom models as well because we you know we work with some big Enterprises where they're just building their own stuff their own large language models uh and I think also with all the open source large language models uh coming out now it's I I think it's more likely than not that you have open AI remains kind of like the dominant close Source player and then you're gonna have just a slew especially on the big company side of like open source models um because it allows you control your data uh you know you don't have to worry about Cloud outage and things it's all in your Cloud it'll be really interesting to see how how much it fragments MH yeah I think tooling is going to be for for agency owners and people looking to make money in the space is to sort of ride the back of the stuff that's coming out what is your thoughts on uh tooling and the importance of knowing how to build their moving on because I feel like that out of the what I call like three ingredients out of these gbts and assistance you prompting knowledge and tooling any any idiot can do the the first two but being able to create custom tools that are powerful and specialized to a certain use case or adapted to a business I see is as what's going to be the biggest value add for someone who's looking to get into the space to make money how do you see the uh the tool creation environment continuing to develop and and the importance of it moving forward totally I actually want to answer this from a different angle and then I'll come back what I want to address is you know maybe a month ago there was uh I saw a whole bunch of videos it was like you know the the a AI AA model it's dead right all this kind of stuff you know I haven't made money um and I'll tie it back in why this is relevant in a sec but I thought it was such a like a ridiculous thing for this reason of think about how many like smbs have websites think about how many smbs um you know like it's it's you know and all of these smbs cannot use or it's really difficult to use AI uh today and so the way I view it is there's going to be a a massive Services layer in the middle I mean look at how deoe and all these like large consultancies are pushing into AI they're setting up practices or hiring You Know Chief AI officers and all this kind of stuff it's because if you do not have the skill set to stand stuff up that's the services layer in the middle right and so how we think about is Voice Low focus on building the best tools you're G to have all these smbs midm markets out there who do not have internal resources and it does not make sense for them to learn you know how to use voice loads we you know we use a website contractor because we don't have the time to use uh learn to use web flow to the degree we we need right it just doesn't make sense to hire a fulltime convenience and expertise you'll pay for it every time totally and so um I just think about how big the market is going to be for automating things with AI and all the smbs that will not have the skill set to do it and it's just like okay it's very clear there's going to be a large Services layer in the middle like that's just like it feels you look at the website market and I think AI is going to be wor impactful than websites you know because I think we're talking about not only uh the replacement of the interface which we've already kind of talked about but also the replacement of a lot of internal task so it's like the RPA market and the interface Market had like this you know this this yeah trying to find a good word but yes um and so anyways I I'm extremely bullish for that reason of like there's it just makes all the sense in the world so going back to how are good people uh people going to make money I think people are going to make money setting up um a gencies and I think when people think about agencies uh you know I mean you've got a ton of great resources on this but like choosing a use case for sure like building up like building up an expertise and overtime branching out to tental use cases that's awesome because I think um customers and smbs don't search for AI automation agency they search for lead gen automation you know I mean they search for the use case you just happen to be the model and so I think some people have got that you know kind of backwards thinking that people are searching for the agency name yeah no one outside the space knows what AI automation the agency is no no business owner is searching that up totally like we don't you know we're not trying to optimize SEO for like uh you know like collaborative chatbot Builder we're Auto you know we're doing like customer support automation because people are searching for the use case that the tool solves for so that you know that's sort of the first thing so agencies with use cases then I think you're G to have that's all for the video here on the main channel the rest of it is going to be in its uncut full link

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you how to automatically export and analyze conversations from your custom gpts across channels like web chat widgets WhatsApp Instagram and more this has been a highly requested video because many of you have started deploying your custom gpts to these channels but once a way to track and analyze interactions with your users the truth is these conversational channels can be insanely powerful for businesses but without properly storing and analyzing this data you are losing half of the value of your gpts as this data can contain valuable information for use in future decision- making by the end of this video you'll not only know how to automate the exporting of transcripts from your custom GPT deployments but you'll also get access to my complete automation template for analyzing and extracting valuable data from them with the help of AI adding huge value to your GPT powered Solutions if you don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development company Morningside Ai and run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just just like the system you're about to build let's get into it firstly we need a quick explainer of this build and how this system works this is going to be using the assistant API which you may be familiar from my other videos but we are creating these custom gpts that we can put onto our our WhatsApp Channel onto our website Etc but we're going to be calling that same API but this time in a different way that allows us to request and and pull all of the transcripts and messages from the interactions that our users have had with the API open AI allows us to get that information at any time we want but you need to know how to request that information from the API which is what we're going to be covering firstly in this video in this particular video we are going to be building on top of all of the work I've done in my prior videos such as my WhatsApp and Instagram deployments so in order to fully understand this and and how it's all working uh you need to watch one of those videos up here I'll put the Instagram one up so you can see that essentially we're going to be using that same system adding a little bit in that allows us to export the transcripts and then showing you the air table setup that we're using and also the make automations the way this works is that every time a conversation is started on our website on WhatsApp on Instagram wherever it is every time a conversation is started we are going to be saving what's called a thread ID and every time the conversation starts we generate a thread ID and in my prior builds we hadn't been doing anything with that thread ID apart from using it in the conversation but in this case we are going to be saving that thread ID to an air table and then we're going to be taking that thread ID and looking up all of the messages within that thread ID pulling them all out packaging them up analyzing them and then putting them all into a nice database and spreadsheet for us to look at and analyze later as always with my videos everything that you see here is going to be available for free on my resource Hub in the description so you can get the air table template which is the database you have the make automation template which is a a very complex one that I've created for you guys to all use and plug in and get started with immediately then we have a repet template and also a mini chat template so it's all templated you guys are going to get access to all of it and I'll walk you through how to use it now to get started you need to clone my ripple which is available on my resource Hub as I mentioned there'll be a link there that you can click and it'll open up this page and you'll be able to click this Fork button in the top right and that'll take you to a page that looks a bit like this once it's all booted up again as I mentioned in order to understand what's going on here you do need to watch the Instagram deployment the video which I will now Link in the description as well so watch that and come back and a lot of this will make a lot more sense and I'm going to scam over a few things like the API keys that I did Cover in depth on those videos as well but this particular Builder is is just a basic custom knowledge chatbot I have removed all of the tooling from this so all it is using is a knowledge based document with information about my AAA accelerator program so I've given it information on that and point of this chat bot is going to be able to ask questions about the pricing and the features and things like this now you won't necessarily see me using it in this because I've already created some transcripts for us to use later in the video but I'll give you a quick walkthrough of things here and how this is different from my prior videos and how this is going to allow us to export the transcripts so that we can analyze them and and manage them as well and the functions. P file is the main difference here which is this add thread function and this is interacting with an air table base that I've created that stores all of the threads which we get to in a sec aside from that we have this create assistant function here so if you want to modify this and change the knowledge base you can delete your knowledge base on the on the left this knowledge document and upload a new one and then you can change the name of the document here as I've done in my prior videos there is no tooling here all it is is a custom knowledge base there's no lead capture there's nothing the point of this is just to show you how you can export the thread IDs and then pull that information from there in a second and our main. PI file is another key difference here from my other videos and that's in this start route when we're calling to start the conversation as a mentioned we're going to start the conversation and then when we generate that thread ID we need to send that thread ID to our air table and save that to access it later and pull the information from and here is where we are calling the ad thread function to send that information to our air table in this start conversation function there is one other difference which is this platform argument that we're going to be including say if I deploy this application and I want to use it on messenger and I want to use it on WhatsApp we can actually specify on the many chat side of things which you'll see in a second we can specify which platform we are calling this this start conversation from so we are able to see in our air table where these conversations and where these threads are coming from if you are following along and want to copy this and get it working on your end then you do need to change these two Secrets up here I've gone over how to get your open AI key before and how to get your air table API key as well as mentioned I have covered that in my WhatsApp and Instagram videos jumping into our air table now you are going to be able to clone this entire base it'll be in the resource Hub as well there'll be a button when you click on the link that'll be up in this top corner you can click on that and it allows you clone the entire thing and start to make edits once you've cloned the air table base you need to do one thing in order to make this work on the repet side which is go over to the top right and you can do your API Keys as you do this as well and you can click on the web API documentation and if you go down to the Smith solar CRM if you scroll down to the threads table and if we go to create a record it will get this URL here that says threads at the end oh I need to get the whole thing copy that and then we can head back to our functions. piy and you need to delete this which will be my one and paste in yours and that will make sure that it's trying to send to yours and not mine you'll see there's a couple other tabs up here these are just from the other projects I like to just keep them all in one so I don't have 50 different air table bases for all these different videos but the only ones we worried about in this case is going to be the threads and the overview one in the threads table here I'll give you a quick orientation here are the thread IDs that are sent from our application when we call this uh add thread function we're passing the thread and the platform and that is being saved into our air table here we have the thread and then we have the platform as a nice little drop down select here air table is also automatically filling the created at field and then we have the real data that we're trying to extract out of these thread IDs which is the transcript and the topic and in this case I've added a status column and a date one as well so the status can be processed arrived or empty which I'll go into in a second and the date refers to what's in the overview here where you can get a high level overview of what kind of volume is coming through what kind of questions are being asked Etc on the left panel here I've made a few different views that allows us to switch between them on the screen I have this ready to process view which is basically anything that hasn't yet gone through our automation system to pull the transcripts out and label them and classify them and everything which you'll see in a second these are basically waiting to be processed hence the ready to process name then we have the processed ones what will appear here are all the transcripts that have already gone through our automation system come back and they've been labeled they've got the full transcript Etc and then here's an empty one cuz sometimes you get empty threads we want to keep them out of the data set and then you can see all threads here as well for these thread IDs to actually be getting created and sent off we of course need to call it within our application that's actually sending these messages and in this case we're using mini chat like with my other tutorials so the difference here between my other ones is that in this case we needing to go on this create thread and here I've added this question mark platform equals Instagram so in this case it's sending a a get parameter we're sending a a little bit of information attached to the URL and if you go back to our main.py file that is where we are expecting it here so it's from the request it's getting the platform key and it's saving it to platform and then we are sending off platform to our add thread function which is adding it and it goes back to air table and make sure that we're getting the right value in the platform column it's a little bit complex cuz there three different things going on here but basically whenever a conversation starts on WhatsApp or Instagram we're going to be sending off the name of the platform so that we can log it in our air table as well aside from that everything in here is the same as my other videos so I've gone off screen and I've gone through the conversation you can click the preview button up here and if you click the preview button I can copy this and send it to myself on Instagram and I've had a bunch of conversations and these have all been logged to air table already by using this function which is being called every time they start and so that is what you are seeing here which are all of the thread IDs from the conversations I've had are waiting to head our automation system so that they can get all the transcripts pulled which we getting into now we now need to call the assistant API and request the information that's inside that thread and process it and send it back to air table for that we'll be using make.com which is probably my favorite automation platform and luckily for you I've already created an entire template to make this as easy as possible for you so what you'll need to do to get that template as go on my resource Hub of course there'll be a link to sign up to make.com if you haven't already and there'll also be a link to download download the template and then you can come back to the screen ready to create your first scenario now on the top right we can click create a new scenario and then with that file that you downloaded you can click the more button on the bottom and click import blueprint choose the file and choose the blueprint here and then save it and Bam you get all of this work that I've done today which is going to completely automate the whole process now I've tested this pretty heavily it is working very well for me right now to get this working on your end it's a very easy setup we've just got to do a little bit with API keys and then we can get it running first thing you need to do to get this started is to click on the search records node here and you need to add a new connection mine's already set up but it won't be for you on the connection type you can click on air table token or key and then we need to give it a name this I'll call tutorial 2 and then we need to go back over to air table and create an API key if you haven't already so if you've already set this up and you know what to do you'll probably already have an air table API key that you use within repet and then so you can take that same one over and use it within make as well but for those you who haven't got one yet we can click on the developer Hub up here go to the personal access tokens on the left click create new token tutorial 2 now with the Scopes here I've had issues with these so I recommend just go all out here it seems be one of them that caused the issue and I think it is this weo manage one make sure you've added all of these Scopes because if you miss one of them then it's not going to allow you to make the connection over on make so once you click confirm you'll be able to copy your API key hit back over to make and then you can scroll down and paste it into here and then click save and it's going to have created a new connection for you here in make that you need to set up on all of the other ones as well so all of this should have pre-filled but if it hasn't for you then you need to copy the exact settings here of the base being Smith solar CRM the threads table the view of being ready to process and the only output field we're interested in is the thread ID the limit is 100 also then we need to do the same things on the rest of the air table nodes so we can click here make sure you're using your connection and these are the settings here if you need to pause it and take a look and then finally we have the update record here and the these are the settings you need to copy here so Smith solo CRM threads we're pulling the record ID which should have already populated we have the all messages the topics these map toggles are turned on for these and we also have Smart links as true so make sure that you have that on as well before I run it I should probably give you a quick breakdown of what's actually going on here so you're not completely blind but what we're doing is searching for records and air table that are on that ready to be processed uh view the ready to process view is Handy like that because we can keep it as a a storage or a holding area for all of these transcripts that have come in over theast last day or so as our people have interacted with our with our gpts and they all land here waiting to be processed and then we can just fire at once fire the automation once on a scheduling which I'll show you in a second and then when we fire that it's going to run through all of these and run the processes needed to pull that in analyze the transcript and fill out these fields once we have pulled all of those records in from the ready to process table then we need to aggregate them all into an array which you don't need to worry about too much then we're basically going to Loop through all of the different records so we might get 50 different records that have come in in one batch then we need to Loop through each of them which is done with this iterator here and everything that follows after this it needs to go through all here and then loop back over for each one so one record loop back over two record so it goes over and over and over again on every different record by pulling the thread ID and and doing these next steps with the thread ID that we've pulled in from that specific row we then call the open AI API that allows us to get the information from these threads and we inserting the thread ID from that row into this get URL here and actually I've just noticed one other thing you do need to change uh you need to add in your own API key here so this is your open AI API key so you can go get that from your open AI account and come down here and just replace this keeping the bearer and the space that's going to allow you to call and ask for the information back and it's going to allow you to be authenticated to do that what this does is pulls back all of the messages out of the thread then we process that data or bit if there's no messages in the thread then we go to this one which is basically going to say okay this is an empty thread and label it as empty but if there are messages then we're going to Loop through all of the different messages that came in and smos all of them together into one one big long piece of text saying user said this assistant said this back and forth and then we send it off to a chat GPT node in which I've written this prompt that says it is a transcript analyzer and I've given it a couple different labels you guys can have a look through this in your own time basically in my use case where this GPT has been an assistant helping people learn more about my AAA accelerator I wanted to be able to pick out a couple different labels or or things that might have happened within the conversation so I said they might have asked about pricing of the accelerator they might have asked about the features or benefits they might have asked about me and about the business and about who runs it and they might have asked about something outside of that which have C other then all I'm telling it to do is to Output well identify if they are those labels in the in the transcript and then output a comma separated set of labels for this particular transcript and then all I'm doing is passing in that big smooshed up transcript that we've created I'm passing that in as the input and telling it to okay pick out the labels for this and return it as comma separated labels we then smush those labels together into an array then we're able to send it off to air table and update the record that we've been working on so that's when we pass in okay now we have the whole transcript pulled from the API into that big smos one we can send that back we have also the topics or the tags or the labels that we've got out of the conversation we're going to send those off as well and then we can update the status of it to being a processed record so with all they're talking out of the way we can now show the magic happening live in front of you I've switched over to the process tab which is empty right now but as they go through and are labeled as processed and we've done all the stuff that we wanted to they're going to appear here with their transcript and with their tags as well so if I click the Run once button here we should start to see them populating in here bam transcript topics you can just sit back and watch as it continues to go through all of these different transcripts you'll notice that there's a little bit of a difference between the number in the processed and the number that we're in there ready to process so we can see that it's finished over here it's run through like 40 different messages 14 different rows and in the empty one you'll see there's a couple that have shown up as well with the thread this allows us to get our process data nice and easy put into one table and here you can see the transcripts have been saved all this information here and we have the labels as well as I mentioned there is one more part of this that I've just thrown in there to show you kind of where you can go with this information once you've been able to process it and that is this overview tab up here so what the overview tab does is it's sorted by date so we have each single day of the month you sort of add these records as you need to but what we have is Count columns here so this is the total number of messages that happened on that day this is the number of pricing related questions the questions that have been tagged with sping that have shown up the feature related questions the about questions the other questions now this is a linked record or a linked table to the threads at this point it's set up manually so you can see I can remove this and I have to go in there and add the date as the 17th so you have to go through manually at this point it's a little bit more advanced to set this up automatically but this allows you to show how you can label all of these to a certain date and then start to see some overview data of okay how many messages are we getting as it trending up as it trending down and then you can go into air table interfaces which allows you to make a dashboard out of of this which is an entirely different video but it starts to show you where you can go once you have this kind of quantitative data we have numerical data based off the information and and the things that are happening out in your in your chat Bots and that about wraps up for the video guys I hope this has been helpful I hope this has opened your eyes to how you can be pulling information from the assistant API to get that thread data to get the messages that are happening in all these different channels and aggregate them into one place and then more importantly how you can actually process and analyze that information so that you can start to get some valuable numerical and types of data that you can actually pull insights out of for your business or for the clients that you are working with if you have enjoyed the video please hit down below and leave a like think something like 95% of people who watch these don't leave like so i' really appreciate if you can go down there it supports my channel supports me making videos like this and giving away these templates and everything that I do my you down that you can subscribe to the channel for more videos like this where I teach you how to build AI Solutions and sell them to other businesses or Implement them in your own and if you're not already in my AI business accelerator

              "text": "open AI CEO Sam Alman just got fired and now rehired by Microsoft which has some pretty serious repercussions for us all as AI business owners in 2024 and Beyond don't be fooled this is not your regular startup leadership reshuffle this is a gigantic shift in the direction for a company that we have all built our businesses on top of and in these kind of situations it's more important than ever to get the right information so that you can carefully plann your next steps over the past 24 hours I've soaked up as much information as possible from the smart hardest people I know in the AI space to create this video where I'll be breaking down what happened why it happened and most importantly explaining the three major repercussions for us as AI business owners so that you can start making moves now while everyone else is still confused if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development company called Morningside Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses I'm sure most of you know by now that the open AI board has voted Sam Alman out as CEO Greg Brockman the chairman of the open AI board also left with him in his place we now have a new CEO imit Shar the co-founder of twitch today we've just received news that Sam Alman and Greg Brockman have been hired to lead Microsoft Advanced AI research team which is a huge development in this story The more important question for us is why this has happened if we can figure out the why we can start to guess or at least estimate where the company may be headed under this new leadership while we get to hear official statements from each of the different parties involved the evidence that we do have points to some sort of clash in the leadership between ilas sker and the Sam and Greg Duo this is a fight really between the two camps of research lead by Elliot and product lead by Sam the reason for this Clash is attributed largely to open ai's departure from its original Mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity the company was founded as a nonprofit research lab and the recent Dev day demonstrated a clear departure from this the concept of Revenue sharing on the GPT store seems to be the most glaring example of this there are also rumors of safety concerns with Ilia and the board seeing the recent releases as moving too fast for such a potentially dangerous technology allowing everyone to create their own custom versions of chat GPT with the new gpts release could be seen as handing over the keys of this powerful technology over to the world to play with also the new assistant API allows to create agents that create other agents which in itself is seemingly quite dangerous so what does this mean for us as entrepreneurs looking to build businesses in the AI space well there are three potential repercussions that I've identified the recent open AI Dev day was clearly the straw that broke the camels back therefore the spotlight is on these recent releases for changes or even outright withdrawal of features as mentioned releasing gpts to the public and the idea of Revenue sharing for the upcoming GPT store could have been the red line that was crossed here the fact that chat GPT plus which allows people to create their own gpts has stopped stop accepting new users could be the first step in this Crackdown on gpts as we've cont to know them it could also mean that we see the assistant API change in some way to build in safety precautions as it stands right now as I mentioned before you can create agents that create other agents which in itself is seemingly quite dangerous we will have to wait and see how this all plays out but we really need to keep our ear to the ground to Pivot to whatever open AI does in the near term and adjust accordingly if open AI does change course to moving more slowly and and walk back on some of these product releases we will likely see this void filled very quickly I think that with the gpts release open AI has shown the world what's possible and now everyone has a taste for blood if open AI does end up walking back on this you can bet that a competitor will step up to the plate and give the people what they want the most likely competitor seems to be a Sam Alman and Greg Brockman AI company which picks up where they left off at open AI this may be where us as AI business owners need to move to continue being able to deliver GPT style Solutions the potential with the diversification of the AI industry away from one Behemoth that 99% of all AI apps are being built with will have massive repercussions to illustrate this I've actually got a couple handy slides from the guys at latent space which is a great AI newslet that I'm subscribed to so I'll link them down below if you want to jump on their list as well firstly we have what they call the software 3.0 stack with foundational models like gp4 serving as the system of reasoning a middle layer of tooling and finally some kind of interface be it Voice or chat this is a really handy way of understanding how AI applications are created currently so if you want to pause the video and take a look at this you can do that now next we have a breakdown of the foundational model landscape and how that could change over the next year or two if open AI does do a big pivot here this diagram does assume the creation of a Sam and Greg AI company that raises a boatload of money and becomes a major competitor while open AI kind of drifts off into safer territories I was just in the process of uploading this video as the Microsoft news came out about the hiring of salm and grig so obviously the idea of the salmon GG AI company going off and soaking up some market share from open AI it's the window but it will be very interesting to see how Microsoft moves forward now that they have this Advanced research team led by Sam and Greg and they also have the open AI research Wing as well so we've yet to see what the strategy is going to be but I think it could definitely shake up the industry and continue to sort of diversify the space away from just open AI being the king in the space that everyone is using the possibility of the AI Market becoming a chess board with no Kings would change the landscape for us as AI business owners significantly especially when it comes down to how we build our solution particularly in the kinds of models and tools that we use in this scenario our Solutions may need to be more able to chop and change between competing models more easily which really highlights a massive new need in the market for what's called Model agnostic tooling basically if there are three four five competing foundational models like gp4 clae Etc that are all on the same level we will need to build our Solutions in a ways that are not fixed to one company's ecosystem in order to do this we need to be able to build tools such as knowledge bases web searching image generation and most importantly custom functions that can plug into any of these different ecosystems from the different companies for example you can just build one custom function or one tool and easily swap out the models with minimal friction instead of building your Solutions on the open AI agent platform you would build your Solutions on a platform that allows you to centralize the functionality and then just plug in a model of your choice as the reasoning engine to process user inputs and to call tools as needed conveniently this is exactly what my new platform agentive is designed to do as agency owners operating in an environment like this we need to be more Nimble than ever and being able to centralize your knowledge bases your search capabilities and custom functions will be critical to doing just that myself and my team at War side have created a agentive to make building managing and deploying agents as straightforward as possible for businesses and more importantly for agencies like you who are creating solutions for clients next week we are launching our beta test and we are allowing the first 500 people who sign up to our wait list to get 12 months of free access to agenta there will be a link below in the description if you do want to sign up to the wait list and if you miss out on that first 500 you'll be put in the queue as we onboard more users over the coming weeks ative is starting of course with open AI assistance via the assistance API but this is really just the first step for us towards creating the tooling platform that you will all need to function and prosper in this coming environment I'm so excited to share this with you all and really see how much of an impact it will make on your business and I wish I could say that I planned it but the Sam Alin episode has increased the value of ative massively for all of you finally another key repercussion for AI business owners is the potential slowing of new feature releases from open AI if Ilia has one over the board and has directed the ship back towards its original Focus this will mean a significant reallocation of resources back to his side of the business and drying up the funds that have enabled rapid creation of the models and updates like gpts and the assistance API and to add to the fire Sam's firing has already put open ai's Future ability to raise funds at risk with a pending share sale that would have valued the company at 80 6 billion now being in Jeopardy without a source of new funds and A Renewed focus on Research over products we could see the advancements that we've grown to expect and know from open AI to dry up quickly in this case we can no longer expect new releases from open AI every 6 months that's going to blow our socks off the rate of innovation will likely decrease greatly which will also fit into Ila's desire to slow things down until they can do the research required for everything to be safe in their eyes of course most of this is speculation so I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below if you have any information that have missed or you have a different take on things but what we can say for sure is that the AI space is up in the air right now with Sam and Greg going off the join Microsoft we are entering a new era that will involve significant change but with this as always there will come huge new opportunities for us as early birds to establish our businesses and make money if you're an aspiring AI entrepreneur and want to stay up to date on how you can capitalize on these opportunities as they come be sure to headit down below and subscribe to the channel as I'll be continuing to highlight the ways that you can sell these new AI Solutions as they emerge I also want to add a gentle reminder that this kind of volatility is the price we pay for being in a space with such huge upside potential while you may feel anxious or confused which I definitely do feel as well sometimes remember that this is part of the territory and there will be plenty of time for you to find something that works for you also a reminder if you haven't already signed up to the wait list for ative it's in the description below so if you want to get Early Access or even free access for 12 months to the tools that you need to make money in this market no matter which way things go then you can sign up down and if you want to see my thoughts on the open AI Dev day and the gpts release and how they impact AI businesses then you can check out this video here but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you step by step how to connect your custom gpts to Whatsapp this has been a highly requested video because many of you have created awesome gpts and want to break them out of the chat GPT site and start using them in the real world via things like WhatsApp and get access to its over 2 billion monthly active users by connecting your gpts to Whatsapp you can tap into this massive user base and completely automate key tasks within a business like customer support or lead generation or even appointment setting for your business or for the businesses of your clients the issue with all this is that connecting AI assistants to Whatsapp can be an extremely painful process so I wanted to create this video to walk you through the easiest method that I've found so that you can get things set up and avoid the mistakes that I've made in my own experiences to show how this integration works I will be setting up a WhatsApp lead generation chatport for my own education business from start to finish and as always I will be giving away the templates the code everything that you see in this video at the end so that you can steal this build and start to use it in your own business or sell it to others if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Li otley and I run my own AI development company called Morningside Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the lead generation chatbot that you're going to build in this video let's get into it so what are we actually going to be building in this video we are creating a lead generation chatbot for my AAA accelerator program which allows people to ask questions via WhatsApp to my assistant which is how helping them to learn more about the program and then eventually go for a lead capture once they're ready to purchase which is going to grab their phone number and their full name and we're going to log that to a CRM using air table then we have the system set up that allows them to learn more about the product from a knowledge base I'm going to give it a document that you guys will get access to as well a document that has a ton of information from my website and elsewhere that tells the the AI essentially everything it needs to know about the program and allows people to ask questions about that before capturing their lead and allowing our sales te to follow up from there in order to create this functionality we need a few few things firstly we'll be using the assistant API writing that within repet and then connecting repet to mini chat and mini chat is going to send a messages automatically to WhatsApp I know that might sound like a lot but I've done 99% of the work for you you just need to download the templates and connect them up on your end and then you're ready to go it is worth mentioning for those that are new to the channel that what we are building today is different from the gpts that you've probably built in chat GPT on your own and go through the chat gbt Builder and creating them there what we are building today is different from that and that we are able to take this functionality that we create and then connect it to different applications in this case we are doing WhatsApp I've also got a video on Instagram I've also got a video on putting it on websites so what we are building allows us to create a GPT and then connect that functionality to wherever we want to put it now with the gpts you create on the chat gbt site it's locked within chat gbt and you can't start to use that functionality elsewhere so we are building with the assistant API to allow us to deploy to different channels like WhatsApp Instagram Etc and that's why I'm so big on teaching this assistant API side because it allows you to do so much more and create so much more value for your business and for other businesses as well when you know how to use it properly to start this build off you need to clone my replit which is going to be available in the first link in the description you can sign up to my resource Hub or log in if you already have an account once you sign up there then you can click on the replit which would be one of the links you should be greeted with this page you'll need to sign up to riplet and create an account it is free and on the top right you can click on this Fork button which is going to clone or copy my entire code base so that you can use it yourself and make a couple edits as needed so I'm just going to put Fork at the end of this I'm going to Fork the rapple give it a second to boot up and you'll see something like this which might look familiar to many of you by now I don't want to get stuck in the weeds trying to explain this because there's not much you actually need to modify but I will say if you hit to the functions. P file if you do want to change the document here's the knowledge based document as I mentioned this chatbot this lead generation chatbot has a couple of components if you go back to my three ingredients idea or concept for these uh gpts we have knowledge prompting and actions in this case I have given the prompting which is available in this prompt P file so if you want to change the prompting for your WhatsApp assistant you can come to the prompts file modify this and these changes will be reflected in the new assistant you can create so here's how you can change the prompting if you want to change the knowledge I have a document here on the left panel called knowledge. dox This is referenced down here in the create assistant function if you want to change the document you need to delete it on the left panel you need to upload a new one and then in the functions. P you need to change this document name to be the same as the one on the left panel so that's going to allow you to change the document and the knowledge component then we have the tools component we have the retrieval tool which is necessary to add the knowledge base so you have to have this if you want to have custom knowledge then we have the tools this is the lead capture tool as I mentioned this chatbot has a lead capture functionality this is the only thing I've put in it just to keep it as simple as possible so if you want to change your functions or your tools you can copy and paste this whole function into chat GPT and ask it for new functionality or new tools to be added to get this working on your end you just need to change three things before running this first thing we need to get an open AI key so I'm sure you know how to do this platform. openai [Music] you can create an account if you haven't already you can log into your account and then on the left panel you will have an API key section and you can click create a new key and copy that key as I mentioned in my last video if you want to use this properly and for it to work you do need to head to your settings and go to your billing you need to add a card to your account and you also need to buy some credits here by clicking buy credits you can add $5 or $10 so that it can charge your account properly and be ready to give you access to all of the latest models that will make this thing work so you do have to do that I will mention that now once you have your open AI API key you can head back to riplet scroll down on the bottom left to the secrets panel and then if you click on the uh edit button here the three dots and paste this in then you can get your open AI API key in there you can update the secret next what you need to do is get your air table API key so if you haven't already created an account you can go to my resource Hub there'll be a link to not only sign up to air table and create an account there will be a link to copy this base here that you can see on screen so this is what you'll need has the name the phone number for the lead capture and there's a button up the top corner here called copy base you'll click that and you'll be greeted with something like this where you've actually copied the entire CRM and you have it editable on your end so phone numbers names questions Etc to get your AIT table API key you can click on your profile in the top corner here click on developer Hub and then under this personal access token you can click create a new token and it's going to appear here you can copy that personal access token and then head back to repet and then again you need to click three dots on the air table API key delete it and paste in yours with the air table API key you need to make sure that it says beer space than your key this is something that a lot of people get stuck on and you need to make sure that you can click this eyeball button so it shows you the entire key make sure that it says capital b e a r e r Bearer space and then your long token if you haven't included Bearer space your token and then saved it then it's not going to work with both of those air table API Keys updated you can head back to air table and in this case we want to stay on this Developers page but click on the web API documentation you can scroll down to click on the Smith solar CRM that you've just cloned from my resource Hub then on the left panel you can click on the accelerator leads table then create records then you will see this URL here which is going to allow you to push and create new leads on your air table base and with this you need to copy it bring it back to this create lead function and then replace this section here so boom boom and we all ready to go with that we are ready to run our application for the first time it's important to note that this is when the assistant creation step happens and here's the function that we need to go over so the way I've set this up is that if there is a file in the left hand panel called assistant. Json as you can see here it's going to attempt to load the assistant ID from that file if there isn't a assistant. Json file meaning you haven't already run this app before then it's going to create a new one with the settings that you provided here when I run this app for the first time what it's going to do is run this create assistant function and as you can see on the left hand panel it just created a new file called assistant. Json inside this is where it's going to be storing the key or the identifier for the assistant that you just created so the assistants are a combination of knowledge prompting tooling and that all gets combined together when you interact with the open AI API it's going to create that assistant as a single being and it's going to give you back the ID to be able to talk to that programmatically later in your application so what happens if there's no assistant. JSO file meaning you haven't run the app already it's going to create a new assistant and save the ID here and then every time you run the app after that it's going to load from the file if it is there so in this case if I stop this app right now and I reboot it it's just going to read the assistant ID from that file which means that if I want to modify my assistant I want to go into the functions. py file and I want to change the knowledge document I want to change the tooling I want to change the prompting what I need to do is delete my assistant. Json file and reboot the app and it's going to create a new assistant with the settings save it and then in future it's going to reload that so that's how you can update and delete and manage your assistance within this application for those of you who are looking at this and feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of your depth I I have good news for you because my team at Morningside AI has been working on something extremely exciting and special for you all and it's called agentive the team and I are extremely excited to unveil some more details about what it is and what it does exactly but all I can say is that it will drastically simplify this creation process for you and take out all of this complex custom code and allow you to create it in a much easier way and start to implement the stuff into your business without having to deal with custom code nearly as much I fortunate enough to have a personal brand that attracts some of the best AI development talent in the world to come work for me so what we're about to put out is really the culmination of a ton of work that we've done over the past couple of months so I'm extremely excited to get this out to you all the good news for you is that next week we will be launching our beta test and it's going to be exclusively available to the first 500 individuals who sign up to our wait list for those first 500 who are quick you'll be getting 12 months of free access to agentive so I highly recommend you signing up to get on the wait list as soon as possible if you want to get first and free access to a platform that is going to drastically simplify the workflow that I'm showing in this video a ton more info on this is coming but I thought I'd mention it now so that you can get in on that weight list and get into that first 500 before it's gone down in the bottom right your screen should look a little bit like this and this bottom corner you should have a little red area here so don't worry too much about that that's just because what we're building it on is not a production grade or production ready server I do have a video coming on this so if you want to see how to actually deploy this to a server that can handle a lot of volume and actually be used in production in your business or for clients businesses make sure you subscribe to the channel because that's coming sometime next week and above you should see this not found web view don't worry this is what we're supposed to be seeing all you need to do is click on this new tab button in the corner and leave this tab here because this URL is what we're going to use and the next step which is setting up mini chat so that we can actually connect this to WhatsApp to get the mini chat integration with WhatsApp set up you need to head to my resource Hub and there will be a link to sign up to mini chat firstly so you can create an account and once you're signed up underneath that there will be a link to this template on screen so that once you're signed up and ready to go I'll put a a little video of me signing up and doing the sign up process for WhatsApp what you need to do is make sure you have a Facebook page page and a Facebook account you can sign up to mini chat using your Facebook account it's like a social sign on and then click on the WhatsApp option which will allow you to start to go through the process of getting a number and setting up the WhatsApp integration you need to create a WhatsApp business so you can just give a bit of information then there's a little verification state where you have to get the SMS code from mini chat put it in and then once you've done that you should see a little celebration screen showing that you've successfully connected this new Mini chat WhatsApp number to your mini chat account and you can start sending from it once you've logged in and created your WhatsApp integration you can come back to this temp PL page which will be linked on the resource Hub and then you can click the save to mini chat button in the bottom right it'll pop up with something like this so you can choose the account you want to save the flow to I'm going to view the flow and everything should be pretty much ready to go on here what you need to do is set up the trigger so the trigger is going to be what triggers this Automation in this case I want to click on WhatsApp and I want to have it on a keyword so you need to have the pro account in order for this to work because firstly we're using this particular trigger which is using a keyword but then also to do do the external request steps within mini chat you do need to have a premium account or Pro account I think it cost $20 or $15 so that is the price to set up this integration but if you're doing this for a business it's well worth the money in my opinion so to set up the trigger I'm going to click on new trigger go to WhatsApp and then user sends a message as keyword in this case I want it to be test and I'm going to click create down the bottom so this is going to trigger when someone sends this number a keyword test and now I can walk you through how this application actually works so we have a few steps here and each of corresponds to what we have within our repet but we just need to go through and head back to our not found a page that we opened before and we need to copy the URL including the https so copy the entire URL then head back to mini chat first step we need to do is create a thread and modify this URL delete the old URL and paste in the new one and it should be your url /st start don't worry about anything else you're good to go there we're saving the thread ID from this then we have hey first name what would you like to know about about the accelerator I would be happy to help then we are listening for a free keyboard input so the user can enter their input and we're going to be saving this to the last reply variable you can scroll through then we need to start the run and send this information off to open AI to start generating our response send it to our assistant with their settings and and how we've configured it to deal with this user input and generate our response again we need to come to the URL section and just delete the old one and paste on our new one in this case it should have SL chat at the end and everything else is good we're passing the thread ID that we created earlier and the last reply from the user and sending this off to open AI to generate our response then the final step here is checking the status of that request that we've sent to open AI so we keep checking keep checking keep checking and as soon as it's ready and they've cooked up our response and it's ready to get back then we can grab it and pull it back into our application I don't want to get too deep on this like I did with my Instagram one so if you want a deeper breakdown of all the nitty-gritty of how this application is actually working and the repet there'll be a link up here to my Instagram video which is kind of the same as this but a little bit more in depth if you want to know the ins and outs of the application then you can click up there once you've replaced this URL and you have/ check at the end we can save this and then with that we are ready to give this thing a world and the final step that you need to do to set this up is to come to this and assign this to a member of your team in this case we've got shaia and this is when there's an error that's picked up by our repet by our system it's going to assign the conversation to a human and make sure that no one the AI isn't trying to respond to to errors and stuff like that so we've got a human handoff step here once that's all done we can click the update button and a live version is been updated now we can go to our settings and go to our WhatsApp deployment and we have all the settings here so if you want to modify your WhatsApp business now it's set up with a mini chat you can come here in this case our connected number is this so I can copy this and I'll message them on WhatsApp now once we've pushed the update live we can click on this preview button and switch it to in WhatsApp then we can click the preview button here it's going to give us a link now I want to do this on my phone I'm going to copy this and text it to myself if I click on this link and it's asking me to open in WhatsApp which is great start a new chat and so right away I can delete this and I can say let let's check what our trigger was it's just test so if I go test if we go back to our repet we can also see what's happening in the background here and make sure it's all working correctly new conversation started hey first name in this case hey Sean what would you like to know about the accelerator would be happy to help how much oh I'm caps does it cost unintentional promotion of my accelerator here but it is a good use case so it started a run and there we go pretty quick responses as well that only took a few seconds sted plan 97 monthly um okay great what benefits do I get on premium so this is all pulling from the knowledge base here it looks like gble nonsense but you will get access to it on my resource Hub it's actually a normal document this is just how it's processed on repet and yours will look the same too if you modify it these actually coming back Really really quickly compared to my other tests so this is good so it's giv me back the premium exclusive benefits and at the end of it you can see here it's actually asking for my name and phone number with country code so this is going for the lead capture in my prompt section I have instructions here to uh go for the lead capture at some point in the conversation where it seems like they're ready to convert so it's ask me for my name and phone number I can say um Kim Poss plus 6421 667 great thanks Kim and our in our air table we have Kim Possible that's been added to our CRM ready for our sales team to follow up if you ever run into issues while testing this app be sure to come back to repet and check what's going on which will break down okay the Run was in progress and then it required an action which it performed successfully created the lead and then it sent the response back so everything should be displayed the way I've set it up it should be continually printing information as it goes through all of these responses and that's it for the video I've shown you how to create your assistant within rep I've shown you how to connect that to mini chat and then get mini chat communicating with WhatsApp as well knowing how to do this opens up doors to super powerful use cases for gbts but I get that some of you may struggle with the more difficult Parts such as on ripet and so I reminded that my new tool agentive is opening its doors to its first 500 members which will make this entire process that you've just gone through as easy as just a few clicks so make sure you head down to the description and sign up if you're one of the first 500 people you will get 12 months of free access for being an early supporter of us aside from that if you do want to learn more about building powerful gpts for your business or to sell to other businesses make sure that you subscribe to the channel because I have a ton of new videos coming including how to deploy these two production grade servers so that you can actually run this at some sort of scale and you can start selling it to businesses because what we've set up here in repet is good for testing but not good for proper live applications you can't wait for my next videos what you can do is join my AI business accelerator where we have some of the smartest and sharpest AI entrepreneurs all moving on this gpt's opportunity and sharing knowledge around plus I'm in there doing workshops on this exact kind of stuff multiple times a week as mentioned all templates and resources are available on my free resource Hub in the description so don't forget to check those out so you can get the repl the mini chat and the air table template as well as the knowledge based document everything related to this build is going to be available down there and finally if you're not already in my free telegram I'm giving away free information and and sort of my daily learnings and things that I'm discovering with these GPT so if you're not already in there and you want to stay up to date on things you can sign up with the link in the description and while you're down there leave a like on this video if you've enjoyed I've been putting a ton of work into these for you to show you all the different ways you can use your gpts so continue to support me let me know that you like this content please leave a like the video if you've enjoyed this video and want to know how to put your custom gpts on your website you can click this video up here where I go into depth on it but aside from that that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you step by- step the fastest way to connect your custom gpts to Instagram to completely automate your DMs I'm making this video today because Instagram can be an incredibly powerful sales Channel when used right and by connecting your gpts to Instagram you can completely automate key tasks like customer support and lead generation for your business or for your clients the issue is that connecting AI assistance to Instagram DMS can be an extremely painful process and something that I've had constant issues with over the past couple of months so I wanted to create a video to walk you through the easiest method that I've found so that you can get things set up and avoid the mistakes that I've made at this point in the video I would normally give you a big explanation of what we're building but I think it's easier if I just show you the finished product so we're going to get a live demo here of exactly what we're building in this case I'm using the testing keyword it's going to trigger the automation that I've set up within mini chat which you'll see in a second so in this case I've got some stories up of me and Dubai if you're not already following my Instagram it's going to be available somewhere here you get to see bit the behind the scenes of my life and some of the stuff I get to off camera um but in this case I've got some stories up and I can reply to it of testing and it's going to trigger the Automation and you should see a pop up at the top there we go so it says Hey Liam what would you like to know about the accelerator in this case it's pulling the first name from my account so if your name was Sandy or Smith that would be using that name as the first name um but because this account name is Liam it's going to use Liam what would you like to know about the accelerator would be happy to help um who is the owner so we can start asking some questions in this case it's going to be taking the question that I send there it's going to be sending it to mini chat and then mini chat is going to be talking to our repet back end which you're going to see all the code in a second and I've templated it all so you can just copy it and follow the steps I'm about to show you and you'll be able to get it up and writing so in this case let come back Thea accelerator program is Liam mle it's designed to help individuals establish a profitable and scalable AI business 90 days is there any specific information you like to know about the program um how how much do the plans cost [Music] the AAA accelerator offers two membership tiers standard plan which is $97 monthly Premium plan which is 197 which is currently sold out and so I can keep asking questions about the program I can ask it what are all the benefits what do I get out of it Etc what are the benefits on the standard plan for 97 what do I get you get access to over 15 live workshops a month you get 24 assistant from aam you get exclusive tools accountability groups vets Community templates all the good stuff so what we can say now is to try initiate the lead capture if I say I'd like to join great to here I'll need your full name and phone number including your country code to get started so so this is going for the lead capture now I can say my name is um Bruce Wayne um plus 971 5 2 7 7 8 there we go I can send that information it's going to pull out the name and it's going to pull out the phone number and it's going to send that off to air table to log that lead so that our sales team can follow up with them so that's the that's the build that's what we're going to be creating here you can easily modify this by changing out the knowledge base as you'll see in the steps that are coming in a second and you can also change the CRM from Air table to whatever you want but you'll be able to take the template modified as you need and I'll be walking you through step by step the most valuable part of this is going to be the mini chat template that I'm going to give you which took me like an entire day to create because there's so much so many issues that I have with it due to timeouts and stuff like this which we go into in a sec we have a ton of stuff to get through so let's get into it to achieve the functionality that we just saw we're going to need of course the assistance API from open AI we're going to need a repet to host that code then we're going to call our rep code from mini chat and I will mention it again if you haven't seen any of my other videos but we have the two sort of sides of this gpts release which is firstly the gpts on the chat GPT site where you can create them and sort of go through them and use them use them on the browser and things like this and then we have the assistance API which is really the the meat and potatoes and how this thing is going to be used and rolled out to businesses and to real world applications so while gpts are fun and all and they're cool to create around and sort of share around with people most of the value is going to be created with this assistant API so you can deploy your gpts and your your setups essentially to different channels in this case we're going for an Instagram deployment and using the GPT technology for that on my prior videos we've done website deployment so if you want to check out how to put these on a website rather than on Instagram you can do the exact same process but put it onto a website watching the video that's up here I've got a couple of them now but this is the best one to start with okay so to get started with this build you first need to get access to my repet as always this is going to be available in the first link in the description you can go to my resource Hub sign up for free and it's going to be at the bottom of the list in the left panel you can click on it there'll be a link that will take you to this ret and you should be greeted with a screen like this first step is to go to the fork button on the right we can click Fork here and we can call it I'm just going to put a fork at the end and then I can Fork the tripple give it a second to boot up then you should be greeted with something like this for those of you who don't know how to code don't freak out you don't need to change any of this really and there's only a couple parts that I'll walk you through the process of and that's mainly around API key so I build this in a way that it's all ready to go out of the box I'll just take you through a bit of a breakdown of how this is different from some of my other tutorials and the way that I've had to modify this so that it works with the Instagram deployment this actually took me quite a while to get working because there's limitations of Min chat which I'll go into later um but we can start off where they breakdown of the main. pi file which is where all the all the action is happening when we're actually interacting with this application similar to the other builds that I've done firstly we have the SL start endpoint which is going to start the conversation whenever we start a conversation within mini chat a new person interact with my story they hit that trigger it's going to call this mpo the/ start and it's going to create a new thread we're going to give that thread back to our mini application so here we are giving the thread ID back and then when the user actually asks their question it's going to be sent to this chat inpo and that chat inpo is going to grab the thread ID and the message then let's go to start a run what's called a run in the new open AI documentation and the way that they've set up the assistant API so you have what's called a run and in this particular build we have split the chat endpoint between this chat one and then the second one called check now the reason we've done that is because of the Timeout on Mini chat is 10 seconds and when I was testing this before I wasn't able to get responses on Mini chat because it was running over that 10-second timeout when I was making the API Co so we've had to split it into these two different parts this chat endpoint is just going to create the run and sort of send our information and what we need to do up to the open AI servers and it's going to be like okay that's what we want now give us a couple seconds and we'll wait for it to come back and the way we actually grab the response from that endpoint and we've called the open AI API to give us our response then we go down to this check in point we're going to be periodically checking in to see if our process our our operation has been completed and if it has been completed then we can pluck it out and send it back to the user so might sound a bit complicated but in this case it's going to make a lot more sense when we get into the mini chat side of thing so bear with me next I'll take you to the functions. pi file this is where a lot of the the core functionality is happening um in this case we have the lead capture so this is a air table lead capture we going to be replacing this URL with a new one um as you set it up on your end we have API Keys which we'll be setting up in a second this is the logic for creating a new lead in the air table as I mentioned and this is the create assistant function which is really the main bit that you need to wrap your head around before going out and trying this on your own so the create assistant function is because when you're trying to create a new GPT programmatically in this case we're not using the GPT Builder we are creating our own programmatically we need to give the instructions or the ingredients to the open AI API to create our new assistant so in this case we have of course the knowledge component which is going to be a document here on the left called knowledge. dox then we have the instructions which are going to be in the prompts dop file which we show you in a second then we have the functions which is set up here so I'll show you how to change each of these around so that you can modify this so that you can create your own gpts for your own use case so in this case we have the file here which is going to be the knowledge based document if you want to change the knowledge base to your own document you need to delete the knowledge based document on the left here and then click upload file here upload a new file and then you need to change the name of this file here from knowledge. do to whatever it is in the left panel so name here should match the name of the document on the left hand panel next if you want to change the promp thing or the instruction for your gbt it's going to be stored in this variable here so the assistent instructions is imported from our prompt. piy file which is over on the left here so if you want to change the promp thing or the instructions for your GPT click on the prompt stop High file on the left I've taken this out because it doesn't look very clean to have this massive amount of text sort of stuffed into your functions of P file so I've moved it out to here so you can go in and modify this as you like and any changes that you make here are going to be automatically pulled in to this create assistant function when you create it to to reiterate we have the knowledge component here which we can change we have the prompting component here which we can change via the prompts dop file and then finally we have the tools section uh now the tools and order to be able to use I should have mentioned this in some of my other videos so thank you for those of you who pointed it out but the model here that we're calling the GPT 4 preview you actually need to have a card put on your open AI account and you need to add some credit to your account if you haven't yet done that going to need that which will show you in a sec but in order to be able to access this new model which is able to use GPT the much larger GPT 4 which is faster and and better in a number of ways we need to do that step so just to be clear some of you had issues with that last time that is the reason why and I'm going to be showing you in a second how to fix that so when it comes to tools this is the more difficult part to change around I will be completely honest but just to walk you through it firstly we have the retrieval tool here this is the knowledge base as you can see I put a lot of comments throughout all this document so if you get stuck you have a question about something not working or you want to know how to modify things take a look at these green comments and you'll get a much better idea of how this application is set up so we have the retrieval tool which is the knowledge base this needs to be on for it to be able to access that knowledge document then secondly we have just one function here which is the lead capture the lead capture in this case is using the create lead function which is up here it's referencing that name then we get to the two parameters required to call this function firstly we have the name which is obviously the full name of the lead and then we have the phone which is the phone number of the lead including the country code it's important to know that to operate this application when you have the three different ingredients you have your knowledge base your instructions then these and then the tooling here as well when you go to create an assistant when we run this app up here for the first time it's going to look on this left panel and see if there's an assistant. Json file in this case you can see that we don't have one so it's going to follow this and say okay if there is an assistant. Json file let's load that but if there is not then let's go through the creation process and then create a new file down here so this is our way of of not duplicating and making a ton of different assistants when we don't need it you're going to be charged API usage by how many assistants that you have up especially if you're putting a lot of knowledge in them you get charged by the the amount of storage that you're taking out with your documents as well so in this case it's only going to create a new assistant when there isn't one already in the side file and this also means if you've already run the app once and you have a assistant. Json file on the side panel here if you want to modify the knowledge the prompting or the tools then you need to delete that file and then run the app again it will recreate your assistant. Json file with a new set of settings okay and with that orientation out of the way we can get into modifying the very few parts of the code that we actually need to change in order for it to work on your system firstly we have our open AI API key pretty straightforward one you can go to platform. open a.com then on the left panel here you'll have an API key section and you can click here and create a new secret key it's going to pop up with a a key that you can copy and you can copy that you can take it back over to reflet here then you need to go to the secret section down the bottom left we can delete this Google Cloud API key cuz that's not needed for this one um but in this case we have open AI API key you can edit this and then you can paste yours in and then update the secret and as I mentioned before in order to make sure that you get access to these newer models that we need to make this app run on the left hand panel here you can click on settings and then billing you can add a payment method and then you can click on this buy credits button and put 5 to10 in so that you have full access and permissions to use all of the latest models next we need to set up our air table and get our air table API key so in this case you'll be going to the resource Hub again which is in the first link of the description you can sign up to there and then on the resource Hub there'll be a link to firstly sign up to air table if you haven't already and there'll also be another link for you to be able to clone my air table base here so when you click on that link it should look like this in this case we have these two tabs here this is just going to be the accelerator lead is what we're looking for and you should have this button up here that says copy base so when you click that it should clone it over to your account and look a bit like this so just to take you through quickly we have the the names of the leads we have the phone numbers and we have the questions and a status so the main ones that we're going to be dealing with within this app are the name and the phone number I'll talk a little bit more about these questions at the end once you see it live once you have this base created we need to get our API Key by going to the right panel here clicking on this little uh profile icon then going to the developer Hub then you'll be on this page where you can create API key so you can click create new token you can call it uh Instagram lead genin bot you can go to Scopes and click right and we'll give it read as well and access you need to scroll down to your Smith solo CRM and you can click the create token button and it should pop up with an API key that you can copy so you want to copy that and then head back to repet and in the same way we just did with the open AI key you can click on the three dots to the right of your air table API key and if you haven't found Secrets it's in the bottom left here click on that and this should appear and you can edit again copy all of this and paste or delete all of this and put your API key in inste and update secret and then one final thing that we need to do is go back to our air table developers page and then click on this web API documentation on the left then you need to scroll down to the bottom and click on the Smith solar CRM and then can click on the accelerator leads table and then click on create records then you need to take this URL here copy all of that from https all the way to the end of leads copy that head back to repet and go to the create leads function in the functions. py file and then just copy Within delete within the quotations there and then paste in that URL so mine's the same so it doesn't need to change obviously but yours will have changed a little bit with this little section here and with all of those changes made we are ready to run our application for the first time we need to click this big green button up the top and on the left pan panel you'll see that we'll get our assistant. Json file created because now it's going to create an entirely new assistant based off our settings inside our create assistant function so the settings we have here with the knowledge base with the prompting and the tools it's going to sort of smoos that all together and create this assistant. Json file and all it has in here is this so yours will be a little bit different but this is what we're going to be reloading it from so if I stop it and restart it it's going to this time read from this file and pull in that and save that as the variable in our main function if all has gone well you should see something similar to this in the bottom right corner and you'll also see a web view that's popped up here saying not found it's not an issue we can click on this new tab button in the corner and it's going to open up a new tab for us here this is the URL that we're going to be calling within Min chat to get access access to all of the functionality that we have in our main.py file so our start chat and check endpoints that we can access by mini chat with that all of and running correctly now we can get onto the mini chat side of things I've created a template for you that you can just plug and play and change a couple URLs so if you want to get access to that again you can sign up with the first link in the description then you can get access to the mini chat template when you click on it it should look like this when you get on screen if you don't already have an account for Min chat you'll need to click on the sign up button then it allow you to log in with Facebook and you can go through the whole setup in this case you want to click on Instagram and go through the process this can be a little bit tricky so I've actually got a a recommended tutorial from someone else when I had a bunch of issues with getting this set up earlier today I walked me through some of the basic setup for creating a Facebook page and linking it and the right way so that it works so there's a lot of moving Parts when it comes to your Facebook pages and accounts and your profiles and all these different things so I don't want to try and drag this thing out to be 40 minutes long so there's like a 3 or four minute tutorial where the guy explains it really well that'll be linked down below if you haven't got an account I'd watch that so you can set up firstly your Facebook faceb page and then connect that to your Instagram account so that everything's all tied up there then you can come back here all signed in and ready to go once you've signed in to mini chat you can come back to this page and again click on save to mini chat and it's going to this time loaded into your account so I can click on Save flow here for the account that I've set up view flow and just like that you have imported the template that I spent hours working on today to get working for you all so this is going to save you a ton of time I'll walk through it briefly now and we'll be updating what we need to along the way to save time starting off we have a trigger if you're familiar with these automation platforms you'll know that triggers are how things start off in this case we are using a story reply trigger that I have set up on the keyword testing I'm actually going to change this to test two so you know that I'm actually testing the one that I built in front of you this is set up to be listing on all stories when a reply contains specific words or reaction in this case the test two word is going to be what it's looking for if that trigger is hit then it goes to the first step in our application which is to create a thread creating a thread is the first step in our application and this calls the Slash so this is creating a new thread under your assistant that's essentially the start of a new conversation or a new bucket of chat history that we're going to be tracking the conversation for in this case we can grab our URL from the repet not found page copy this head back to mini chat and we need to replace this URL up to the start point with our URL so M should just pop and Fork there make sure you don't have two for slashes like that so it should just be your URL and then SL start if we go through here yeah not much you need to worry about here we're saving the thread ID into a custom field code thread ID don't touch any of this here just leave it with all the numbers included by this point we've created a thread and now we can say hey first name what would you like to know about the accelerator I'd be happy to help and then we are going to be listening for a response so this is a a free keyboard input so it's just waiting for them to send something through what we're doing is saving that to the variable called last reply which is what we're going to send off to our next endpoint in order to start the process of generating a result so we send that off to this first step which is just a clear AI output field just to make sure that the variable is empty don't need to worry about that too much the key point is that after that we go to the start run step now here we are doing the same thing with the URL again you need to paste in your URL and have the entire URL and then slash chat this time so again first one will start this time it's chat next one will be check and these will correspond to the different endpoints that we've set up in our application so they start creates a new thread starts the conversation the chat endpoint starts the Run sends off the information to openai to start processing the answer and then the final one which we're about to see in a second is what checks it and Returns the answer so going back to Min chat you can leave these as they are but just to give you an idea we are sending away to our chat endpoint to start the processing the thread ID and the message from the user which we are getting from earlier where we created the thread ID we've saved that and we're referencing it here and the message which we are pulling from the last reply that we just got from the user we're sending that off and what this returns to us is a run run ID now this run ID is what we need to be able to check the status of the sort of order that we've sent off to open AI now that we have created the thread we've got the users input we've sent that off and said can you work on this for us now we can periodically check back in to see the status of that response and we do that via our run ID run ID is already set up here and then we pass that run ID to our final endpoint which is of course the check endpoint which is checking the status of the Run make sure you have your url here/ check in the body of this request we sending away the thread ID and the Run ID to check the status of that run and the response that we should be getting back here is the answer to the user's question so this is the final output that we do present to the user and send within the Instagram DMS and this part here is probably the most difficult but to understand but this is how we are allowing it to Loop through as I mentioned before mini chat has a 10c uh cut off a Timeout on the API request so the issue I was having here is that when I was trying to create this earlier today I kept running into this issue of it would answer the shorter questions but then whenever I asked for a longer response it would just completely blank and wouldn't send anything and after a lot of searching around I eventually figured out that there is a 10 second Timeout on this and unfortunately a lot of the stuff that we do particularly with function calling and and knowledge bases can take longer than 10 seconds to get back to us the way that we get around this timeout is this conditional block here in which if the check end point returns timeout then we're going to loop back around and try it again so if you look back at our code we have this check Endo here and it has a timer of 9 seconds so it's going to check the status of the run over and over and over again which you'll see in the bottom right here in a second it's going to be printing out run and progress run and progress run in progress run in progress and then when it's complete it's going to send it off but if the run is still in progress and by the time it gets to the end of that 9 seconds it's going to send back a timeout and say hey look we've run out of time then we're going to try it again and check how much longer so this will make more sense when you see it in action in a second but it does work and I'm very happy that I was able to get this working for you all and then we have an error handling step where if the AI outputs some kind of error we're just going to assign it to a human to to handle the conversation and the final part of this conditional check is that if there isn't a timer as in we don't have to keep waiting for a response and there isn't an error then we can go down and send the final AI output that we get back from the check inpoint and we can send it to the user and await their next input this final step here is printing out the AI output and we're also at the same time expecting input from them and saving it to last reply and with that last reply we can Loop right back up to here and then go through the whole process again I'm saying okay now we have a new user input let's firstly send it off to the chat endpoint get that cooking away and the open a servers then we can check into it over and over and over again until it comes back as a complete response I think that's enough talking we are ready to get this thing tested I just want to do one final check and you guys should all make sure you do this that we have updated the URLs for all of them so Instagram accelerator ass for/ start yep that's correct go here slash chat yep that's the second one and then SL check yep we are all good to go here now I can click the update button here and I'm ready to give it a test on the phone we're on the phone here and I can pull up my story and I can say test to send that we should get an automated message any second yep there we go hey Liam what would you like to know about the accelerator would be happy to help um what coaching do you offer now I do want to pull up on the other side the repet back end so so it's handy to watch it as I send this we should see things pop up like it start to thread checking for status and progress and progress and progress so you can see the debug here the way that I've set it up it's going to be printing out and giving you updates very constantly on how things up oh there we go you can see here in the console that it's been checking for the status of the run and it's been in progress and progress and progress and when it gets to the end of that 9-second period it goes okay I need to send a timeout response and then we need to try loop back again and continue to check in this case it's timed out once then it started the next Loop and then immediately found that the response was ready and then we sent it in this case we have it on our phone here personalized assistance regular one-on ones exclusive resources Etc Great and then we can try to get a lead capture going here so I'm ready to start and again watching the console here in progress in progress in progress completed and boom it sends it through now we need a full name and phone uh um P to Parker like a jacket and that should ask for my phone number as well sure I'll give you my phone number now it should go for a lead capture here requir action action and process lead created success F checking run status and progress and progress completed and it sends it back and now we should pull up our air table here we should have Peter Parker there we go we've got two of them and that's the builds we can continue to ask questions here and going through and learning more about the product but we have done the lead capture I think it will allow us to do another lead capture even but in this case we've gotten what we wanted out of it they've been able to ask questions make a decision and we've captured the lead that we can send to the sales team and they can follow up on there is this column here of question that I was going to include but it made it a little bit more complex and I think many chat has already made this as complex as it needs to be but this questions column was intended to be a an additional field for the lead capture function which can pull out of the thread out of the transcript of the conversation it can pull some of the questions that the user ask and add them to this field when you capture the lead so that the sales person can look at the questions column and go okay this person was worried about price or this person was worried about the features or or the team Etc that's not something I've included in this build but it is possible if you guys want me to make a video breaking down how you can get all of the transcripts from your assistants from say your Instagram deployment from your website deployments anywhere you want it we can be pulling those and centralizing them somewhere so if you want me to do a video on it I have had some requests already but please let me know in the comments below and I'll I'll make sure I get that out as soon as possible as I mentioned in my last video there's repet application is not properly deployed it's not production grade and production read this just allows you to spin it up and see how it works quickly if you do want me to do a video breaking down how you can actually do a live production grade deployment of one of these applications using repet or other ser Services also let me know in the comments because I can make that video too if you've got this far congratulations this is definitely one of the tougher tutorials I've done and there's definitely a lot more complexity that I've had to to work into this to get it working on Instagram which is just really the nature of the platform right now so I hope You' been able to follow along and get as much out of this as possible if you have enjoyed please hit down below and leave a like I put a timeon of work into this thing it's actually been delayed a bit just by the amount of issues that I've had with trying to get a way that works for you guys as easy as possible so I'm sure many of you going to take this and be able to do some awesome stuff with it um I hope the use case is a little bit different from the solar one that I've I've talked about a lot I wanted to show you how this can be used for more educational products or coaching offers and things like this and not only handle questions and sort of customer support but also go for lead capture and things like this to create a lead generation chatbot on Instagram using your GPT technology and of

watching this you've probably already created some awesome gpts within the chat GPT Builder but you want to break them out of the chat GPT site and start using them in the real world or you want to learn more about how to add powerful custom actions to your gpts to make them more useful for your use case unfortunately a lot of people still don't understand what the new assistance API is and even I was confused by it at first but knowing what it is and how to build your own custom gpts with it puts you in the top 1% of people who are chasing down this opportunity so by the end of this video you'll not only know how to build your own custom gpts using the assistant API and put them on your websites but you'll also know how to plan create and Implement insanely powerful custom actions into your gpts to create real value for your businesses or for your clients and at the end end of the video I'll be giving away everything that I'm building today as a template so that you can steal this insanely powerful lead generation chatbot and start using it in your own business or selling it yourself if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own sixf figure development company called morning side Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the lead generation chat bot that you're about to build let's get into it to kick things off I'm actually going to be showing you the finished product here on screen so that you get an idea of where we're going with this and how much value we are creating when we do this right so on screen is a template website that I've downloaded just refreshing the page so you can see that it's live if I click on the widget in the right here up Pops the chat window and I can start talking to it hi I'm Lucy Smith's solar assistant I can help you with any questions on solar for your home I can also calculate the potential solar savings for your property how can I help you today that gives you an idea of the two functionalities of this chat bot so firstly we can ask questions to the knowledge base what is the cheapest type of panel this will be querying our knowledge based document which you guys will get to see in a second it's a general faq's and information brochure for anything related to solar for single family homes here we have the answer the cheapest type of solar panel is poly crystalline solar panel great so that shows the knowledge Bas is working but more importantly here's the feature help me calulate my soul solar savings help me calculate my solar saving plit the assistant is going to pick up on this and going to realize that we need two inputs which is going to be their home address and their monthly electricity bill in USD so for this I'm picking someone's lucky address um in the United States so let's grab this one here click on this sorry to whoever's homeless is broadcasting your address out copy this head back and if I just put in just the address here it should ask me for the monthly bill as well cuz it needs the two inputs to calculate this great thanks for sharing your address to proceed I'll also need your average monthly electricity bill so let's say I'm spend $250 $ per month now it's going to take that address it's going to take that monthly cost of power and it's going to call the Google solar API bring it back and tell us exactly what kind of savings we can expect for our property if we choose to convert to solar there we have it it's given us a full breakdown of our options for solar based off allocation I'll break this down a little bit more later it's really really complex stuff that's going on behind the scenes here but essentially it's giving us information like our payback period and the 20e savings we're going to experience any federal incentives that are associated with our location but that's not even all this thing at the end it asks for a lead capture so it's asking me for my phone number and my name and then if I provide that I go Le artly and I give it a phone number phone number and I give that to them then what this is going to do is take that information and it's going to a take my address and it's going to push that all to a CRM which I'm going to show you how to set up later and then we have it thank you your details have been passed to our team someone will be in touch with you soon so that's the breakdown and a demo of the bot but before we get into the building I need to do a little bit of explanation so that you're fully clear on the difference between creating gpts as you are on chat GPT and creating your own cool ones within the chat GPT website and the kind of thing that we're building over here which is using the assistant API these are your two different ways of creating gpts now on the chat GPT Builder they are locked inside of that of the interface you can't take what you create on the chat GPT site when you build these things and then go and slap that on your website or put that on WhatsApp or put it wherever you want you are locked into that and it's intended for you to just use it in there as a handy little kind of personal tool I've said that gpts in this way are like consumer toys they're focused for the mass market and and consumers to engage and have fun with and build these gpts but the other side of this is using the assistance API I've been over this recently in my other videos but it's important that you understand the difference and that most of the value is going to be unlocked through this assistance API because this allows businesses and anyone really to take that same GPT functionality that you create there which is really cool but then take that and put it wherever you want integrate it into any application any website any voice assistant whatever you want so what I'm teaching you in this video is how to use that side of thing is the assistance API Which is far more powerful and is going to create far more value in our world and really be a much more valuable skill than being able to make uh little fun gbts on the chat gbt website then we need to get into a little bit of a deeper breakdown of what we're building and how we're going to build it so if you haven't figured out already we're making a lead generation chat bot for solar companies that's going to be put on their website which is intended to help leads and people who are interacting with the website to get to their questions firstly if they have any questions related to hey what solar panel is the best what financing options what's this what's that anything that they could want to ask as if they were talking to a solar expert we're going to allow them to ask that to the chat bot which can respond from a knowledge base using a document that we're provided containing this kind of information secondly this chat will also allow them to calculate their potential solar savings if they were to install a system and we're going to do that by taking in their address and their monthly powerb and sending that off to Google solar API and getting the response back from that and then finally once I've got that back from the calculator tool we're going to ask them for their lead information so we can capture the lead and follow them up we can break it down into my three ingredients concept for creating gbts which is prompting knowledge and actions the prompting is going to tell it that it is an assistant for Smith solar that it can answer questions from a knowledge base regarding solar questions and it can also provide calculations and it can also capture the lead at the end of it so that's all the information that we're stuffing into the problem for the knowledge component we are uploading a single document containing a ton of information on solar for single family homes and finally the actions are going to be calculate solar savings using the solar API and then capture the lead and send it to air table the stack of technology that we're using to create this assistant is firstly the assistant API of course the solar API and geocoding API from Google repet to host it and voice flow to be the front end for it okay to get started you need to Fork my refet template which is going to be available in the first link in the description you can sign up to my resource Hub it's 100% free and there'll be a link in the resource hub for this particular video where you can get access to this rip now when you click on the link it's going to take you to the screen and what you're going to want to do is click on the fork button on the right here and we're going to give it a name solar lead gen chatbot and we can Fork it if you give it a second it will boot up in here then you'll be greeted with this here for those of you who aren't developers or don't know how to code this might seem a little bit overwhelming but don't worry i' set this up in a way where you don't need to do any any major changes to get the kind of results you're looking for and any ones that you do I'll Point them out very clearly and it's just a couple characters or words that you need to change so we have our main.py file here which has our endpoints the chat inpoint and the start inpoint don't worry too much about this we have the functions. pi file which has all the specific functionality such as creating a lead on a table such as pulling the data from the solar API Etc so all of the the fun stuff happens in here then at the bottom we have our create assistant function I have gone pretty heavy on the comments throughout this file so when it comes to modifying it and changing the knowledge or the functions there should be plenty of comments to help you figure out what you need to do but I'll take you through a crash course now because I know many of you will want to take this change the knowledge change the function so this is how you can do it so for changing the knowledge which is the easiest one to do we have the knowledge. docx which is referencing the document on the left here so if you want to change the document you can delete that and you can upload a new one by clicking this so you can upload a new file and just make sure that the name of the file is referenced here exactly if you want to add multiple files you'll need to copy and paste this multiple times and save them to different files I recommend that you paste this entire function from the top down and to check gbt and say hey I'd like to add multiple files cuz it needs to add a couple different rows here duplicate that and then down the bottom here we need to pass in more than one file ID so that's for changing the knowledge for changing the instructions we have this instructions assistant instructions variable reference here and what this is actually doing is pulling from up here we have an import from our prompts file and on the left here is the prompts file that we're talking about so the assistant instructions and the prompts STP if you want to change the instructions for your assistant this is where you need to do it so by changing this you can take a look at how I've set this thing up here but by changing this you're going to change the prompting and the behavior of the chatot and the information in here as you look at my stuff you'll see that it's referencing how to use the knowledge it's referencing how to use the tools and what to do after so one of the cool things that I added in here was that after the assistant has provided the user with their solar calculations they should ask for their name and phone number so that one of the team can get a contact with them about installing solar for their home so that is instructing it to after you've triggered that tool then do this which is what you'll see later in the app where it actually asks for the lead capture at the end of the response from the tool so if you want to change the prompting and the instructions you need to come to the prompt stop High file modify that if you want to change the knowledge you need to come to the top of the create assistance function and modify this and modify your documents when it comes to modifying the functions it's definitely the harder part but I'll try to walk you through it as quickly as possible now and make it as simple as possible so from a high level we have in the setup for our system we have our different functions so again this bit here is knowledge tool so wec retrieval means that it's adding the knowledge base retrieval tool which is going to handle the knowledge base up here but the one below it is a function so we have our solar panel calculations and then we have the properties and the inputs it provides so we need the address and we need the monthly bill and both of them are required and the same down here we have another function called create lead which is going to log the lead in the database it has a little description and then it's going to need the name the phone the address and all of them are required now you don't need to write these all yourself that you can ask chbt to assist you with this and by pasting in this entire function it's going to show them exactly how you need to do it so this is your reference and chat gbd can help you to modify it now when it comes to actually what functions are being used the name of the function here needs to match the name of the function that you want to call in this case I want to call this which is my sort of full calculations function again if I go down to here the name of the function is called create uncore lead and at the top I have create uncore lead now this all comes together when you go to the main.py file so over here if I scroll down to the chat endpoint and I scroll down to this section you'll see in this part here if the assistant picks up action required meaning one of the tools has been triggered based off the natural language description of capture the lead details calculate the solar potential if one of those are triggered it's going to come down here and look up for the different function names so we have the solar panel calculations and the create lead when the assistant initiates the action it's going to pass the name through and we can go okay what's the tool call that it's called what's the name of that okay it matches the solar panel one great then we want to call from our fun functions file the solar panel calculations and that takes the address argument and it takes a monthly bill argument you can see this back here it takes an address and a monthly bill and in this case we are just pulling from the tool call we are pulling the address as the first parameter and the monthly bill as the second parameter so might seem a bit complicated but again if you paste this into chat gbt it should understand what you're trying to do same thing happens down here with the create lead again we needed to have three parameters in here which is the name phone and address and if the function name that was matched within the tool matches the create lead name here then it's going to trigger that and pass the arguments in and then output it so that might be a little bit complex for some of you but I did promise that you would understand how to put these things together and how it all fits you might need to go back and break that down a couple of times but that is how it works the next step for you to set this up is to head over to Google Cloud so cloud.google.com and you need to come on here and create account I assume you've already got a Gmail account then you can click on go to console you might need to do a bit of setup and sort of creating an account on the Google Cloud platform once you're in you should see this and then what we need to do is come up to the top left let's create a new project I'll call this Sol chatbot for this I'll be using my YouTube projects billing account in your case you'll need to set one up um just so you're clear on the of cost I've been using this a decent amount and I've been charged under a dollar so these things are very cheap to use for the API usage so create your building account you need to put a card on it so that they're able to verify it and allow to start using it but once you've set up your billing account and put a card on file you'll be able to select it here and then for the organization I'll just leave it as none so it's going to take a second for it to create my project then I can click select project here so that I jump into it then once it's all set up what you can do is click on the apis and services section here and go to library and then what you want to do is search up geoc coding geoc coding click on the geoc coding API need to enable that when you successfully enable that it should pop up with this API key message so you can copy your API key here which is what we're going to need to use and our application to be able to call the solar API so we can copy this save it somewhere and go continue to Google Maps um maybe later for the protecting my API key then we'll go back to apis and services let's close this on the side then you'll see the solar API appear here so we can click enable on the solar API give that a second and we can scroll down to make sure we have the GE coding API enabled great we have our Google Cloud set up we have our API key and we have the solar API and the geocoding API enabled you want to grab that API key and come back over to our ret and if I scroll to the secret section and click on Secrets should see the Google Cloud API key section here what you want to do is click the edit button here and then paste in your API key here and click update secret next we need to set up our air table to log all of the leads which will act as our temporary CRM you can use obviously any kind of CRM that you like I just like using air table because I'm very familiar with the API so in this example we'll be using air table I do have a base here that you'll be able to copy if you want to get access to this CRM you can copy and clone it over to your account it'll be in the resource H as well so there'll be a link to click on that then you should see a page like this and you will see this button here that says copy base so if you copy that it's your air table account you'll have the sour it up as I've got it done here then we need to do one more thing which is to go onto our developer Hub on the right here and you will see all of our personal access tokens so you'll need to click on create token up here on the right give it a name uh we'll call it lead gen chatbot not the best name and we can go to uh Scopes and we need to add data records read data records write and then we need to set up the access so in this case I'm going to go down to Smith Sol CRM and add that and then I can create the token it'll then pop up with your API key which you need to copy and then bring back over to replit again and do the same process so click here edit and then paste it in and save the updated API key the final step for setting up these Keys is to get your open AI API key to create or copy your API key for openai you can come to platform. open.com ai- keys and on the page here you will see a button to create a new secret key you can click this button it will give you a new key you can copy that back over to here and do the same process of updating the API key now I've all mentioned I had a bunch of people asking in the comments that they couldn't get access to the model that we are using in this particular build that's because you likely need to put your card on file what you need to do is go to the settings on the side here you need to add a card for building you're not necessarily going to be build for it because you do have that free allowance but you need to put a card on file so that they allow you to use these models just a little issue I saw in the comments of the last video the very last bit of setup we need to do here is to get our air table based URL so what you can do is click on the uh profile icon in the corner click on developer Hub and then we can click on web API documentation and then you can scroll down and click on your Smith solar CRM and that will take you to the documentation for your particular base which is super handy if you scroll down to the leads table in this case we want to go to create leads record and it will give you a URL here so we want to copy this all the way up to the end of the leads word and we've already set this up when I wrote the code this is already kind of integrated into the function all you need to do is head back and come to this create lead function and replace that entire bit there I already have mine in there so it didn't change anything but you should replace this URL with your url with all of that done we are pretty much ready to boot this thing up let's just save this file make sure we've all saved up let's go back and give the main. power file a save as well and we can click this big juicy Green Run button on the top give it a second and it's going to boot up on the left panel here you'll see that there is no assistants. Json and you'll see a file pop up here in a second so give it a sec and then we have the assistant. Json file pop up the way that I've set this up is that the create assistance function will run at the start of every time you run the application but what it's going to do is check in the left hand panel for this assistants. Json file if there is none there it will try to create a new assistant every assistant that you create on the open AI servers costs you an API usage so you don't want to have creating a new assistant every time you run the app so what this does is if there is no assistant file available it's going to go through the creation process and look at okay what model am I using okay what am I tools am I using okay I have this knowledge based I have these two functions Etc and it will sort of combine all those ingredients and then push that up into the servers create the assistant and then what it sends back is the assistant ID and that assistant ID is saved to this Json file and at the end of this function it is sent back to the main function if there's already assistant created it's just going to load it from the file which is great we're not using unnecessary amounts of API usage but if there isn't it's going to create a new one and save that for the next time what this means for you is that if you want to recreate your assistant and you want to change the configuration say you want to change the knowledge bace or you want to change how the functions operate what you need to do is delete this assistant. Json file and then run the app again and it's going to create it with the new settings so just so you understand how I'm managing the assistant ID and creation of assistant in this application if you did everything right you should have this down in the bottom left corner where it says it's running now and this window would have popped up in the web view but it says not found it's not an error don't worry this is how it's supposed to be but what you want to do is click on this new tab button click there and it's going to pop up with this URL here so this is where our web servers being hosted this is how we can interact with the application we've just built but we're not going to do it through a browser we're going to do it programmatically within voice flow which brings us to our next step in this build which is to sign up to voice flow if you haven't already there's going to be a link in the description if you want to sign up there this is my favorite bot building platform and this is what I build a lot of the stuff I build at my development company if we going to go sort of the lower code route this is the best platform that we have found for creating these kind of builds I really love using this platform and highly recommend it if you're going to be doing anything like this once you've logged in you should see a screen like this now what you're going to need to do is go to my resource Hub and download the voiceflow template so I've already created a template for you um that does everything you need to do out of the box as you're going to see in a second but in order to get that you need to sign up to my resource Hub it's free and you can download that file then once you've downloaded the file you need to come back to voice flow and click on this import. VF file and then your downloads you should be able to select your voice playay file in this case there's one down here when you click that and click open it's going to pop up in the corner and ask if you want to open the assistant which you reply yes to and then you will see a screen that looks a little bit like this so this is as simple as it is for us to be able to deploy all of our functionality that we've created and all of the assistant API magic to a website and to a website widget chat FL so just to walk you through the voice flow build quickly we have firstly here our create thread so this is going to be where we paste in our URL if you come back to this page here come and copy this and then to replace this you just need to go up to the start you should have slash start at the end of your url make sure it's exactly like that it's your url SL start that's all you need and then you can come to this one as well generate response and do the same thing replace this URL with your one and then we have everything set up walk you through things again this is where we create a thread by calling this URL we're going back to our repet here which has this function in our main.py which is the/ start start so this is going to create a new conversation this is going to create a new thread in our assistant and then we're going to be able to say hey I'm Lucy Smith solo assistant I can help you with any questions about solar for your home I can also calculate your potential solar savings how can I help you today then we're going to wait for the user's input we're going to capture that then we're going to send that off to our other endpoint which is the SL chat and then we have it here which pulls out the message from the user passes it to our assistant and it does all the magic and here you can try to dig through it it's it's quite complex and for those of you who ask me why I use repet for these kind of builds is because look at all of this I would much rather have this on a repet where I have full control over and I really understand the environment rather than trying to cram all of this into voice flow and do that multiple times in different stages in the app so I keep it all here because we can sort of tile ends make it look or pretty and then just access it through one simple um API endpoint and call this within voice flow so that's the chat functionality what we do is send off the thread ID that we created earlier so when we do this we're going to save the thread ID that we get back from the API and then we send it off with the last utterance which is what the user said uh so we send off the the user's message we send off the thread ID to our endpoint and it processes it and sends the AI response back which we save as the last response and then we come down here this is a little snippet that someone from my comment section gave to me instead of using a AI task to remove this we can actually just remove it using regular Expressions which is great he actually got it working so this is saving us on AI tokens which is an important thing that many of you brought up if you are using something like voice flow a lot of questions about yes they $50 but also the token cost if you go over because we have removed the AI task from this now you not going to be using the AI task down here which will save you a ton on token costs last but not least we take that trimmed response that's removed any of the citations because when you talk to the knowledge base sometimes it will send citations they look kind of ugly so we want to get rid of them then it's going to send that last response as the answer then it's going to loop back and wait for the next user response and it goes through this Loop kind of up here down here and back over and over and over again until the end of the conversation in order for us to test this we need to make sure that firstly we have changed our URLs over as I mentioned before so it should do USB or youve repet URL taken from here and with SL start on this one and then on this one it should be/ chat everything else should remain the same go back to your replate make sure it is running and everything is all good here this thing should say stop and there should be a little cursor here then we can click on the Run button on the right here and click run test how can I help you today um what are the best solar panels so I'm going to ask to the knowledge base and then we have it we're getting responses from the knowledge base while we're at it we can test the solar calculator features so let's go I want to calculate my savings so let's ask it and get it to sendback this is why they're so cool and so powerful these particular Systems Prior to this technology coming out and this new release getting these kind of interactions that are really natural and flexible between user and the AI was was quite difficult to say the least and look at this I can ask it about one of the tools to it has then it can come back to me and say sure these are the things I need and then if I just give it partial information it's going to be smart enough to ask me again for the rest of the information and then pull all of the information it needs out of multiple messages and send it away to our tools our functions our custom actions with an KN back in and then give us the answer so it's really amazing stuff here we can go could you please provide your address and your average monthly electricity bill so let's go uh get a new place here in Florida somewhere let's get this going maybe this one won't work but let's going really go bang and then it say I pay $350 per month now if you are watching this and you want to debug and understand what's happening I have set up print statements here so that you can see what's going on with the application uh while it's still doing the buffering now if we scroll down a bit here you can see that's the prior response here you can see it received message so that's us sending the message to the chatbot calculating solar potential oh where's it going calculating Sol potential for that address with bill amount 350 so it's taken it's passed through the message and it's pulled out the address and the bill amount so it's separate variables then it's converted that to coordinates you can see and then it's retrieved the solid data for that location successfully then we've simplified the data that we get back from the API and then we have the assistant response here which is really handy so that's printed out the exact response that get sent in here so if you come back you can see that we have the proper response here so seems like this guy has a $20,000 Federal incentive available to cost without solar will be $100,000 over 20 years the the API gives us back information about the cash purchase option Finance purchase option and leasing option and then gives a bit of a summary at the end um thanks to our our prompted assistant knowing what to do with the information and if you look carefully at the end here you can see that it is asking me for my information my name and phone number so that one of the team members can get in touch with you this is the lead capture step so all I need to do is go uh let's call myself uh Hugh Jackman phone number uh 301 9932 so it's going to take that name oh huge Jackman not huge Jackman oops forgive it a second yep thank you huge one of our team members will reach out to you shortly at the number you provided now we should see in our air table huge Jackin boom huge Jackin phone number and it's also pulled their address so that we have this information I did also want to add another column that was information so it could pull some of the savings data from the uh the output that we got from the solar calculator and use this to sort of fill out the lead information it could also take some of the information from the conversation say they asked a question about hey what's the best panels what's the best financing option we could get the AI to analyze the conversation the thread and pluck out the kind of questions or concerns that they might have so that we have some a little bit more data if our guys are going to go out and reach out to these people so okay we have the have the address we have the questions that we're asking we have the phone number we have the name a ton of good lead data and we also have a little status column here so say if I reach out to them we can go interested not interested Etc and then we have a working demo of our assistant within voice flow the last step now is to export this functionality to a website via a little embeddable script that we can add to any website which I'll show you in a second but if you are enjoying the video so far I'd really appreciate if you give me a like on this I put a ton of work into this to bring the latest and most exciting things that I can find that I'm working on right now and giving them away to you for free in the form of a tutorial and template as well so if you are enjoying want to support the Channel please leave like right now would mean a lot to myself and the community all righty now the last step we need to do is click on this Integrations tab on the left click here and you should see these three boxes pop up on the right here is an example of how it's going to look on a website so at the moment I'm happy with the styling I believe the styling should carry over when I export this template we have the installation script which we're going to grab in a second we have the general so I've got the name description I've got the chat persistance set to forget after tab is closed and reloaded just so that I can run through it a bunch of times you probably want to set it to never forget on the setting here but for the purposes of testing I'm going to leave it there then we have the appearance section so I've modified this a bit with the color logo Etc I'm pretty happy with that so we can click copy here and in this case I've got a demo website as I did in my recent video I've just pulled a free template off the internet somewhere that looks kind of similar to a Solar Company and all you need to do to add it into any website is to come down to the bottom and add it as a script tag so here I'll delete the old one at the bottom of most websites you should see a stack of these script tags all you need to do is sort of jump in between a couple of them just to be safe and then paste in that script tag there and we can save that I can run the website if I refresh it there you can see I have the web page and at the bottom right I have our chat bot and then we have it hi I'm Lucy Smith solar resistant I can help you with that we can test it again what are my financing options and then we have it we've got cash purchases loans and financing solar leases and power purchase agreements great we can go um my address is and then we can pull in this guys up here 5333 Schult street is and I pay $400 per month as expected it's giving us back the information we requested Federal incentive cost without solar um some of the leasing cash purchase and finance options Etc it's asking for my name and phone number so I can go um Bruce Willis and my phone error is 301 pop back over to air Table and there we go Bruce Willis with his address and his phone number has all been logged correctly into our air table CRM and there's one final thing that I want to mention about this kind of build which is by running it on repet like this and just running it within the editor you're only running a very basic and and limited server and and infrastructure to manage this application so what you can do within repet they actually have a deployment option so that you can go down on the bottom left here and click on deployments and it's going to be deployment options on the side side now you can pick whichever one you like to do you can follow through the setup so set up your deployment you can pick how much money you want to spend let's say we just go one machine uh we can go through essentially you can go through the steps here and fill this out and click on this deploy button then it's going to actually deploy your application to the servers that can run constantly that are going to allow you to call this whenever so when you're taking a two production grade there is another step required but in this video I want you guys to just be able to spin it up as quickly as possible if you want me to go in depth on deployments and how you can manage a production great application rather than just a demo or a prototype like this then let me know in the comments below and I can definitely get that out to you that's it for the build I hope you've been able to follow along I hope you see how insanely powerful these things are as a lead generation tool in this case also helping customers learn more about the business learn more about the products they selling and being able to flexibly use these different functions and pull in information from the chat is just so much better than the kind of stuff we've had to work with before prior to this assistance release getting some of this functionality was close to Impossible now we can do it in a couple of hours if you do enjoy these kinds of videos and want an a toz course on how you can create these kind of chatbots and assistance for your business or to sell to other businesses be sure to subscribe to the channel because I have a new video coming breaking down things step by step I know I went kind of fast on some parts of this but really the entire process for creating these functions step by step and I'm going to be using a ton of examples in this video so if you want to be in the loop and not miss that video be sure to subscribe to the Channel Down Below or if you can't wait for that you can join my AI business accelerator where we have some of the sharpest AI entrepreneurs in the space right now all moving on this opportunity and we're all sharing knowledge together sharing learnings plus I'm in there doing full workshops on this kind of stuff multiple times a week so if you want to get in there there'll be a link in the description for you to join the community of course as mentioned all templates and resources from this video are available in the description by my free resource Hub so you can head down there and check those out the reflet template The Voice flow template the air table template and the knowledge based document are all going to be there for you guys to take and copy this exact build in just a few minutes I also have my free telegram where I'm dropping daily information and learnings on the gpts topic so if you're not already in the telegram you can join that in the description as well if you want to learn more about how you can make money by selling these kind of GPT solutions to businesses you can check out my video here

              "text": "so you missed the make money with chat GPT Trend well good news a new chat GPT opportunity has just arrived and it's even bigger than last time open AI has just released their all new gpts product which is said to be the biggest opportunity in AI of 2024 these new and exciting gpts are already being adopted by the world's largest companies like Shopify Snapchat and canva who are placing their bits on a future dominated by these customized versions of chat GPT which should tell you something about where our world is headed the best part about this and the reason I'm making this video today is that anyone can get started and creating their own powerful gpts in just a few minutes and get in early on this new and exciting industry however as with any big announcement like this it can be hard to see through the hype and identify the real opportunities to make money I run two of my own AI companies that generate me over $100,000 per month in Revenue so I've personally had to go really deep on Research to to assess this opportunity and really plan my strategy moving forwards and in this video I'll be sharing with you the three biggest opportunities that I've identified for you to make money with gpts and I'll be giving you these step-by-step instructions on how you can take action on these opportunities today to get in on them early if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own sixf figure AI development company called Morningside Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI Solutions like gpts to businesses let's get started before we jump into the list I need to give you a quick crash course on what gpts are and what you need to know really before getting into this space firstly what are gpts open AI are calling gpts tailored versions of chat GPT and the idea here is that you can create fully customized versions of chat GPT that's perfectly tailored to your company or to your specific use case for example this guy made a GPT that is an AI yoga coach this guy made a GPT that is a luxury item authenticator that can check if your watch or designer bag is real or fake and this guy made a real estate data analyst that can calculate Roi on properties analyze market trends even advise on property listings and much more and even on this channel I've created my own gpts designed to be sales rep coaches for solar companies these kinds of gpts are just the first step towards allowing users and companies at large to build their own AI assistant either directly within the chat gbt interface or via the new assistant API this gpts release is such a big step and such a big opportunity because this idea of having a chat GPT on your business is by far the number one request that businesses have when they're working with development companies like myself this is all they ask for it's like I want chat gbt but with my business data so the fact that we now have this thing from open AI that we can build on top of and deliver these things to businesses is such a massive opportunity in order for you to take advantage of the gbt's opportunity you need to understand the three key ingredients that you can use to create powerful versions of at gbt specific to a certain use case it's best to think of these ingredients as the variables that you can control in order to Define what your gbt is what it does and and how it behaves the first ingredient is prompting so this is probably not rocket science for you guys by now prompting are the written instructions that you can provide to the AI to the assistant to tell it how to behave to tell it the kind of tone of voice to use to tell it what it can do so you're very familiar with this right now so I'll say that you got the prompting thing down so far the second ingredient is knowledge yes you can now add your own files to the AI for it to draw from when it's creating its answers so you can give it PDFs you can give it docs you can give it csvs most data types are Now supported so you can provide this additional knowledge to your GPT to use and generating its answers and the third ingredient is actions yes you can now use open ai's existing capabilities like darly or browser Bing or the code interpreter but you can also add your own custom capabilities or actions that the AI perform the theory behind these custom actions can get a little bit complex but for now just think of it as additional things I can allow my assistant to do allow my GPT to do that can do things in the real world so I might give it some information it might process that it might interact with my database and I might pull things better so those kind of actions that allow it to do things outside of just answering from a knowledge base or answering from the regular chat gbt answering engine so those are the three ingredients that you can use when creating your gpts we have prompting knowledge and actions and of course different combinations of these three ingredients will create very different specialized gpts built for different use cases so you as the Builder I like a chef and you get to pick and mix the ingredients you want and the amounts and that can create a a recipe or create a separate outcome in terms of a specialized GPT for a specific use case or function with that Foundation laid we are ready to get into the first way of making money that I've identified which is to build gpts for the GPT store as part of the gpts announcement open AI announced that they are launching their marketplace where people can create and list gpts that they create so you get to be the shift you get to put these different things together and then you get to put it up onto the market Marketplace for people to buy or access or use the key Point here is that they have promised Revenue sharing for popular gpts which could be a lucrative opportunity if you're some of the first people to get onto this Marketplace and start building but there are two things you need to be aware of before you get stuck into this opportunity firstly you need to be aware of the kind of forecast on how this Marketplace is likely going to operate in the first couple of months at least there's going to be an explosion of activity on this Marketplace which is going to rapidly fill out basically any low hanging fruit and any gpts that can easily be created with a public data set or a public API basically anything like a crypto price tracker or any of these really low hanging fruit these are going to be made and commoditized very very quickly so in order for you to be able to make any long-term money from this you need to be able to create gpts that other people can't necessarily copy that easily so as a rule of thumb if you can make it in 10 minutes someone else can likely make it in 10 minutes as well so you need to be smart about how you create the gpts on top of what they are created so private data sets or private apis types of data or ways of accessing data that is not available to everyone will allow you to create a GPT that not everyone can compete with you on and you have the sort of Monopoly over that kind of data if you can find these kinds of private data or private apis that other people will pay to get access to then you have a defensible position and you can start to make long-term money from your gpts on the platform secondly you need to be aware that open AI is basically getting the community to find their future product launchers for them many expect open AI to pull an Amazon style move with this Marketplace and they'll just be skimming the winners of the Top by integrating the best and most popular functionality on the marketplace into their own Solutions and they've already done this with the knowledge bases and things like this this is basically an Amazon style move because Amazon when they see products that are selling like hot cakes on Amazon they then Source the product themselves and then they start making their own listings and then they rank those listings sort of as they wish within the search results you can expect open AI to do the same thing here so if you win big on the market place you could well be wiped out in the next update which is why I prefer these sort of next two opportunities that I'm going to be covering in this video basically it's not that defensible or sustainable in my opinion my recommended strategy to start making money on the open AI Marketplace is to firstly start creating gpts you need to roll up your sleeves get your hands dirty and start building these things and doing it often you need to learn how different data types can be used in the knowledge base to do different things you need to get familiar with creating custom actions the entire Shang you need to be really familiar with it so that you know how to create these things moving forward I've actually already done a video showing you how you can set up custom knowledge and custom actions in your GPT so if you want want to watch that and get started you can click on that up here it's important to note that monetization and revenue sharing is not yet enabled on the platform but you need to be able to become an expert now so that you're first to the scene and ready to start making money with these and putting out some high quality gpts step two is to build your developer reputation open AI has developer profiles on the marketplace so if you can establish yourself early as a good Builder you can set yourself up for long-term success by building that reputation now and step three is to find unique data sets in order to escape competition as mentioned to create long-term value you need to create gpts that no one else can and this starts with finding data that others can't get access to if you like a video on this specific topic of finding sort of hidden data to create valuable gpts let me know in the comments and I can put a video together that's my strategy for making money on the open AI Marketplace it's not my favorite out of the three these other two are definitely more up my alley and I think it more defensible long term which brings us to opportunity number two which is to build custom gpts for businesses in my opinion the real money in this gpts Gold Rush will be made by helping businesses to create and Implement their own gpts I've even created an entire business model around this opportunity called the AI automation agency which is where we basically help businesses to implement AI technology and as the new updates come out like what we've just seen you help them to implement that as well in my opinion the gpts on the store and the marketplace are cool but the real value is going to be created through What's called the assistant API where you can create powerful assistance for businesses that can be built into their systems and run program atically without a a human having to be able to talk to it and operate it these kinds of assistants or gpts that are built on the assistant API rather than through the chat gbt site is a a completely different ball game and one is for consumers and one is for businesses and Industrial grade applications which is why I say that this side where the assistant API is is going to be where the majority of the value is Created from this technology and from this update studying an AI agency like this is in my opinion the smartest move long term as by specializing in AI agent Solutions and specifically gpts you're ensuring that you're on the Forefront of this technology and you can constantly adapt and update your offering to include the latest updates from open a so meaning you get consistent new Revenue by upselling clients whenever there's a new update that comes out so you build them the assistant it's working great and then a new update comes out and you say well these new features we can just plug those in to the existing system that we've created for you the key here then is to be able to plan create and sell tailored GPT solutions to businesses I've even got a video showing you exactly how you can create a GPT using the assistance API that I just mentioned and then put that onto a website so that you can sell that as a service or product to businesses so if you are interested in creating an agency and selling solutions to businesses I check that video out up here it is really really cool I've also got a complete guide on how you can sell gpts to businesses so if you're not already subscribed then subscribe for that because that's coming very soon my recommended strategy for making money with this opportunity is to firstly learn how to put gpts on websites that's just what I've mentioned in that video there it'll also be linked in the description but this is the first and most obvious solution or product or service that you can sell to businesses step two is that you need to pick a niche so for example you might say we build gpts for coaching businesses it's important that you narrow your scope down to a specific type of person you might try a whole bunch of them initially but you do need to pick a specific person to be contacting and telling them what you can build for them step three is that you need to start reaching out to businesses and offering a free build a free chatbot or even doing a free AI audit of their business to identify where gpts can benefit their business business and step four is that once you've done your Audits and your free builds then you can start charging for the services that you're providing to other clients it's definitely the simplified version on how to create one of these AI agencies but if you do want to learn more and and move on this opportunity as soon as possible you can join my AI business accelerator which is going to be linked in the description inside my community you can learn step by step how to create one of these businesses and get access to coaches and resources and tools Etc that opportunity wrapped up we can get stuck into our third and final opportunity which is to specialize in GPT strategy and devel velopment as a freelancer before we get into the third one if you are enjoying the video can you please hit down below and leave a like would really help me in my channel and the community out a lot and also if you're down there subscribe if you enjoy this kind of AI business content as that's the focus of this channel back to the video the opportunity to specialize in GPT strategy and development as a freelancer it's really just a logical step from the opportunity we just mentioned which is that there's going to be hundreds of agencies popping up to specialize in GPT development for businesses so there's going to be huge demand for people and Freelancers who can actually use the assistant API effectively and it's really a a sell the shovels approach similar to the agency model at the end of the day there's going to be all of these agencies going out of finding all of these clients but they going to need to hire people or contract out to people who can actually create the assistance and use the assistance API to build the solutions now people keep saying that coding is dead and will be wiped out soon while longterm I think that yes it will largely become handled by AI until then I see becoming even more valuable than ever as developers can increasingly build insanely powerful assistance and just a few outs the input to Output ratio is is going through the roof when you're a developer who's enhanced by AI my recommended strategy for making money with this opportunity is firstly to learn basic Python and JavaScript now some of you might be rolling your eyes right now and saying coding's dead I'm just talking from my own experience I build these things with the assistant API I've been building AI software for the past year in my experience knowing how to write Python and and JavaScript code has been hugely valuable and allowed me to do basically anything and build anything I wanted to when it's assisted by chat gbt step two is to start building assistance so use your python knowledge to go and use the assistance API to start creating some of these gpts programmatically and really flexing your skills and getting familiar with what you can build and how to use the knowledge component the tools component Etc and step three is to actually join my community you can join my free community you can join my paid Community but inside there is where you're going to be able to list yourself and list your services as an assistant expert developer for gpts so that you can start to find your first clients and get your first work as a freelancer because in my community there are thousands of agency owners who are going out and getting in front of businesses and telling them that they can build them certain things essentially the people who are running agencies within the community go out and find clients and then when they need it actually delivered they come to people like you and contract out the delivery so that's how the whole ecosystem Works in my community if you want to join my PID Community that's in the description and then my Discord link for the free community is also in the description and finally step four is to build your personal brand as a GPT specialist so those means creating your website maybe even creating your YouTube or starting to post on LinkedIn starting to put yourself out there and say these are are the kind of things I've done and this is how I can help you and there you have it those are the three biggest opportunities that I see to make money with gpts right now if you've enjoyed this video and want to stay in the loop on the latest updates regarding gpts and how to build a valuable business in this new industry be sure to subscribe to the channel down below if you haven't already I have a ton more content coming that you do not want to miss so I'm actually working on a complete guide to building gbts so that you have the skills you need to crush this opportunity in 2024 and Beyond so subscribe below for that and while you're down there please leave a like on this video it really helps me in my channel a lot and also if you aren't already a part of my free Telegram and want to get daily updates on this gpts opportunity and my learnings as I continue to explore things further that's going to be linked in the description so you can join there for some daily value and finally if you are interested in learning how to create a custom GPT via the assistants API and put it on a website you can click here this is the video I mentioned earlier in the video but aside from that thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'll be showing you step by step the fastest way to add your custom gpts to any website this has been a highly requested video because many of you have created awesome gpts in the Builder but you want to break them out of the chat GPT site and start using them in the real world unfortunately a lot of people don't understand the enormous value of gpts because they are missing a key part of open ai's Vision that no one is talking about right now so by the end of the video you'll not only know exactly how to put your gpts onto websites but you'll also understand exactly how open AI has really laid out the path for all of us to build and sell gpts that integrate into every part of our world so that you can pounce on this incredible new opportunity before others catch on if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I run my own sixf figure AI development company called Morningside Ai and I also run the largest community of AI agency owners in the world where my students learn how to make money by selling AI solutions to businesses just like the website chatbot that you're about to build let's get into it the first thing that you need to understand before getting stuck into building this is the difference between the gpts that you can build on the chat GPT website and the gpts that you can build with open ai's assistance API the gpts that you can create on the chat GPT site are best understood as consumer toys they are cool little gimmicky things that allow people to come on and do this like setup experience where they can add some knowledge and build these gpts and put them on a Marketplace but you need to understand that that is is sort of one area and one side of this entire equation the other side is the assistant AP I and the real powerful assistance that you can create and operate programmatically so the chbt ones that you build on the chat gbt website cannot be operated programmatically you can set them up you can save them in your little sidebar but you can't actually start to call those programmatically which is why you watching this video because you don't know how to take that functionality and put it elsewhere that's what the assistant API is for this is the business facing product so we have the consumer side then we have the business facing side of this this gpt's product and that is created through through the assistant API what the assistant API allows you to do is all of the things you do on the on the chat gbt Builder side of things but allows you to set things up programmatically and then once you have created an assistant with this which I'm going to show you in this video Once youve created that assistant you can then make calls to it in the same way that you used to make calls to the chat gbt API you can create your assistant you can give it knowledge you can give it functions and once that's created you can call that assistant and ask for responses from it and use those within your application so what we're doing in this video is creating assistant using the assistant's API that I've templated all for you guys to copy so you don't have to worry about writing code but we'll create an assistant we'll connect it to a chatbot builder then we're going to be able to take that and put it onto a website that's going to be accessible through a little chat bubble widget that you're probably used to by now for anyone who is looking to make the most of this opportunity that is gpts you need to understand the assistance API and how this is going to be used in real word applications and don't get too distracted by this gpts thing and and the GPT store and stuff like that well it might be great the real value and real impact of the gpts release will be created through this assistant API which you're going to get a crash course on now but that out of the way we can get into exactly what we are building today and how so we are creating a custom knowledge chatbot and in this case the custom knowledge chatbot is going to be a a sales rep training assistant so we're going to give it custom knowledge on training documentation for our business so that the sales reps and the junior sales reps in particular can talk to this chatbot to get information about the business on what offers they can sell how much things cost what methods they should use Etc so custom chatbot and we're going to be taking that functionality creating it with the assistant's API and then putting that onto a website with a little bubble in the corner that can be interacted with the actual implementation of this is going to consist of two parts we are going to create this functionality by firstly creating a repet that creates our assistance for us and manages the conversations back and forth and then we're going to connect that repa to voice flow as our front end so we're going to make API calls from voice flow to our repet and so they can talk back and forth with each other and then we can start getting our conversations through a nice chat interface that anyone can use on our website to get started you need to clone my repet as always I've done all of the code and I've written everything for you so you can just plug and play my repet and copy it and you can get up and running in a couple of minutes so it's going to be available in the first link in the description you'll be able to sign up to my resource Hub and then inside the resource Hub you'll be able to find a link to this repet once you're on the screen you can go up to the top right and click this Fork button then we can call it uh gpt2 website and just save it there we can Fork this it's going to create a copy of everything that I've done once it loads in you should see this screen here I'm going to take you through a quick tour of how I've set this up so you're fully aware of what's going on without needing to do any changes or modifications so in this case I have my knowledge document that I've uploaded it looks like a tool scr here but the machine can understand it I've uploaded my knowledge document which is the training information for uh the solar business and the salip is going to be able to chat and back and forth with so I've uploaded the knowledge document here you have the main.py file where we have our API endpoints that we'll be able to talk to from voice flow so there's one here to start the conversation and create a new thread then there's one that we'll send our user queries off to to process and send back to us so I won't get stuck in the weed here too much you can take a look over it as you'd like or even paste this into the chat GPT and ask it for some help breaking down and understanding how this works that might be a good learning experience for you as well but the high level of it is that we have this create assistant function here and when we run this app for the first time it's going to look in this left hand column here and see if there's a file called assistants. Json if there isn't one it's going to create you a new assistant based off these instructions here so this is the Smith solar sales assistant and I have the instructions for it here so these are the instructions that you have when you put into the GPT Builder on the chat GPT website this is the prompting and sort of explanation of what it's supposed to do if you are following along but you want to do it differently with your own use case this is what you need to modify so you can change the information here to prompt it into a different role here I have set up the retrieval tool so if you want to have a custom knowledge base and add in a document like I have you just need to leave this as is so that's the retrieval sort of knowledge retrieval feature and then what this function is going to do is send all of that information off to the assistant API create a new assistant up in the up in The Ether and it's going to return back the ID for that assistant and we're going to save that assistant into a file on the leftand panel here called assistant. Json and that's going to save the ID so that we can later recall it and every time you run this over again you won't need to create a new assistant which is going to cost you a lot in API usage so it's going to store that assistant ID and it's going to reload that every time when you restart this application so it's going to save you a ton of money all you need to do to get this thing up and running out is to go to the bottom left to secrets and you'll see open AI API key up on the right here you need to go to open ai's website and either create or get your existing key come back here and hit the edit button and paste in your API key and save it and then we should be good to go and run this thing for the first time now if I click on the Run button here it's going to boot everything up and it's going to create the assistant because there's no assistant. Json in the left hand panel here so you should see assistant. Json appears great I'm not going to open it up because you'll see my assistant key but inside that file is going to be the ID of the assistant that you just created with those settings so with the prompting settings that you gave it and with that knowledge base you've created a new assistant that it's up there ready for you to talk to in future next we need to create the chatbot that allows us to interact with our system programmatically via the API endpoints that we have set up on our rep we're going to be using as my favorite bot building platform called voice flow which is something I use daily at my AI development company as well so this stuff is really solid and I really back it for you guys to learn how to use this as well the link to sign up to voice flow will be available in the description so then once you're here you can log in and create an account and then once you're inside what you're going need to do is download the template file that I've created for you it's going to be available in the resource Hub in the description so again go down to the description you can sign up to my resource up and inside will be the repet template there'll also be the voice flow template as well so you need to go in there download that file and then come back even if you're not copying exactly the use case that I'm doing there is still a very good base for you guys to be able to plug in any kind of assistance apis that you want to into these kind of custom custom fronti and and chat Bots you can put on website so once you've downloaded that you come back here and you can click the import. VF file up in the top right right and then obviously load in the file that you've just downloaded we can click open assistant on the right here and just like that you've got all of the work that I've done already for you that allows you to just plug and play the ret functionality into this voice one just to take you through what this chatot does firstly we have a get request to our start URL if we go back to replate you can see we have in our main.py file we have our app rot which is start and what this is going to do is sort of initialize the conversation and create a new thread so under your assistant you have threads which are basically conversations threads all just store memory and retrieve it later on so whenever we start a new conversation we need to create a new thread and that's what this is doing here we are going to create a get request and then we're going to save the thread ID and every time the user sends a message to the chatbot we're able to take the thread ID that we created at the start of the conversation then we're able to take the message as well and send all of that off to our chat endpoint which again if you go back to the main file we have the chat one here so we have the start conversation with create to thread then we have the chat inpoint which is going to generate a response I know that might te complexs for you but I promise this as soon as you get this repet template set up you're able to make these little tweaks and you get this running then this is going to be very easy for you to sort of understand how this whole system works so we actually very close to seeing this in action now all we need to do is go back to repet and on the right side here you'll see this web view that popped up if you click on the new tab button here on the right it will pop up in a new window and it will give you the URL the address of where your server is currently running so we can copy this and go over to voice flow again and now we just need to update the URLs in our request so we can replace entire thing paste this in here and this one needs to be slash start start so your URL and then it should be SL start so this is the start conversation and then here if I paste this in here again and go/ chat those are the two different endpoints that we need to be calling all of this should be set up and ready for you to go now all we need to do to test this is Click On The Run button up in the top right if I click run test it's going to allow me to start the chat with our assistant so hi I'm Dale Smith solar Sal rep assistant how can I help you today um what discounts do we we have available and this is a question about some of the information that is in the source material that I provided so we'll see what it comes back with great at Smith solo we have various discounts available early be discount referral discount cash discounts Etc as we can see it is outputting from my custom knowledge base I can even ask it another question I can say uh what are our finance options and test it again at the moment these assistant API calls run quite slow so if you want to keep an eye on how this is actually the process and progress of the the call in the back end what you can do is come back over to repet and whenever you run it you'll see in this bottom right hand corner where it's it's logging what it's doing so okay I received a request to create a new thread okay I created the thread here's the ID okay now I'm in the process of generating an answer I'm in progress and progress and progress run completed here's the answer so if you need any help debugging what's going on or any issues that are happening I've written this code in a way that allows you to see what's happening in real time time within the console here so just a handy tip for you if you need any help where you run into any issues since we have the functionality working nicely here in voice flow we are good to take this and put it onto our website now which is super easy one of the reasons I love voice flows because of this functionality as go all I need to do is click on the publish button in the top right I don't need to give it a name wait for it to publish and now I can click on this embed widget settings on the screen we have three parts firstly the installation which is the code that we're going to put on the website in a second but then you can also modify the appearance of it so you can see on the right I've made it look kind of nice already and on brand with a kind of Solar Company I've called it Smith solar assistant and I put a description here which of these two things here and then I've also customized the appearance with some coloring and I've put a little logo thing on it as well so it looks quite nice I think it's fairly on brand for a Solar Company might look like all I need to do now is copy this code and take it over to the website for the sake of this tutorial I've just downloaded a website template off the internet so that I can show you what this looks like in action this is a website code don't need to look at any of it really this this is going to be your website code or the website code that you want to put this chatot onto need to scroll down to the bottom of the the main file whichever it may be and just before the end in the sort of script section you should see a bunch of different scripts here you can just paste it in between some of these so I can paste that in there then my JavaScript code that puts that little bubble on the website is now installed I can save this file I can click this and run a live preview and we'll see what it looks like so here's the template website I've just pulled off the internet but in the bottom right hand corner you can see there is the Bubble Up it pops Smith solar assistant hi male Smith solar sales R how can I help you today um what uh are our financing options and there we have it a working custom GPT using our own knowledge base put onto a website using voice flow and repet and using the assistant API this is only just scratching the surface of what is possible with the assistance API for this video I actually had to take out a ton of features to keep it as simple and straightforward to explain as possible I'm actually going to be releasing a full length tutorial going into depth on everything related to the assistant API and how you can build gpts for businesses and start selling them to really start making money and capitalizing on this new opportunity before everyone else wakes up to what I've just shown you in this video so if you want to be a part of that you want to stay in the loop make sure you subscribe to the channel because I have a ton more content like this coming that shows you how to make money from this new technology and if you want to join my AI business accelerator where I'm teaching my community and my students how to make money with this opportunity and with this exact same thing you've seen in this video you can join that in the link in the description as well remember if you want free access to all of the resources mentioned here the riplet template the knowledge based document and also the voice flow template is all going to be available in the first link in the description on my resource Hub which is completely free and if you're not already in my free telegram I'm dropping a ton of game in there on this exact topic and everything related to GPT so if you want to get some free value and free game on what we're doing here you can get access to my Telegram in the description as well if you're interested in learning more about my thoughts on the gpt's release and what it means for AI businesses you can take a look at the video which is available here but aside from that thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be showing you from start to finish how you can create a powerful custom GPT using a knowledge and a custom action component within open ai's new gpts I'll also be giving away my template so that you can create your own custom GPT functionality just as easily as I am okay so here we are on the homepage of chat GPT we can jump straight into creating my own GPT with the create button here now I'm going to go to the configure section because I think we are big big boys and girls and we can get started with this so I'm going to call my GPT Smith's solar sales assistant and then I'm going to give a description a sales rep assistant for a Solar Company Smith's solar so this is just a a fantasy company that I've created for the purpose of the tutorial then we need to write the instructions so I've just pasted in a prompt that I wrote earlier but I blow this up here for you guys to see the assistant Smith solar sales assistant has been programmed to help junior sales reps with Learning Company standard operating procedures as a salesperson the assistant is also able to provide the size of a client's roof which will be sent off to our solar calculator custom action which will return some valuable estimation data for the customer to help them make their decision the system will focus on ensuring that the CRM reflex is updates accurately and promptly a document has been provided with the information on Smiths solar sales processes and training information so I've got a document prepared that I can then go down to the knowledge section and I can upload this document solar sales rep training one this is going to be available in my resource Hub so if you want to follow along with this you can go down to the first link in the description sign up and get access to this document and the prompt and some of the code that I'm going to show you later so upload that give it a second to upload we can leave all of these on then I want to go to to this section where it says add actions now this is where it gets really exciting because we get to add a custom action this might seem a little bit Advanced for some of you but I promise I'll try to simplify this down as much as possible so the custom action that I want to enable this GPT to be able to do is for the sales rep to not only be asking questions from the knowledge base about how do I update the CRM what do I do how do I sell these products all the sort of informational knowledge related things I also wanted to be able to do cool functions for these reps so the example that I want to use within this tutorial is sort of a solar calculator tool where the sales rep can be meeting with a client they can say okay how much are you paying currently for your power bill okay how big is your roof and then I can send that over to my GPT it's going to send that to our API it's going to process that data and it's going to give back some really valuable information estimation that they can pass on to the client so really cool tool I've actually built this already you guys are going to be able to copy all of this so if you're following along and want to add this custom functionality to your GPT as well all you need to do is go to my resource Hub Link in the description which is where the sales training documents for the knowledge base are going to be as well as a link to this repet and so when you come on here you might need to sign up the repet but what you can do is come on and click this Fork button and then I can call it Liam Fork template and I can Fork this Ripple what this is going to do is give you all of the code that I've written um for this back end to handle that logic to calculate the the solar estimations you don't need to look at it too much it's all basically good to go all you can do is click this run button and then once it's up and running you should see this little window here then you can click on the new tab button and it's going to open this up in a new tab and you need to keep that tab open there cuz we're going to come back to it in a second then we can go back to our gpts Builder and then in the schema area we're going to paste in the code snippet that I'm going to provide on my resource Hub so again you can go to the resource Hub this entire block of code is going to be there so this is going to explain to your GPT how you can use that functionality that we provided and what sort of inputs it needs to give to it and what kind of outputs it can expect back so we can go back and copy the URL to this page not found then we come back into this section and we can paste this over the old URL and I'm going to delete the backslash at the end so it should have read all of that inform and got it added down here where it says get and calculate then we can go back to this and we're pretty much all ready to go I'm going to click here I'm going to use Dolly to generate an image for it and I'm not going to put any conversation starters because I don't think we need it just yet and then give it a second and we should be ready to start testing this and show you the custom functionality and the knowledge base that we've created here with our knowledge base document added our custom action information set up and our replot running in the background we are ready to start testing this thing so I can say hi I can first ask it what offers do we have to get a a sale Over The Line This is is clearly a knowledge based focused question it's going to look into see what incentives we have in our training documentation so yep it's got it exactly right we have the early bird discount we have a bunch of other things again you guys can get this document on my resource Hub which is available in the description so you can follow along seem to Ace that question so we can go on to asking it our custom action related tasks so a roof is 12 me wi and the family spends 450 per month on power so it should trigger our action here talking to the repet which is great we can allow it talk to it let's make sure it's sent the right of off yep and there we go it sent it off to our repet here it's done all the processing again you can steal all this code off me you don't have to write it yourself and it's giving us back a really really powerful and useful set of insights and calculations that we can pass over to the customer on the spot and when you're done with building a GPT as we are we can hit save I'm going to go only me and I can confirm this here and then I get access to it within the chat GPT window here and I can do the exact same thing hi how do I use the company and there you have it that's how you can create a custom GPT that not only uses custom knowledge but also uses custom actions that we've set up using riplet as our place to host that code so I hope you can see all the possibilities that come out of this I do want to go more in depth in this in a later video but obviously want to keep this one short if you want to watch the continued sort of Extended Cut tutorial of this I will be releasing that in the next day or two so if you aren't already subscribed to the channel make sure you subscribe to the channel and as I said all of the resources that I've just mentioned are going to be available in the description so you can get onto my resource Hub get all the resources and if you're excited about the opportunity that gpts presents to us and want to sort of stay in the loop on how you can start to build businesses and make money with these you'll also want to join my telegram which is in the description where I'm posting daily updates sort of new tips and tricks on how I'm building these and how I'm continuing to add cool custom functionality that provides real value to businesses as I've just done here so thanks for watching that's all for the video and I will see you in the next [Music] one"

              "text": "so this new open AI announcement might have just killed the AI automation agency as we know it and unfortunately it completely changes the landscape of AI business and really all of the work that we've done up until now is basically wasted so I might be taking a break from YouTube for a while I don't even know psych sorry to clickbait you with that one but the fact that you click shows you are worried about these recent updates so you should probably be watching this video anyway now these new open AI announcements have shaken up the AI world to say the least and they have massive ramifications for our businesses as AI automation agency owners the question is now whether or not we can adapt to survive in this new environment and what new opportunities we have to capitalize on from them as someone who is running multiple successful businesses in the AI space right now I'm paying very close attention to the news and have been speaking to really the smartest people that I know about all of these recent updates so in this video I'll be sharing with you what I have learned over the past 24 hours starting with a breakdown of the most important parts of the open AI div day announcement what they mean for AI automation agency owners or really anyone looking to build a business in the AI space and also at the end of the video I'll be throwing in how you can get access to my gpt's 101 resource which I'm outlining my full strategy on how to dominate this new industry so that you can start making money from this as soon as humanly possible now the most important part of the div day announcements was of course the release of gpts which are custom versions of chat GPT these gpts are really the first step towards allowing users and companies at large to build their own AI assistance directly within the chat GPT interface the idea with gpts is that you can create a customized version of chat GPT that is perfectly tailored to your own product or company now this may sound familiar because this is basically what every company has been asking for and looking for for the past couple of months is like how can I have chat GPT but with my own data and that's suited to my business now the way open AI is going about creating these G gpts is using what I'll call Four ingredients and these are things that you can add in to create your custom GPT and the first one of those is prompting now prompting is is nothing rocket science for you guys at this point but basically the written instructions that you give to your GPT in terms of how it's supposed to behave how it can engage with the users the tone of voice it can use what it can and can't do things like that all through natural language so there's nothing really that new there now the second ingredient that we can add into our GPT is a knowledge component yes this is something we have all been trying to do with our own chatbots in many different ways with Victor databases and customer knowledge bases with all these different platforms now we have it built into the gpt's platform and the Builder as well so open AI has sort of eaten up all of these different services and and businesses and SAS products that have popped up to allow you to extend the knowledge of your of your chat GPT API core now they have built it inhouse really brought it into the solutions offering for these gpts so you can upload documents you can upload csvs all sorts of things then you could have that as your custom Modge base for your GPT you know this is all Native and built in and this is going to really simplify the process for you adding knowledge to your AI agents in a major way the third ingredient you can add to your GPT is memory now this is a much improved form of memory over what we're used to using instead of just using the basic sort of recent five messages open AI has started to implement long-term memory via threading which is something I can't go into this video it's a bit more complex but essentially it's a longer term form of memory that's going to make your agents and assistants even more powerful and the final ingredient and the most exciting of all is of course actions actions are things that you can allow your GPT to be able to do uh this can be things like call zaps and and do things via zap here but more importantly you can add any kind of custom functionality and custom function and make that available to your GPT to be able to do sort of external functionality and actually do things in the real world so what gpts allows you to do is to pick and mix all of these different ingredients and combine them into your own custom chat GPT experience that can do certain things and behaves in a specific way now another major announcement that the D day conferen you should be aware of is that gp4 got a massive upgrade up to 128,000 tokens they've made it faster they've made it cheaper they've apparently made it smarter as well over a larger contact window so expect a big upgrade on GPT 4 as well and finally open AI released GPT Vision which allows us to do a ton of cool things with language models and images now with all of these new updates what does this actually mean for people like you and I who are running AI agencies well at the end of the day this hasn't actually changed the underlying opportunity that we built our agencies and our businesses on top of which is helping businesses to integrate this new technology facilitating the adoption of AI technology into the world into the businesses Etc at the end of the day this has just made our job easier on the delivery side because it simplified a lot of the things that we were already doing but we're having to use all these different third party platforms to do so by open AI integrating knowledge into the systems by integrating action and all these sort of things that we were already trying to do they just simplify the service delivery and the idea Remains the Same we're still doing the same things the tools have just changed and in my opinion the tools have gotten better and and really benefited us as agency owners who are implementing these Solutions now to be fully transparent like many of you when I first heard that news of all of these new updates and how was completely changing the industry I did get that kind of sick feeling in my stomach where I was like oh like the human beings don't like change it's it's no secret and when we get hit by a curveball it doesn't feel nice and it's okay to to feel that way but it's important to um give yourself a bit of time to to soak it in and do your research and come up to speed on what this opportunity is and if you're like me you'll be seeing that this is actually a massive opportunity for us and it's really the one that we have been waiting for us as AI automation agency owners we've already been doing a lot of the stuff we already understand it this is really the opportunity we've been waiting for to simplify a lot of the difficult parts of running these businesses so I think we are the perfectly positioned group of people to really be the first to the scene here and be the first to start making massive money by fac facilitating the adoption of this gpts technology there will be ludicrous amounts of money made with these considering that the entire world basically needs to adopt these at some point so again there's a massive market for this stuff and we are the first to the scene to be able to make the most of this opportunity and start to make money from selling these things and implementing it another concern that you may be having is that these look so easy to set up on stage where can I as an agency owner actually provide value how can I charge people for this when they can set them up themselves on stage in 30 seconds uh it's really the same as it's always been which is knowledge Gap people need to know how to implement these into their business in the ways that work and provide the most value for them there's still a ton of info that you need to know in order to be able to start put this into practice into businesses and more so there's the creation of all of these custom actions for businesses that can do all sorts across the business on websites Etc and there massive place where you can still continue to create value now all within the confines of open AI environment which gives us some kind of permanence at least for maybe the next year in terms of how this is going to be rolled out to business businesses we have this environment to do all of this in and I think it's important to note that while zapia might look cool in the demos and be like wow zapia can do everything well they need custom coded stuff and why would they need custom functions to be made zapia is only good for these little things these like little personal assistant kind of things if you're actually doing large scale operations in a business where you're connecting to a database where you're connecting to a website and doing like actual real and and more valuable tasks you are still going to need to develop some kind of solution and create custom functions for that for these different gpts and honestly I would not be surprised to see huge demand open up for GPT specific agencies to specialize in setting up and managing complete GPT systems for businesses so this is like retainer kind of territory where you could charge3 4 $5,000 per month to a business to set up and then consistently build functionality across the business and continue to improve their gpts for the business it's like you're an agency specialized on just gpts development for businesses so that really Narrows the scope down to what you can do for a business if you want I can do a full video on this idea around G DPT specific agency so if you want me to do that just let me know in the comments below now what can we learn from this recent shake up and how can we use it to predict sort of future events within the AI space I think it's probably fair to say that open AI will continue to eat up this new tech that's built outside of their own gates in the open source community and stuff like all of the uh custom knowledge based technology and things like this they've just consumed that up and brought that into the sort of In-House functionality and Native functionality of the gpts I think we'll continue to see that moving forward as find these limitations of the technology they will hit those limitations people will try to build around it and they'll probably pull all the best ideas in and continue to advance their technology by doing that sort of iteratively over time and and from this you really need to keep in mind that going too far beyond what's sort of the latest and greatest in the space can leave you Overexposed by committing too many resources to really hacking your way around to get these models to do things that they aren't yet capable of doing because you're going to spend all this time and energy and resources to create that stuff that's likely just going to be wiped out when open AI comes out with a solution of their own and the second thing we can gather from what samman was saying at the conference is that open AI is looking to warm the world up towards this concept and towards this future of autonomous AI agents and that's really looking to be rolled out in the next year so what we are in is really phase one right now with gpts being their way of getting people used to using AI assistance that can help them to do different things now the next stage of this is going to be likely multiple different agents being able to communicate with each other which is enti different ball game of its own so what we really need to be focusing on as AI automation agency owners is that business owners need to be prepared in advance for this new future that's coming out likely next year so there's more reason than ever for these businesses to be keeping up to date with setting up their own gpts and things like this because they can't jump from zero having no AI set up no assistance no agents anything set up within the business all the way to this autonomous agent future with all of them talking together they can't jump from that in the space of a couple couple of months it's going to need to be gradual and if they are not moving now they're going to be left high and dry which is great for you selling your services because there's very much a need for them to keep up to date and if they don't then they're going to be really on the back foot in the industry which is not where they want to be and so finally how can you start moving on this opportunity right now firstly if you haven't already subscribed to the channel you should definitely do that first because I'm going to posting a lot of information on how I'm navigating my AI businesses through this massive shift and how I'm pivoting them to to really make the most of this new opportunity so if you want to be getting all of my sort of latest learnings and and tips for how you can make the most of this then you definitely want to be subscribed so you don't miss out on future videos and why you down there leave a like if this has been helpful please that'll be a big help the second thing you need to be doing to make sure you're on the front foot of this opportunity is to start building your first gpts within the open AI Playground now this is already available I'm going to be showing you exactly how to do it in a video that's coming out likely in a day or so after posting this so if you don't want to miss that also make sure you subscribe to the channel because I'll be showing you just how easy it is to start start creating your own gpts and getting really familiar with how they work and finally a lot of this Ai and GPT stuff might not seem that farfetched to us right now but other businesses and business owners have absolutely no clue what is going on so your job is still to be the bridge that connects them to be able to understand and implement this new technology and that starts with you understanding this stuff yourself so you need to go out there do your research watch a bunch of other videos get in there and start building your own gpts you need to understand the stuff yourself to ensure you're on the front foot can start helping businesses to facilitate the adoption of it so go do your own research and stay up to date on this as much as you can for those of you who are interested in a deeper dive on this topic I've actually just recorded and posted a new video with my CTO Spencer getting his thoughts as an expert AI developer on these updates which is available on my second channel for Morningside AI which will be linked Below in the description so if you want to check that out and hear a deeper discussion of things it's going to be available down there and for those of you who have stuck around to the end of the video to get access to my gpt's 101 resource detailing my Zac steps and really strategy to make the most out of this opportunity that's going to be available in my free Discord and my telegram which are both linked down below so you can join those and get access and really join the biggest community of aspiring AI business owners on Earth so if you want to get in their Network meet other people really stay on the Forefront then my community is the absolute best place to do that but that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next [Music] one"

              "text": "this is Connor and Connor they own an email marketing agency and today I'm going to help them to supercharge their business with AI there's been a lot of talk lately that making money with AI is just a scam so today I wanted to prove that selling AI solutions to businesses is not only possible for entrepreneurs like you and I but also extremely valuable to the businesses who adopt them firstly we're going to be investigating their business to identify the current problems that are facing secondly I'm going to be showing you my entire Planning and Building process to create power AI solutions for businesses before finally presenting the finished product to the two Conners and getting their reaction this is the exact system that I've used to scale my own AI business to over $100,000 per month in Revenue so if you're looking to start making money by selling AI Solutions and want to know exactly what you can sell to agencies or if you own an agency yourself and want to learn how AI can transform your business then this video is going to be extremely valuable for you at the end of the video after 7 Days of hard work building their AI systems I'm going to be asking Connor and Connor the most important question of all how much would you have paid for let's get started okay so today we're going to catch up with Connor and Connor my friends they're Alo based here out of Dubai and uh they have an email marketing agency running a very tight ship about 0% churn so my work is definitely cut out for me I'm excited to get in there introduce you to them they're really great guys um and then we're going to do a workshop some brainstorming on on notepads and things like that quite a formal situation and then I'm going to break things into a bit more informal with a group exercise activity which is going to be pretty cool and so I can really get a deeper understanding of their business and that's really what this whole day is about is learning about their business so that I can go back to the drawing board and uh and really map out my Solutions and show you that process so I'm going to cut to us talking to Connor and Conor in a second the juice got me tripping cut the walk roof Miss Missing ice lemonade my neck was Dripping ice lemonade my neck was Dripping hey boys huh yeah yeah yeah this way good man how you doing special guest EV all good yeah nice how we doing good good holy n that's part of the grip cut cut we we are we are walking [ __ ] Russ on this is the true this is the raw no no no don't look don't look okay so we're here with Conor and Connor um Conor G and Conor Conor s I'll let them introduce himself and sick but we're going to be doing a a workshop a brainstorming session just to really like map out the whole process of the business currently these guys are are crushing it in a number of ways I'll let them sort of talk about their business in a second but um got to math everything out here for me to analyze what potential Solutions we have have and then I'll be able to take that to the drawing board bit later today so if you guys want to give a little intro on your business and and the different roles that you guys play that would be good for sure yeah so we're the two co-founders of Kensington media house we are Ecommerce retention marketing ae3 primarily email marketing SMS marketing also do things like post purchase upsell ages direct response copywriting referral and loyalty schemes and other backend stuff and automations that we do for our clients I would follow more into the CMO I suppose my name is Conor suland I should have said that in the beginning and then also I'll let my co my co-founder introduce himself as well what's up so I'm Conor G I run more of the offside so kind of functioning as like Co type role so I essentially make sure that every everything keeps running for our clients in the back end I'm in charge of uh client success and you know kind of offside so I think there's a lot of opportunity here on the AI side of things so excited to get going there yeah so these guys won't probably won't say it but they're absolutely crushing it right now um I I'm not sure if they want me to share how many clients I've got but they are on a 0% turn I'm not sure if that's yearly or like overall like what's the it's been uh been a minute since we've had some churn I'd say that's probably you know since the start of the year that's s of away pretty much no churn and we're at 30 plus clients as far as you that's um I think I got my work cut out for me here um me trying to make anything better here it's going to be tough cuz they're obviously running a very tight ship but we're just going to get the entire operation down on paper and then I'll start to sort of Point things out and Conor's also got some ideas on things that he wants to talk to me about so we'll get to that now okay so that's been a good work sesh there we've got plenty of uh good source in here that I can't necessarily show you all of it but um tons of stuff for me to work on we're going to now jump into some uh extreme group exercise I want to get these guys out of the comfort zone a little bit and uh try to get a little bit more Source from them um so that I can give them the best possible solution so we can get stuck into that now in terms of the sort of longer term goals what do you really want out of the business suppose it's like be the best there is not ready at yoga would say so I was thinking about how you could potentially incorporate more AI features into all sorts of the onboarding process we got that what about hiring as well we Implement even 10% of what we talked about today G this even harder than building AI systems bro yeah Lord give me strength I was wondering what you guys thoughts were on uh transitioning out of just strictly em you got to be able to think of principles bro like you can't just be looking at tactical Stu for people you got to know how you're going able to raise their lifetime value overall say you provide more value to people over time yeah I think there's a lot of value these same agree agree man you know next time you want us to do this they're actually not available I'm actually sick that whatever it is I'll tip over oh let's go thank you thank you very much apprciate it it's easier it's just the heat the actual physicality of us not that not that bad you're wrong awful never worse yeah feeling loose feel like you want to tell me the business we don't have to mute off the camera really it's not that bad oh thank you won even if you're lying I appreciate it yeah which one which one of us is the best um maybe this the last one oh no different different poses each one is different you know gotta everyone's unique in their own way you know what I mean you're on what you're doing you know don't look at your friends what you're doing you know it's a metaphor for Life man just focus on yourself I didn't realize here to teach us some life lessons that's way there's an ulterior motive to the video that he's teaching us life lessons in a hardcore manner okay so we are back the next day now and I'm planning out my entire solution and how I'm actually going to approach all of the things that I've discussed with Conor and Connor um it's more of a technical evaluation of how I'm going to build the solutions taking all the notes connecting the different data sources how I'm actually going to deliver the solution what tools and platforms are going to use so you're going to get to see a timelaps of me doing my thing here and just planning everything out and getting ready to actually get into the building phase um and sort of sending a final brief of things on exactly how I'm going to build it and what it's going to feel like for the user so going to jump into that now okay so that's the customer success manager planned out we have uh obviously a lot to get through but the good thing is that a lot of the stuff I'm building here will help me carry over in terms of the code that I build will carry over nicely to the internal use chatbot to help the employees so ton of stuff there I got a couple questions I need to ask Connor and Connor but um good start on that okay so that's the internal chat bot it's got a couple things sop finder event logging generating Sops and some bookends and things like this it's going to be a second slack assistant likely so two separate ones the customer success manager and the internal use one so that's internal use chatbot and we got a couple challenges here that I need to address and these will be sort of my focus as I go on the next stage of this this one is a bit of a top secret one that you guys are actually not going to be able to see because the boys have asked me not to share it this is a major part of their business and I'm using AI to to enhance it so you guys aren't going to be able to see this just to keep their Edge in the market right so this is the onboarding automation that's going to take the questionnaire that they go through with the client on the first call collect 20 30 questions worth of information I'm going to Ping that from Firefly to chbt get that created into a notion doc that's going to notify them as soon as it's created and it's also going to convert that into a notion database and fill out all the fields of what they've answered just to build up a database of all the clients and all of the information Associated each so structured data and then there's going to be a document for sort of human readable usage as well so that's all of the planning done I'm probably going to put this on a bit of a figma board so that I can send it over to them hop on a call with Connor and Connor um run through things I got a couple questions as well once I've got all that information then I'm ready to actually start building and I'm actually super excited this has been a lot of fun this is like my favorite part of the process so I'm really excited to get started it's got to be fresh okay so on screen here you can see I have laid everything out that I'm going to do with the boys and a big figler board so I took those brainstorms and I converted them over into a very very indepth layout of the data structures of all of the functions that it's going to do I mean like this goes very in depth if you can see some of that so I've sent this over to them they're all good to hop on a call just run over things did you get some confirmation about how we want to store the data cuz I've already got a lot of things set up on no so I want to BU an air table cuz it's more flexible and has a lot more functionality so found some options for data syncing between notion and uh air table that I want to run through with them so going to jump on the call get some feedback and sort of lock in the final plan and design to move forward with so I'm very excited to get sh into the [Music] bo Conor all I can share the screen so there's a couple sort of tactical decisions you need to make now uh before moving forward on the data side of things but I have been doing some research and I think we could have some good Solutions [Music] here so that was a good call with the lads uh they pretty happy with things I need a couple little edits here and there just to make sure it's all working with their systems I got some much needed data on how they're actually handling their tasks and and campaigns and structures and like this so we're all good to use air table and notion I've got a way we can sync the data between the two because the boys are using notion very very heavily throughout the business so I'm going to sync up both databases and I'm all ready to go I'm going to get into the building phase now which could last a couple days could last a week who who knows how long but I'm ready to get started now and then I got into the building phase of this project which was very fun but also very challenging at times I'm connecting voice flow make an air table all together okay so we're on route to Conor and Corners right now I'm actually pretty nervous because I've had a bunch of issues with the build over the past day um and I'm really hoping that it doesn't blow up my face on game day so all of the work I put in hoping that everything goes well um and really get the value that I I think that I built here and get a a gauge on whether they think it's valuable as well so I'm going to be asking them how much they would have paid for it and hopefully it's something in the sort of $3 to $5,000 range after the amount of work I put into this all right so we're here with the boys and we're going to run over what I built for them I'm going to get their thoughts on it make sure they're fully clear on exactly what different components of the build are um sort of a little bit of an onboarding for Connor in case he wants to hop in and make edits to it and then at the end of it I'm going to be able to show it in action on slack um and then also get their thoughts on it and sort of what they would have valued this at and really what they would have paid for it if I was to have done this as a sort of paid contractor for it so we have part Numero Uno which is the voice flow chat box so we got the in internal uh and external ones and over here you can see on slack you have this kmh assistant and I put a little bit of a branding thing on it so it looks quite clean so we have the brand database which is sinking nicely with uh the notion database so any updates on Notions are immediately passed over to here so whenever a new revision sort of gives it a bit more context when a new revision is created it's going to send an actionable slack message so then new revision created by for in this case I haven't created the brand for that particular row um but description of it assigned to and the people assigned to that brand they can Market is completed or is you found this is the Urgent Message feature uh which I know you wanted to have so that when they go through the uh they find out that they're in Focus time so I can show you I did set up this thing so where if I tag someone if I go at Le mle it's going to check my calendar see if I'm in Focus time and if they are it's going to give them a duration until I'm outside of focus time then if the request is urgent please use my urgent message feature so you can hit to apps on the left hand panel messages and then there's a button here that says stand Ur message if I run this this is the back end that's managing it only way I can describe it is tacky technology is half now yeah that's true okay start and it should go say something here to receiv it okay so uh this is just a bit of debugging saying okay we've logged in so this is the user accounts management so this is who's logged in and this is the brand the user ID so this stuff won't be in the final version but so if I go send Urgent Message and I can just go Sean I should be able to pick it up from just Sean would you like me to notify sh about I can say you published the wrong flow you like that you're keeping it realistic as well and then should pop up here give it a second there we go Sean's Ur notifications from from publish the wrong FL so straight on there and we can just add him into that so he's going to get notifi you'll have this direct Channel and this is set up for all the other guys as well and it's just from who for which brand and then it's the message that they sent now I won't bore you with making you watch this entire thing this is just me going back and forth with the guys showing them all of the other features including the different tables and air table the functionality and voice flow in the back end and then also showing it working live within slack as well once I was done it was time to ask him the most important question of all sry Bo if I were to come to you and say I would set all this up how much would I be able to charge you um just like when you actually think like the human carpal element of like how much time will be saved if it allows your team to go offline for even 4 hours a day I say that you got 10 team members that's 40 hours a day really across your entire team do you know what I mean that's over 2,000 hours of focus work a month all the bot does is it facilitates your ability to do that you now have like one of the highest performing agencies on earth like easily down yeah it's easy five figers well do you have it LS and less that's been uh that's been episode one of how to automate in this case it's been Nemo marketing agency adding your features onto this is a as a walk in the park so you can just add a new button into that main menu and then build more functionality onto it in terms of other agencies wanting toly the same thing sick I love it man we got it bro appreciate it go um and we'll catch you back in stew uh to finish this thing off the St back in the St so there we have it in just 7 days I was able to identify and build four powerful solutions for Kensington media house Valu at over $10,000 by the boys themselves which they calculated off the amount of increased output and sort of time and work that their team members would do over the coming months now I think they're being a bit generous there but maybe you could call it $5,000 in value added which is a pretty good result considering I only spent 7even days on this so the final solutions that I ended up providing to the boys was firstly an AI enhanced client success manager chatbot an AI enhanced internal assistant chatbot an air table database partially synced with the company's notion and another AI solution that directly relates to a major aspect of their service delivery which I'm actually not allowed to mention as I talked about before now all of these Solutions were built using no code or low code platforms such as voice flow slack repl air table make and stack AI all of which are going to be linked down below if you want to check them out now to walk you through this entire build and all of the different parts of it would take hours probably which I obviously can't fit into this video however if you want to steal the 40 plus hours of work that I've put into this project and literally start selling these exact same solutions to other agencies or other businesses all of the templates for everything covered in the this build is being given away to my AAA accelerator members as part of their subscription I'll also be doing a complete behind the scenes breakdown of this entire build within a workshop within my accelerator Community it'll also be recorded for any latecomers who join um after I've done it so if you want to get instant access to all of these templates and the workshops Etc you can join the community in the link in the description below but all in all I'm so glad I took on this challenge despite having really no idea how I could help these guys initially this was the first project that really forced me to go deep on the ADV features of air table and its automation capabilities plus how you can connect voice flow to slap via repet I've learned so much in the past 7 days which is really just made me better at identifying and creating AI Solutions in the future and therefore like essentially making me a more valuable AI entrepreneur because in in many ways our key skill as AI automation agency owners is being able to see opportunities for AI to improve businesses and then building the necessary systems to do that honestly this this video is only just scratching the surface of what is possible with AI for businesses so if you want to learn more then you can check out my full guide to starting an AI automation agency which will be available up here and finally a massive thank you to Conor and Conor for making this entire project possible so if any of you are interested in working with one of the best email and retention marketing Specialists for your business or for anyone that you know the Kensington media House website will be linked below I can vouch for these guys 100% not only on the business side but also as as people themselves I really love spending time with them and I can guarantee that you will like working with them long term as well so leave me a comment below letting me know what kind

              "text": "okay this is my 43 side hustle idea let's give it a go what's going on every wild and what you're about to watch is an interview between myself and Mark a member from a AAA accelerated Community who has made over $50,000 in the past few months and he happened to be in Dubai at the same time as me so I thought what better way to continue to put out wins and share wins for my both paid and my free community think to get him here on the channel for a full length interviews in this video Mark is sharing his interesting five acquisition method that is allowing him to generate thousands of leads per week and now at the point today where every single day almost guaranteed to get two to four leads two of them are willing to spend well above $5 to $110,000 and how you can apply the exact same things to your AI automation agency to start making money so the secret sauce is you start with four to five things that you know you can deliver ideally in one day my most famous offer for me that converted was and he also shares some of the things that he wishes he knew before he go started that is a really good again gateway to get that call and maybe the end of this lead magnet you have hey you want to talk about UI solution strategy cly link like just it's that easy to get a book and that's really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we cover in this video there's so much gold scattered throughout for anyone looking to start an AI business so if you're interested and want to get into AI business I really recommend you into the entire thing and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback in the comments welcome everyone to a bit of a new format on the channel um I'm fortunate enough to be joined here by Mark a member of the uh AA accelerator Community he happened to be in Dubai uh just as I arrived really so today we're going to be a little bit of interview on him his success um really getting him to to tell the story and share what worked for him um what didn't um and then we can get into a little bit more about um his business and how he's scaling that up at the moment so um it's great to have you Mark and I'm really excited to have chat to you pleasure I'm so happy to be your first yeah it's the first one it is a new format for the channel um and I think whenever there's someone in Dubai or I'm in the same place we will try to find a place like this to to have a chat so if you want to jump in and tell us a little bit about yourself um your journey and sort of how you got to this point and then we can can get into sort of the nitty-gritty and your results and things like that yeah for sure so yeah Mark um from Canada here for the next 6 hours until I catch my flight but uh yeah I I have a background in AI for the past five to seven years um I've been in the space I worked first in like HR analytics for like five years um I taught myself to code from scratch I used to be a finance guy couldn't take it um self-taught did analytics for five years wanted to jump into this thing called AI in 2015 2016 before the hype before the hype well every like six years there's a new hype this is like the final hype where everyone can enter kind of thing back then I'm like how do I make it so I went to Australia networked with some people went to the UK networked with some people probably bought over a hundred books and then eventually I did a Ms in AI in Canada and then in there really taught myself how to really code um ma sheine learning all the buzzwords I learned what they actually mean and like unfortunately the math behind them so after that I was just obsessed with becoming a dat data scientist so I became a data scientist after like 80 interviews of rejections I kept losing to physicists over and over because I was that guy that was the finance guy the business guy they didn't have what it takes basically um eventually got in moved up uh eventually worked at Amazon for a bit as an AI and bi engineer and then yeah I've been work I I've been uh working at startups ever since and I've been side hustling ever since so I don't know if you want to go there yeah how old are you first that it help so they get a bit of context in terms of how long you been been in this game and sort of the things the time span over which you've been able to try these yeah compared to you dinosaur 29 years old right now but peeking on 30 and have a lot of goals before 30 I'm trying to squeeze in a short amount of time especially with this uh AAA stuff yeah we seem to be on the right track so um if you want to give us a bit of a breakdown on how you sort of transition from your roles in Amazon and the startups over to sort of what you're doing now and and my content and all that sort of things and how you got into this this space for sure so I started around last year in December literally a few days after chat chbt came out I'm like okay this is my 43d side hustle idea let's give it a go um up until then 40 of my 42 were dramatic failures because it was things that I wanted to make money online but one had no inherent skill set two didn't actually care about it and three didn't appreciate what it took to actually make real money so all the Drop Shipping all the Shopify stuff I used to make dashboards as a service I tried pretty much everything I could I came to the conclusion I am not an entrepreneur I am an entrepreneur which is why I took refuge in startups for most of my career um and then around January February came across your stuff near the end of February and it was at the perfect time I started off my consultancy called prompt advisors as prompt engineering is a service I called it pass try to act cool um pass made me a solid like couple hundred bucks for the first like month or so um and up until I reached your content maybe made five grand in total but that's five full hours day and night writing prompts for people and when I saw your stuff I'm like man I am not thinking about this industry the right way there are way more scalable ways way more interesting ways to apply AI than what I'm doing like I was looking way too small so you kind of like opened the horizons there and as soon as you started do like the code alongs you started getting into things that other people weren't talking about so the biggest video that I watched fling me up yeah no I'm me I started there at the same point as you I think it's just like like we've talked about before it's I don't think it's it's anyone's like fault that you like only saw the the prompting opportunity I think we were all stuck in that limited sort of ceiling of of what we could do and how it was always make money with chat GPT right these kind of things and and prompting as a service and and sort of the prompt marketplaces that popped up were definitely the first way that people go hey if I do a certain thing I can make a bunch of money off this but you're able to to transition that and I think I was just fortunate enough to to have been running my own business and on a significant enough scale to have seen okay well there's actually a whole other thing to do here and I was just i' say I was in the right place at the right time and doing the right things to be able to see a little opportunity and then really put it out into the world and people like you to be able to run with it in different ways that I never could so if you want to go on to how you transition from the prompting over to what you're doing now and the kind of success and results you've had so far sure absolutely so in December January until February I was on Fiverr literally just offering prompt as a service after content I started experimenting with different offers building you web applications building you chat Bots building you um doing AI Consulting in general just helping companies look at what they have doing what is now called an AI audit I used just call it Consulting before um and I started going into every vertical that I could because I have the background so when I get on a call I don't have to fake it I know the stuff it's just this is the first time I'm actually able to package it in a way that makes sense and I can actually make money off it so I started offering like six core services and and I did not Niche down I refused because I had the background so anything that came my way I took it so I started off with real estate and then marketing and then SEO agencies would reach out anyone that knocked on my door opened just to see what what they're looking for because if you go through all like my AI fireflies recordings I have almost a 100 business ideas from Pain points that actual people in Industries have so I started hiring a team a month and a half ago I've been solo preneur for a while and then at some point all night and I still have my day job because I'm not ready to go full bananas yet um started hiring a team have a team of five people now looking expand it more if you're a developer please message me ASAP and you're good yeah no no message me first and then I'll pass on to onto Mar after yeah and then um with Fiverr things started blowing up um I was asked to recently be a keynote on this webinar that was streamed on YouTube LinkedIn live yeah through F so underrated man even I I haven't really explored enough and I think your story is really open my mind so what's possible for Fiverr I was making like couple hundreds of dollars and I was excited about that and now I'm at the point today where every single day almost guaranteed to get two to four leads two of them are willing to spend well above $5 to $10,000 if I'm able to deliver and more so deliver the dream like actually speak to the vision of how how it's going to go from A to Z literally today I got a messag first thing in the morning I want to build an AI agent that can take 15,000 personas and be able to represent my clients at Nike and Salesforce to do XYZ something I'd never created a business plan around but now that Fiverr is an international platform I got hit up from Switzerland to South Africa for like African wild reserves trying to automate portions of their business wild reserves yeah I'm not joking and then yesterday when I was in Dubai I was like uh meeting a client who specialized in selling truffles luxury truffles to six five six seven star hotels in Dubai and after yes yesterday there's a difference between meeting in person shaking hands looking eye to eye and as of this morning I'm in the Truffle business now we're in the Truffle business yeah yeah so it's it's been awesome it's not stopping as long as I can scale my team with it it'll be hopefully a winner because like I feel like we're really head of the game and obviously thanks to you for being able to break that so so are you man um if you want to give us quickly the the numbers the role numbers so we can get that out there open the hype around around the mock story and then I got a couple other questions to go back home sure um first like three months five grand like I said and then three months later at Top Line total was like 30 and then the last three months been awesome so added another 27,000 being super specific cuz I look at them every day had a couple refunds in between but like we we're netting right now like 57,000 with in the pipe another 10 hopefully fingers crossed okay and that's that's all coming from FIV basically 95% yeah never sent one inbound reach out yet sorry outbound reach out yet so a couple things to unpack there is FIV as a as a high ticket lead source and I think this is something I've I've encountered other people here in Dubai that I've had chats to sort of the guys who um put me on to a lot of the AI development firm stuff that I was doing way back at the start of the year way back um but Fiverr actually being a a place where not only little jobs get done and I think a lot of us as entrepreneurs are familiar with fivr and this the small little itty bitty kind of uh tools and and little hacks that you're going to do it's like make a logo I could go in FIV but we're using it in that way to do these little tasks but people in this especially in the space where this AI development thing has not necessarily had the chance to really manifest itself all over the internet in terms of like really reliable Google search or or rankings and stuff like this with the AI development companies the best ones are not being presented first people are trying to find a way to get access to these services and if you take the whole portion of the world in the search volume and people who want the stuff a significant amount of that is at least going to run past fire and say hey there any any guys on that so can you go through a bit of your five strategy I know you've been like shotgun mode on that um how you have positioned yourself on Fiverr and and any sort of tips and tricks you want to pass on to people who are looking to use Fiverr as as an acquisition Source sure I like to position a lot of my offerings on Fiverr as gateway drugs so my first order will always be like a couple hundred bucks and that doesn't excite many people horse exactly my Trojan Horse but I kill it so well on that couple1 order that leads to the next call that leads to the next call that leads to the thing that they actually wanted to hire a development firm offshore to do which is like some web app they do some integration to their database using GPT whatever it is so I started off literally again making tens of dollars so if you start today I guarantee you will not make $10,000 a month this anti-hype you will if you're consistent you're good and you're actually like you have the background to deliver you will make good money six to eight months from the time you start and you're killing it meaning like you're always delivering on time you always respond as quickly as you can you there's hacks that I have where where I try to always be online by putting my laptop online making it not go to sleep mode so I can always get DMS so that's one major thing two a lot of people are reluctant to actually send a DM on Fiverr inquire one because they're lazy and two they're skeptical they see when I started there was like one page and 18 gigs for AI right now if you go and put just GPT you're going to find 30 to 50 pages just on GPT there's so many to sift through and many people are top rated or Fiverr Pro there's all these little tags you get for killing it on the platform I just started putting my cly Link at the bottom of my description for a free consult and then within two weeks of doing that I think in April every week start off with three calls going from zero and then every day I started getting one call and then now like I said I'm at the point where it's like two to four per day and it's awesome because the more I speak to people even if they don't fully convert I just know where there's a need somewhere for a service for AAA that I might have not figured out yet yet but yeah that's kind of been my strategy so far and I can give you some more but I'll hold it there for now in terms of like the packaging cuz I know five you can list yourself with multiple job PST right so are you doing Niche specific and saying I can do this for this or what are what are a couple examples of you I don't want to give away a secret Source but if you're a Cas sharing some of the some of the like the job post titles that you're putting up because I know you're not necessarily saying you can or maybe you are but a specific solution you're positioning yourself out that's that's really the key thing here yeah I'm okay to share the secrets because there's a gate that most people will have to hop on manually so on Fiverr you can only post five gigs at the beginning until you're what's called level one meaning you've made x amount of money that's been through the platform obviously there can be money that go outside the platform depending on how things go they don't like that once you're level one you get some street cred whatsoever because when people are filtering they don't want a new seller or like a newbie right they want to spend money get the thing at the time you told it once you break level two that's you made like a I think a couple thousand dollars and then uh what's it called pro rated is like $10,000 us so a lot of people that like have the money want to do the thing will click on Pro and then top rated and they go for that and does that does that Compound on the gig so like you're pro rated for the gig or you're pro rated your whole account because I know there's those pro rated ones that are like 10 times more expensive than the than the regular ones or or is that the the FIV recommended ones five recommended okay so on this one just keep unlocking the gates and for the whole account yeah for the whole account so like right now on the platform I can post 20 gigs right so now I can cast a wider net so the secret sauce is you start with four to five things that you know you can deliver ideally in one day my most famous offer for me that converted was I'll build you X in one day people love that especially when it's AI like they can do something for 100 to 500 bucks see if it works see if their idea has legs and then go from there they love that so Speed and Agility is the number one way to kill it on Fiverr and obviously quality and in terms of going back to sort of the niche versus General debate I know I I push a lot to to Niche down and I think this is a great example of of when not Niche down um and uh in terms of going General in the same way that my my morning side AI is is a general AI development company um when how has your skills as a and background really lended itself to taking that General Route and what would you say for for people looking to start their own automation agency how to weigh up that decision between niched versus uh going General and really trying to get a a wide net spread initially got it so my background helps me because when I get on a call I actually know what I'm saying so if someone like objection handles me oh but have you tried this but what about chain prompting but what about if we prompted this way I can actually explain why in under two minutes so I can establish Authority very quickly because I didn't memorize it I didn't just watch Liam's video and memorize it and just kind of like threw it on the call I actually took the time to digest it synthesize it so that comes off really well for someone starting off new spend the time don't do cold Outreach until you actually understand something but understand it deeply especially I do recommend niching down if you don't have the background in machine learning data science analytics because you won't have a transferable skill set you'll just be saying please buy my bot it's so good it's so much better than the free ones you can get like off off the market right d AI whatever whatever the market is if you don't have that Niche just focus on let's say chat Bots could be your gateway drug for yourself to learn about this technology and ideally get a couple hundred bucks in the process as well if you can do a couple couple of their services on FIV right absolutely absolutely and then after that start to actually understand what's happening behind the scenes because the magic here is why does GPT 3.5 answer the way it does forget just like the knowledge base and how that works how does it actually go through that knowledge base and then come up with a response why is it helpful one you can already objection handle why something might not work which they give you confidence that hey this guy knows what he's talking about he knows what might go wrong and he knows why it might go wrong so like they people want someone to lead them through the dark AI is Darkness for many companies and you'd be surprised how many very rich companies are very poor in Ai and this whole knowledge space so if you can be that person that leads the blind you're already making yourself very valuable so you have to know enough to be able to lead the blind that's kind of like my main tip that would give someone yeah okay yeah that's that's sort of similar to what I said and and why I recommend to go Niche for people is because if you are just starting out and you're you're M to AI maybe even haven't run a business before you don't have a development background I I say it's easier to be an expert at one thing and say hey maybe I don't know all of this stuff but I know about this Niche and I know this solution within it and I I recommend that is a good starting point for people but ideally if you if you do have more of a broader skill set and you can start to it's hard to become an expert in everything right so if you wanted to come and might take you 3 six months to get a a depth of knowledge enough to be able to address multiple different Market market and for me that was through my my consultations that I did earlier in early in the year and it was just reps and Reps and Reps and Reps and Reps of getting on these calls and sort of communicating what I know and passing it on and like you said using the smaller clients and and really using that as your means to learn and Implement as well so if any of you wanted to to come up to speed on what he was talking about there a lot of the like deeper understanding of of how especially chat Bots work I'm going to plug my video because you probably haven't bothered watching it CU you already know all that stuff um but I I have my 3-hour monster monster chatbot video so that'll probably be up here somewhere if you want to watch that but I go through I think it's like an hour and a half of theory first on in terms of how specifically customiz chatbots and current sort of modern chatbots is what I call it are working so if you want to come up to speed in the most efficient way possible I'd say watch that video get the notebook out and it's a good resource and I'm going to shamelessly plugged that there but and so you've obviously had quite a lot of clients already what are the uh sort of commonalities that you're seeing what are the the key use cases that you're seeing and the things you've already delivered on and uh what are your learnings from that CU there's definitely a lot that I've learned trying to different things and being like okay that's a no-o area don't go there again yeah so for the most part um again a multi-industry commonalities I see between all clients that all of them don't know how to ram a bunch of information from their company from their business effectively to be able to do x x could be could be a web application could be a chatbot they don't know that part so if you can walk them through and you understand that part fully super helpful they all don't know how that works and when you say the word chunking they start thinking about like I don't know chunky like a chocolate bar something like that so you got to walk them through it and avoid actually using the buzzwords so I always like the most successful thing I've had is I make my own analogy as to like what a vector database is in plain English and I try my best to never say the word Vector database knowledge base nothing I say imagine you have a database you know what a database is there's rows and columns now imagine there's like a special type of database that takes words and it converts them to numbers we want to look up those numbers and every time you write something in a chat B comes a number so like it's as if you're kind of like bringing it down to grade five but in a very not um arrogant way but kind of like again leading you to water way so that's been super helpful in terms of key use cases over the past couple weeks specifically it's been AI agents like I think a lot of people are looking at that as the next step um previously probably April March was chatbot frenzy oh my God there's this thing called a chat Bo can learn your thing you can automate all your customer support that was like March April May to June is when like hey like what if we had an internal web application kind of tailored to our business with our branding where we can upload documents securely and talk to it and get citations Etc um and I found in July and August start some of the companies started reaching out that were Enterprise specific which is super hard if you're starting and I would highly highly recommend you don't start at Enterprise I've said that too it's just not like it's not in the realm of possibility for even even like we are at morning side just starting to like get into those and it is such a big job and if you are looking to get money quickly Enterprises move slow so you're going to be sitting there for I mean the deal might not go through for 3 to six months after that so yeah beware absolutely um but like Pro tip if you want to if you're ready for Enterprise you want to start looking at which services offer large language models like GPT in a way that's really easy and scalable to use and secure so little tip is there's an open AI in the normal world for like you use AP but then there's open AI in Azure where it's like secure encrypted so if you are ready to jump there highly recommend you like take a look at that from your experiences with these different clients have you start I mean I think one of the good things about being General is that you get a lot of exposure so if you're early on and you have the skills or you want to take the general out rather than niching down because it's it's kind of Alex Alex Mozzy when I was on the interview with him he was saying really when it's General versus niched are you really picking where the hard is and as a as a niche seller you you're choosing to do the hard things earlier on which is Mark market research identifying a need creating a solution and then being able to scale that and you get the easier benefits and it sort of gets easier after that because you're continuing to to sell that the operational efficiency the messaging and things like that so in the longer run it's it's easier to scale a niched offer but at the start for a a general it's going to be easier to get clients but then harder to service them on on the back end so I think one of the routes from General to something more scalable and something similar that I talked to Hans another interview that I did on the channel recently he is looking to take his solution and really starting to productize so that he can scale it CU he needs that as a one person business he really needs that that simplification of the of the product to be able to scale it um as a general agency are there any things you're starting to see that is exciting for you and potentially hey like I could maybe productize that and make it part of a niche specific solution that I can sell and then on Fiverr or you could start even doing outbound and you can start running ads and things like that to say okay this thing I know works and like you said you've learned so much are you looking at some things and be like maybe that's that could be a bit of move long term and I might try transitioning into that yeah yeah I won't reveal too much behind the curtain because you don't have to say specifically yeah investing heavily in a specific concept but the concept of security not in in how you serve the responses or where you store the data that you let's say use a chat bot but security and large language models in general um it's a topic that people are not really talking about right now everyone's got a chatbot and everyone's got a web app but once the trolls really come out and once the Bad actors really come out who want to break them there's way to to break them so I think there's a huge untapped industry into how do you make your chat bot or chat interface unbreakable or unhackable so that's where I see a multi multibillion opportunity that we're barely talking about and even the antivirus companies are not talking about yes uh that that kind of leads into the the sort of broader scope of the the AAA model and I've talked about it a lot on Twitter as well but this as a as a stepping stone to to get the ball rolling and get momentum to springboard into these bigger opportunities so I see agency models not the not the highest leverage things they as you were delivering Services yourself basically as a freelancer for a while now you have a team which we can go into in a bit how do you see the the AI automation agency model fitting into your overall strategy as a as a springboard to build that Capital build that expertise like you've just been exposed to and how does that fit into your your Widder strategy say in in three to five years from now where do you want to be well the first part is going to say I'm going to reference your material so you said something a long time ago which is this model is really unique because right now you dealing with GPT 3.5 GPT 4 one year from now it'll be gb25 your upsell opportunities are almost infinite because you can always go back to a client that was happy with your work a year ago and knock on the door and say hey um you remember gbt 4 there's this new thing called gbt 6 it's kind of like this card you are telling you to upgrade your your wheels Apple exactly yeah or get a new iPhone 15 which is exact same as 14 this should actually be a big upgrade right it's even B so exactly so that to me is super appealing so the next part is I want the Consulting portion of my business to remain because it always keeps me Nimble meaning if I over invest into one tool every single day right now if you go on there's an AI for that.com you will see 8,000 tools and I looked at that same web page in March and it was 500 okay so where's that going to be in one year from now where people really start hearing about it it's going to be like 20,000 so where I see the opportunities I'm going to keep Consulting because I always want to keep a pulse as to where the pain great listening Point like you get so much data from those Consulting calls exactly and then I want to invest in my hero product that I'm using all these Consulting calls to fuel because now my new gateway drug will be from first gig to first major project to hey have you thought about security and then that's a natural next upsell so the Consulting part I see is a very long-scale business cuz even if something comes out that automates 20% of jobs I will inform the people that care the most about that new technology how they can do that you're always ahead of the game you're always on that wave that's coming which is awesome because you're never looking up and seeing this huge tsunami on you you're the one actually going behind it in terms of your positioning as a as your personal brand I know from this you're probably going to get a good boost on there and hopefully for your business as well but how are you positioning your business in terms of a a landing page or a website or The Branding perspective and how are you positioning yourself personal personal branding wise as a as an AI consultant and someone who's uh like your LinkedIn Etc so take us through those two different branding points sure yeah I'd say branding has been my my Achilles heel because I've invested zero amount of time in it and I think now that I'm building a team I'm starting to free myself up from doing every single call on my own I'm going to start really investing in actually building that LinkedIn I started a newsletter an AI newsletter a month ago I was going at it every day I'm like you know what 90 days or whatever heroi says 100 days and it broke like 30 days in because I'm like money to keep the business going or newsletter um so I'm going to really invest in that I actually want to make my own YouTube but not in terms of cods or how to build a thing I want to actually talk about big picture where do I see things going the next 3 five I mean you've got the background of anything it's always why should I listen to you thing just like I've been I've been doing this for a long time and now I'm I'm running this business that's you in this so listen to me yeah yeah but like you got that personality I still got to develop that camera personality you guys can go back and see my first my first video i' I think I've I've archived my first one because it was that bad I was sitting there I like the most monotone delivery ever I was stacking my camera on a bunch of books just just absolutely terrible so it is something that you can build up and even I'm quite a a low emotion and sort of expressionless person so I really have to put I think I'm putting it on a lot but it comes out being as L like just just possible so that's great you're a lot more animated than I am so I'm sure you you'll pick it up very easily I hope so but yeah beyond that I'm going uh pretty bananas on the lead magnet so right now with the help of AI I have this cool little lead magnet stream where I'm building books on different portions so Ai and marketing Ai and HR and I have let's say there's a tool called anthropic it's really good for long context windows I feed it some stuff from the internet I'm like hey use this inspiration REM me whole book on this then I'll take it I'll actually write my own ideas and then I'll throw it to a Ghost Rider on Fiverr so you see that little feedback loop and then it create the lead magnet so right now I got like 10 lined up going to start shipping those going to try to give like the whole thing away for free as a lead magnet it's kind of like a Facebook ad um so a lot of things down the pipe and when the newsletter starts really pumping out um I'm going to use that as a my authority Bas as to why should you listen to me or why should you work with me that's kind of where I'm thinking and so you think of bundling all of those those lead backs together like hey claim this package for like your whole business all different areas or you going to be shooting them off sort of more targeted office in terms of saying hey if you're if you're HR manager is AI for HR in your business so recently I got to network with a couple people for example killing their newsletter business and I noticed that the way you target someone who cares about newsletters is vastly different from someone that's willing to read something so the average person is watching your videos cuz even though you could give them a book saying here's how to make $100,000 they will not read it so they need Liam to explain it to them in under like 20 minutes or less I'm not very good at that I I'm trying to cut it down a lot but I I always try to I do need to condense my content a little bit more yeah exactly but like there's some people that will actually read the things I want a medium for every person that might want to care about this and from what I can see the total addressable Market is everyone so why not structure certain lead magnets very thoughtfully in a medium that makes most sense for that end user M that's kind of my strategy yeah it's interesting because for my for my Z to 10K chall I've created a I decided to switch my Outreach up I could probably switch it up again now that I'm ready to sort of scale up and get my first paying clients but I created a an a lead magnet that's an ebook and it's five DIY AI hacks or cheat codes for your online fitness coaching business and I should have probably tested the the title first but a great way for for many of you if you're looking to do some kind of Outreach and you're thinking of creating some kind of lead maget like that even if you're just shooting it out via email is to you can go on you can go on instantly you can set up you can get your lead list and you can start split testing with five different first emails five different Le like lead magnet titles so instead of just doing five DIY AI cheat codes for your online fitness coaching business I could have done five different titles and then seen the response rate and all of those on them saying hey yeah I'm interested and then based it off that so right I could have tested the concept before but I have a bit of sort of perception when it comes to picking these titles I'd say I was able to pick one that that did get a good response rate so the thing is that I've found is that there's a good response rate and they're saying yeah I'm interested cuz I think I positioned it well but the content of it could be a lot more simple so I'm not sure what your uh experience is I guess have you started seeing them out yet no all line them up but basically however that's going to feed into your newsletter yeah ah got you so now it's going to be a lead magnet within a lead magnet lead magnet setion I like a call mag um but pretty much it's very visual heavy and you know those textbooks from elementary school like a science textbook where it has like a did you know section it's literally like like the yellow kind of like sidebars and stuff basically I'm trying to make it as consumable as possible maybe to the extent of the hormos you know $100 million leads there's like pictures made for caveman brain like mine but yeah it's it's good me too yeah I think that was the issue with my lead magnet like I've I've sent out probably like 20 or 30 of them now and I think I've had like two calls booked in because it's very information rich but it's not laid out in the most appealing way um and in terms of them Implement it's basically five things that they can set up on their own and I have like a notion document and a loom video for each of them so if they're really interested they would go and watch these videos but it still seems too complex so I should probably have a click here to download the template and install like this um rather than saying here this is how you set it up so I think if you guys are creating some sort of lead magnet and providing value that way make sure make sure like Mark said that you're making it as visually appealing and accessible as possible yeah I would say like I think corosi also said this recently which is like you want a lead magnet so good that people would actually pay for it yeah so if you position something offer in itself right it's an offer in itself so if that is your lead magnet there a really good again gateway to get that call and maybe at the end of this lead magnet you have hey do you want to talk about youri solution strategy cly link like just it's that easy to get a booking yeah I i' seated that thing all the way through it's like at the end of every video say like so maybe I was selling a little bit too much but I got a couple iterations to doing that for sure I want to talk about your team and how you've I mean hiring if you anyone's running an automation agency you know that hiring or even just AI development company you know that hiring AI divs or even just hiring devel in general is uh is no easy business so can you talk us through sort of what your team's at right now the sort of key pressures that lead you to getting your team and because you were building them yourself originally um and and how you're managing the team as well I'll start off with like the biggest challenge which is like on a developer side my turnover has been crazy really yeah just because it's that really hard to find a developer that has the price point per hour that makes sense when you give that offer to the client that you're making at least 20 % minimum profit two that they actually care to stick with you and they're not actually with like four or five other agencies they're committed three that they kind of resemble your work ethic so sometimes yesterday I didn't sleep I slept one hour because I was taking a couple client calls cuz I'm in Dubai time and there's people on the Pacific coast who's still like awful awful it's awful it's really hard to find people that are willing to grind like that with you and a lot of times with the de Dev work you start off with a certain scope and right before delivery four or five things happen and some people just bolt halfway throughing and I'm stuck right um so after that point I found a couple key devs that have been pretty pretty loyal and pretty good you find them through you through your program yeah no through Thea the community yeah Discord um it was awesome especially the premium portion job boards much better quality that I'm helping you out I'm pluging for you oh yeah I don't know if I've me you he has a as a member of the accelerator and this is where I've been sort of he's actually a success story if you haven't already been in um and he's got his his place Plus all over there so um it's great to get an accelerated member to sort of share the on what we've got yeah um and recently I hired someone to finally take my place on some of these calls as an authority figure um so she's actually in AI space herself she used to work at IBM did a lot of Consulting for them so I'm starting to again remove myself as much as I can so I can actually think big I still have never done cold Outreach and this is what I've done so far so imagine if I actually tried and imagine if I doubled my team and imagine I did actual lead magnets like all the reasons that I would pay consultant how do I scale my business I know I just have to free my time to be able to do it yes it's funny we have the same thought with like morning side we've never run any like we don't run an offer we're not like getting in front of people and saying hey we we have this development company so this it's like really comforting for us knowing that there's this whole other world of potential for the business that we can unlock at any point and I think we're going to start sort of pushing it now as we have some pretty cool case studies this year uh but knowing that you have you're able to find success off of Fiverr and you know like when the time comes you want to set things up and and like okay I'm going to get agency in here to help me run some Google search ads and I'm going to start running some code outbound and things like this um you're like wow that could really once you have the the systems and teams in place all right that's the kick it and what's cool is my original lead Source Fiverr will now become my social proof because like hey like we're we're big on Fiverr go check our reviews cuz like I'll be open about that so where you start especially if it's a Marketplace application it can actually be your lead Source five six seven months down the line that helps you legitimize why should I work with you yeah I'm I'm a top seller for ai ai Solutions on a FIV yeah exactly and when it comes to to managing your uh managing your team what are you currently doing there if you go to m Slack are you using like a Monday to manage the projects I'm honestly not that sophisticated yet it's WhatsApp groups Discord calls alignment calls but right now even within my five person team we're not all aligned at the same time I worry about with the new consultant on how do you manage the leads how do you talk to the leads what's the flow and with the developers like the four that I got you specialize in chat Bots you two are going to help me with this Azure stuff cuz it's heavy lift and you help me with these crazy random AI agent things I'm getting that's kind of the distribution I still again have yet to get to the point where we're having Sprints fell boards so it's a lot of work it's chaos it's chaos for a long time yes it's absolute chaos so was a bit of feedback to myself uh for you in your position being in the in the accelerated community so I'm going to just talk about that to get a little bit transparency as to what it's helpful for me to know what resources you found useful was it for someone in your position maybe just a community and be a to get network with other people some of the workshops that helpful what are you getting the most value out of and what's helped you the most in terms of your success from the from the accelerated community that you're in okay first I'll give a solid disclaimer that will help people if you're just paying to be somewhere it won't make you money so if you are paying for the AAA and you do nothing but you just you're there in the chat nothing will happen so the most important things for me was number one the workshops we l just walked here listen to one of the workshops on a crazy new tool I'm not going to ruin it for anybody please W please watch that Workshop if you're in the triaa two when I was working on the job boards putting up those posts I got all my leads from there so I did like 40 interviews to get to like two guys that were really good so I wouldn't have been able to do that elsewhere where am I going to go indeed LinkedIn I'm not even I wasn't even legitimate enough to go on LinkedIn let alone pay someone a salary um so it really lowered the barrier to entry there in terms of the quality of the chat again it's like how you make it so if you go in you're saying Hey how do I build a chatbot probably not ideal but if you go in saying hey this is what I tried this is how it failed or succeeded what could I do better someone's going to swoop in who has way more experience than you and actually give you some solid help so if you help yourself I try but there are way better members in the group but if if you try and you fail productively it's such a solid group It's actually an accountability group if you use it to your advantage if you put the effort to earn that so the the workshop's helpful for you and the I mean for you hiring as as a hiring resource and I think it's it's good to be when we we're even hiring out of the I think we're on our third or fourth hire out of the community and I've always said that I will try to hire from my community as much as possible uh but it's probably good in terms of alignment and being on the same page that when you're looking to hire from within the community they're already to to bring someone up to speed on what an AI automation agency is alone it's enough of a job and say like this is what we're trying to do these are the kind of like the tools alone like hey we build things with voice flow we build things with these other these other automation platforms as well for them to be on the same page that must be a a big help for you not having to I mean it's like its own vetting process right of them being in there and already already knowing stuff so um it's good to know that that sort of stuff is being is being valuable and we do have the the Vets Community which you're a member of um so if you're in the if you're my accelerator and you're looking to to get around the likes of likes of Mark here um we have the the Vets Community for people who have made money they're they're really contributing to the community or they have a ton of skills and information that they can provide as well yeah it's a really good Community because in the vest Community sometimes I feel like the dumbest person and that's when I feel really good cuz that means there's a whole new thing haven't thought of or a new tool I haven't seen before um I think someone on that Community recently just dropped a link to something called air. it's like a sales rep that's like on the phone automated cold Outreach I would have never found that on my own like there's little nuggets you're going to pick up if you're active on it actually contributes yeah I mean that's that's how we're trying to position us like if you're looking to start an AI business this is probably the place to be probably the best place to start yeah I mean without like I'd like to if anyone has somewh better I'd like to hear it so I can check it out and and take notes but I like to comfortably say that we're trying to make the best possible place on Earth for people who want to start an AI business to be around the right people get the right resources be to ask questions directly to me and my team and other people like yourself so that's the Shameless plug of the accelerator and I'm really fortunate enough to have have Mar as a member of that and who's really crushing now so and I just wanted to touch on because I did the school route so I did AI through school so I did learn through there and back then it was super scalable cuz things weren't moving very fast there's something called attention that is all you need came out in 2015 there was kind of like the moment where GPT became possible I learned all the boring stuff on how that works but things weren't changing then but every single day today things are changing so if you go to school for AI you'll have a solid Background by the time you graduate in three years but when you go to actually now build your tripa the whole environment's changed you don't know what skill sets are useful what tools are useful so the reason why there's value in these kind of communities in your channel is textbooks are irrelevant the moment they're published now with this kind of content it's vibrant so you see in one two months what you're doing right now is obsolete you're going to Pivot and the whole Community can pivot with you so that kind that's the value there yeah for sure that's why I mean the workshops three times a week is like we put so much frequency and and sort of push behind that because we just want to be hitting bang bang bang as soon as soon as anyone jumps into the community you see the entire gallery of all the different workshops we did and you can see the sort of stuff that okay most recently we're talking about this kind of chatbot or this kind of system that you can sell clients so um I want to probably touch on given your your background and sort of the broader scope I think a far barder than my myself to give a bit of perspective for people who are looking to build these AI businesses moving forward and you've obviously adapted a lot of a lot of what you're going to say is obviously ingrained in your strategy of of staying Nimble but where do you see the AI space going where do you see AI businesses uh going and and how to really build the best one and the most resilient one over time number one thing I think one year from now a lot of things are going to change I was give an analogy that might help people so if you pay for chat gvd plus and you go right now and you enable everything you're going to see there's I think browse with Bing there's Plus there's Advanced Data analysis and then like there's a default there's going to continue to be I think now DOI just came out there's going to continue to be new dropdowns until they all turn into one drop down where it's no longer multiple tabs it's one default that can read csvs use plugins not just three all of them at once and things are going to change drastically from that standpoint so if you think even broader now everyone's talking about zap yourm make.com what happens when you can access gbt plugin through an API where they've already packaged all that workflow in one little app that you can use for free for now what happens when you can do excel analysis through that same API call in the next year you're going to have to think really big because everything's going to change things are going to consolidate so right now everything's branching out to 8,000 tools eventually it's going go back to five tools it always happens com bubble a million new Dooms then eventually four Mega Giants so we're in that phase where everything's going to converge so if you can start like hopping onto it and I think Consulting is really helpful because when you're watching that space unfold you don't have to overinvestment out in in in sort of two years what what are we going to be doing as AI businesses and am I response to that was someone sharing a YouTube video about someone saying like the AI High Po and they usually end up selling you something at the end anyway but talking about the future of AI business and there's all these these Trends and things that are going to happen over time that's going to make it harder for us as AI business owners and and my response was look you'd rather be in the in the game like I'm not worried about my business at all really because I know that we'll always be on the front foot and there's always going to be some need and there's always going to be demand for these kind of things and as you see there's new things coming out all the time and as long as you're on the front foot and you have the right right team behind you and you have the right sort of Vision to be able to stand up above the mess and and like you say have see the bigger picture you're going to be able to continue to Pivot and position so it's not like you starts on something and you're stuck in that forever staying Nimble and even if you do have a solution that you run for a while it's going to continue to add things on to it but the biggest defense for you as as a business owner as these things start to change is having a business and having money under you so that you are able to and some momentum that you are a lot more insulated from the changes right so if you have $200,000 stacked up by the time any of these big changes happen then you can sit back and go okay let me now analyze the chess board again and do what I just did before so you have anything on that on that sort of strategy because i' be interested to hear hear your take yeah 100% so I think what you said was spoton in terms of being able to one build that little treasure chest of cash to keep you Nimble from a business standpoint I would also argue that from a business standpoint your clients help you innovate so when they ask oh but can it do this but what if it can do that and then your initial response is like oh my gosh like I I do not want to continue this call I don't know how to do this thing that pushes you to have to figure out the thing or find a new framework that no one talks about that was released by one person in Southern India that You' never saw before and now you're going to go through the whole repo and realize oh my gosh I can actually build this so if you have clients and you have a business L close exactly they're going to be your way forward so if you have that you're looking at the space from 50,000 ft in the air and you start generating money so you're not obsessed about how do I deliver this chat bot or how do I make this chat about respond properly you're thinking bigger picture how do I automate how do I make an SEO agency's workflow completely streamlined end to end you're asking those questions at month six to eight if you're actually going hard at this so you actually have to start out how do I connect stacky guy to bot press before you get to how do I automate our entire industry so that's kind of make my two sents there as well for sure you I think it's that incremental process of of get getting that foot in the door like you say and I mean the more clients you you stack up the the more you have to sell these new things to so when you do get to that point when you need to Pivot and you come up with okay this is the way things moving I think this is the next thing we need to build you've got the big war chest you've got all the past clients you've done good work for hopefully you've delivered and they're all happy with you or most of them are happy with you then you can go back and say right well this is the next thing and this is what we're we're looking to to move on are you interested in it and really and you have a soundboard right you can go and say hey hey hey Mike this is something we've been looking into would you guys be interested or have any feedback on it and you have that listing po post and sort of not an echo chamber but a soundboard to really bounce things off so and I'd say like right now there are some clients building AI tools that are asking for our AI advice on how to make their tool better it's weird but people want to want help to make their AI tool better so I get to learn about their entire back end and how it works it gives me a better perspective on how things are being built it just it's this amazing feedback loop if you just start the way there well uh I think we'll we'll call it there it's been a very insightful discussion Mark I appreciate you coming out and safe travels back to Canada he's had a bit of a a wild experience while he's been here I'll if you want to get the full scoop on why he's over here in the sort of wild goose chase he's head since he's been here then you can hop in the accelerated Community or in the free community you might be able to Ping him too but yeah appreciate you coming on I'm very very happy to hear that you've de to make a significant amount of money 57,000 in Revenue so far with this and I'm excited to see where you can continue to go in the in the Truffle space and elere yeah I'm going to kill in Truffles man but no thank you for inviting me um happy to be the first hopefully not the last I'm sure not the last um and yeah if you're in Dubai you're killing it name's your guy so uh thanks like yeah this is the this is where we get to give back to to mark for sharing a story um if we have any socials we want to put up on screen if you want to get in touch with Mark but more importantly uh any place we can find your business so that if people are looking for AI Solutions and they want an expert like yourself maybe they don't want to go to morning side but they do want to go to Mark I think you're better presented to me then uh absolutely we'll put your links to your business in the if you want to do a little pitch here in terms of sure you're expert at and what you can help with no problem um so again I operate prompt advisors.com uh we specialize in large language models fine-tuning them security actually building web applications pretty much everything across the board and obviously teaching and Consulting so that's kind of our our main bread and butters multiple but uh we're multif focused for a reason because everything feeds back to to each other but yeah I think I'll also come up with my own uh I have my YouTube name already it's going to be artificially h human artificially human Okay so hopefully by the time this goes out then I have that set up okay well we'll have all the links for him down below um and please after this if you want to give back to the channel give back to me H down there just at least check a site out and and see if there's anything interesting for you there and if you do have a story like marks maybe not on on the level that he's got which is uh pretty impressive but if you have had some success with your AI automation agency um myself I'd love to hear from you what what you've learned so you can share back to people in the same kind of format um and also to give us some light on your business and your personal brand because some if you have some very cool person stories and the stories for your business are just as cool so if you do want to get in touch with me and and P hop on the hop on the channel um for those reasons and you can get in touch with me there'll be a form in the description um but aside from that Mark it's been a

you're going to get to see behind the scenes how I plan things out how I've built it and what platform I'm using and how I'm getting it ready for deployment and the kind of automations that I've built off the back to really expand the value of this solution for my clients this video is actually episode three of an ongoing Series where I take an AI automation agency from 0 to 10K per month in Revenue all in the space of 30 days and if I fail I have to pay someone in the comments under one of these videos $1,000 I'm super excited to finally be getting this video out to you all because I know that the service delivery aspect of building an AI automation agency is often the most difficult part for many of you especially if you lack a technical background so I think for you to be seeing the behind the scenes of me and my process for building and delivering these Solutions is going to be super valuable for many of you and you get to see the the stages but also the troubles and and issues I've had along the way and I think I can give a lot of really valuable information back to you but this video is going to be broken up into into a few different sections so feel free to skip around as you wish I'm going to be starting off with the planning phase where I was using figb to create sort of a layout for the chatbot so it's important for you to know how I've done that then I carry that over into the building phase where I'm using a chatbot building platform and automation platform so you get to see both of those platforms that I'm using there and how I was building it then I go into a a little quick demo of showing the the sort of early stage of this chatport and how I was using it live on Instagram to show the appointment hitting capabilties so you get to see that as well then I have some clips from my review calls and update calls with the clients where they gave me feedback and I was showing them the the product and the feedback was not always great and then at the end of the video I'm going to be giving you a full breakdown of the system where it's the chatbot the Automation and the database of setup so you get to see my entire AI appointment setting system sort of laid out for you to look at and take inspiration from so it's a lot to get through obviously I'm really excited to get into this so let's go today is Service delivery day I going to be working on planning my service delivery for my first client of three I've sort of prioritized them based on who I think needs to be worked on first so I'm going to be working on one of the first I'm having to speak quietly because my my videographer editor is still asleep here but um he's catching up on some uh necessary Zas but I have to first I'm going to go for a ride on my motorbike get a little bit of fresh air get some sunlight in my eyes go do a little bit of meditation at the beach then I'm going to come back and head into my first work block where I'm going to be working on planning um planning the chat bar planning how I'm going to approach it you guys are going to see all of that and then you're also going to see me start to build my d my prototype my V1 for this client as well so very excited let's get stuck into it going to do some meditation get a bit of sunlight in the eyes and then we're going to be good to get back and get into work so I'm now onto Service delivery as I mentioned and I'm starting with my first client that I'm going to be really planning this out I've got to plan for what I want to do today firstly I'm going to be looking over the notes that I took when we got on our call so I've got a notes on on all the things that he wants to the criteria that he uses and sort of General notes about his business so I have a good clear outline of what he's actually doing and how I can build a system around it which is key secondly I'm going to be writing up a sequence of questions and really a criteria based on what he told me so how I'm going to structure this conversation and how I'm going to be sort of like the the preliminary steps before writing the prompt that's going to be doing the uh allocation of where the user goes to product so if you're not familiar with what I was doing in the PRI episodes we are creating an AI appointment setting system which has kind of become less of strictly an appointment setting system but more of a product qualifier and closer a AI qualifier and closer is one of the terms I'm using for it yet I still haven't decided on what term I want to use but that's kind of what I'm saying this sort of stuff is an AI qualifier and closer so it basically qualifies the prospect for one of your given offers and then we close them on that Prospect so if they're ideal for your top tier one-on-one coaching they will try to close you for that that but if you're not they'll also sort of qualify you for a different offer and say look they ideal for the uh the free training we have so qualify and closer that's sort of the process that we're going through I'm then going to be taking that plan of the conversation and the criteria and I'm going to actually building out the conversation within the chat bot Builder I'm using for this particular project by the end of the day today the idea is to have a working demo a a V1 ready to send over to the client to check and give some feedback on and I'm also going to be creating a business account for setwith ai.com on Instagram that I'm going to be able to set these chatbot up so that I can send it over as a real demo to my client and say hey here's what it's going to look like when people interact with it I'm going to put up a story that's his DM me grow what you can do to test it is actually reply to that story saying grow and they're going to have a chance to really see it in action so that's my plan for the day you're going to get to see me go through all of these different steps I'm going to document as much as possible so that you're fully on the same page as what I'm doing here and how you can use the same kind of process to do it with your own clients so I just planned out the conversation for this chat bot using my notes from the the call I had with the client so I've got a bunch of information here on about what they needed and what they don't and I've been able to convert that over to a fig Jam board which is laying out the entire conversation um at least I've just done the top row so you can do it based on if they say yes over and over or that like the ideal customer I've just done it on the top row I can do some filling out later but this is actually laid out a lot of the variables that have being captured the kind of times when the AI is responding and times when I've actually just hardcoded a responses so I'm going to show you a little bit of a look through that now so here you can see I've got a trigger so this is what I'm using to trigger it and then we have sort of the blue is going to be the user and obviously the gray is going to be the AI or the the chatbot sending it so iPhone colors is just to make it easy I have these things that are these purple diamonds which where catching a variable so this is going to be for something like the monthly Revenue variable this is going to be the uh monthly Revenue goal Etc so this kind of color coding and layout makes it very very easy to see what's happening and where so um I've laid this out this is the top row obviously so when there's a question like this have you started your online coaching business yet yes no or other so this is giving sort of building in resiliency and and flexibility within the bot at the base level when I'm planning it because they could say yes they could say a no or they could say an other so I'm going to set up an AI system that's going to allocate them into one of these and then I can easily uh lay this out and see visually how I'm going to handle each of those different scenarios so this has been a a very quick sort of 20 30 minute thing to do and then here we have the final bit of uh the product matching system really so it's going to be going to three different offers you're going to be able to route in all of the different trees as they get built out on these lower halves of the tree and they're all going to Route into this in order to give them the outcome and send them to the link that they need to see so that's uh that's a quick look at how I'm laying this out I haven't eaten yet and it's uh it's 1:20 p.m. so I'm going to shoot up grab some food probably go to the gym and then come back and get into actually building this and fleshing out a few of these other sort of trees that are not necessarily on the yes route will the perfect rout so going to jump into that now so for this particular project I'm trying out a bit of a new platform for me which is called called chatbot builder. a I'm going to leave a link down there if you want to check it out but this is basically a combination of mini chat and and AI features so I can do Min chat kind of Integrations where it's through Instagram or through Facebook messenger chat Bots and things like this very easily but I can also have the AI features that I need now um it's definitely not the not the flash platform at the moment it's under constent development but for the purposes of this video where I need a easy to deploy social solution it has been a good enough platform for me to be able to create a lot of the things I needed to do so things like people always on my on my case about oh like you've changed bot building platforms this and this pick the platform that's the best for what you want to do and in this case because voice flow and Bot pressy Integrations with social platforms are a lot more difficult I needed to choose something that was allowed me to rapidly iterate on my product and for me to connect voice flow to Instagram at the current stage they're working on some templates and things like this to be able to connect it easily but for the purposes of this platform I chose what was easiest for me and that is what you should do every time you do a build don't be dogmatic about one platform or another and don't get on my case when I recommend men you other software I'm not even recommending it I'm just saying that's what I use so if you want to check it out go ahead and do that for social deployments I chose to do it because it was easiest and trust me for this kind of challenge I'm going to choose the easiest platform to build what I need to build so in this case using chatbot builder. going to be linked down there and I think I can get you a discount code as well so if you want to use that go ahead but if you don't want to use it then you can try whatever else you want to use so that's just my disclaimer there all right we're getting into actually building the chatbot now so I've laid out the whole conversation I've got a very very clear layout and I've actually done it in a bit of a different way the last time it's laid out in kind of iPhone colors and I've made it very very clear what is the user which is the chatbot and then where I'm saving the variables and what and so on so going to get into actually building it now on the chatbot Builder application that I'm going to be using you guys are going to be able to see some shots over the shoulder of me building this now when I was filming this in Thailand I did get buried under a ton of other work so the case study kind of went on the back foot but I did get to the point where I was able to show you a demo just in the next clip after I'd got to Spain so I may have gotten busy and forgotten to do the demo Mo while I was in Thailand but I've got time now we're here in Spain free beautiful near my baaya and I have the demo ready to go on my phone so I can actually show you the real world like use case and example of me using it within the native Instagram app which is all ready to go it took me a little bit of playing around but we're able to get it working now I've sent this over to the clients they're pretty happy with it got a few edits to make but we're going to be running through an actual over the shoulder demo so you can see exactly how this is working and the kind of look and feel of how someone using this would actually be interacting with it so we can just cut to that now so here's my Instagram profile for the business I've put a nice Instagram story so here's my brother and me having a sangria in uh in Malaga today but I can DM this Cooper and it's going to trigger the conversation so I've sent the message wait for a second bam there we go hey Liam thanks for reaching out my name is Jake and I'm on a Cooper team we're here to help fast check you to the results here after I've got a few coups that I need answered to make sure you're good fit for our program is that cool sure it is awesome man won't take long firstly what to most important Fitness goal I want to lose weight that's awesome you're in the right place then Cooper's Trilogy method has program has helped hundreds of men to lose weight and achieve their fitness goals what's the biggest struggle when it comes to achieving this goal nutrition workouts or other mainly nutrition for me new mainly nut for me so we're able to collect information all the way through here and this is an AI response that's actually meant to respond to uh what they've actually said so that's a pretty common issue for our students the trilogy method is proven strategies and systems to help you improve your nutrition and get it sorted on a scale of 1 to 10 how ready are you I'm about 8 out of 10 so again very conversational it's actually replying to each of the messages that it's sending in a in a personalized way before asking an actual follow on question now there's a you will notice that there's not many much of a delay between each of these but we're actually able to set that up to be greater and future so that's one of the things a client wants actually uh excellent we can definitely get you some killer results in Cooper Trilogy method um what's motivating you to take action right now my wife will leave me if I don't lose weight so thr a bit of a curve ball seeing if the AI can uh can handle it yep building a warrior mind and body is key to gaining confidence in overall health how much have you invested financially in your personal development let's say I've done about $500 and now we have to wait a second because it's doing the final step of actually matching up all of these responses and let's try to match it up against what the ideal offer is for them so should take a second we've actually got two AI steps that are happening here first is the matching and then the second is matching up the correct link to create the button with so you're going to see a button in a second as well that's a great start investing yourself as the first step towards achieving your Fitness goal that's where my question's done based off your answers you're an ideal candidate to start working Cooper 101 transforming your mind and body towards your goal of rapidly rapidly towards your goal of losing weight your motivation level on the fact you've already invested um and your personal development shows you're serious about this Etc so all good and now I can click this button they've been qualified they check out they're good for the program based on our criteria and it takes it two at this point it's my uh it's my booking page but in future it's going to be the client one I just need to swap the link out so pretty happy with that so far I've sent it off to the client and he wants a couple edits I think we're going to add in some delays so it's going to have like a time delay between when they actually send the message and when the first one's ends back and we can add some delays in between each of them and then we can also add typing delays so it's going to look like it's typing away um and make it seem a lot more humid and natural so couple more edits to make I think I've got one thing I want to work on tonight that you might be getting to see in a bit is how I'm actually going to connect this up to a CRM style um hub for all of the conversation and and leads to go and I'm going to be tracking all of these different uh responses that they're giving and putting in a different column so I'll have this Ultra uh powerful resource of data on each of the customers that are chatting to it and then I'm going to show that to the client and really get them excited for the next phase of this which is actually putting this into practice getting this live in the on their Instagram and being able to collect this data and do retargeting and onward messaging essentially after we've closed the conversation or if they haven't moved forward and book the call we can actually start retargeting essentially so very excited to get that going I'm going to show you guys as much of that as I can but for now I need to do a ton of work on the other stuff and it so with the demo that you just saw I actually sent that off to the clients and I got a bit of a negative reaction from one of them and I I want to mention this right now because it's really important for you all is that when he was sending over sort of not fully finished Solutions and it's like this is hey this is a an update on how we're going make sure you tell them that it it is a it is a prototype right tell them the current stage that it's in because I sent it off to the client and I didn't give enough context on what it could and couldn't do and I know he sent me back a message and it was just like oh yeah that's that's that's cool man like really is really not interested in the most polite way and I could have fixed that by prefacing the current stage of the bot and the things that it couldn't do cuz when I later went through I could look on the back end and see the conversations that he had had with the bot it was just like he was doing all the things that it didn't yet wasn't yet able to do so he got a really bad idea or sense of what it could actually do and I could have fixed that and he kind of went cold for like a week or two and I wasn't really able to re-engage him to keep the project moving but thankfully with enough updates presented uh and new new features and new fixes to basically address all of those issues I was able to get them back on board get both of them excited don't know if I mentioned it yet but I did have the three clients I've kind of just focus on two currently because they have the most possibility for me to be able to get referrals after so that's going to get me to my first paid client so I'm really focusing on these two initially so that's just a little bit of value gold whatever you want to call it um that when you are presenting the solutions to clients and they're not fully baked and you're just giving them an update make sure they know the limitations of it so that you don't turn them off and think that you you're making something really not good that's never going to be able to be put to use in their business and as I just said In that clip there at this stage I just built out the chatbot and I was pretty happy with the things that it was doing now I just needed to set up the ability to take the information that I was collecting because conversation is going to be a huge I mean it already is but it's a growing Channel by which businesses and customers communicate and what we're doing is setting up systems to extract the the the information from those conversations and we're going to be logging that to essentially a CRM so I'm in these these next steps in between this clip and the next clip I built out an air table CRM which you're going to get to see at the end and I also built out some make.com autom that were able to take the information from the uh from the chatbot buildout put it into air table and then do a bunch of cool things like cleaning the data up categorizing it classifying it and stuff so you'll get to see that in the next clip now so I'm here in a beautiful dorf look at it stunning um have my last sort of bit of my my travels for this year but getting into the good stuff of actually attacking this problem head on so um sort of had a bit of a lack of focus over the past couple of weeks um just with a lot of stuff going on so I haven't necessarily been able to do the the work that I've been meaning to do on a lot of these uh case study clients but I have just over the past day or two put in a ton of work in terms of getting the air table working very very well a lot of classified data I have a full uh lead cleaning system setup that's going to prep the data so that it's ready to use um and also a lot of human handoff features as well so we have human handoff all through here in case the person who's contacting the bot tries to get funky with it so big updates we need to push um trying to get this thing back on track the clients are all very very excited to hop on a call so you should be able to see a call very soon of me having a chat demoing What I've Done um and I'm really excited to show them because I think it's a massive upgrade from what I've been doing and this is something I want to make sure you guys are all doing when you are working with your clients particular these free ones where they don't necessarily have that much skin in the game is make sure that when you're doing an update you're pushing a big one every time not just a little one because it might be a free offer but what you are the cost to them is going to be these calls that you're having with them right and then going through the revisions and checking it over and not being happy with it that is a cost to them you need a minimize that so make sure that the revision is big and it provides a ton of value it's like wo this is a big upgrade he's really putting in time and secondly making sure that those calls are sort of infrequent as possible so you're not taking up too much of the time um we're we're basically ready to start getting this thing live and I'm super excited to show you that so you're going to see a call with some of these clients very soon um and then I'm probably ready to put this live on their accounts so super excited I'm really really happy with how a lot of this has turned out and I think we're getting towards a sort of 80 90% solution that can handle most of these different conversations that going through and also this lead Stu I love this so very excited okay so at this point there was a major update that had pushed and it was a very very necessary one to make the leap from complete sort of garbage and not really being anywhere near uh production grade to being a lot closer to that point and really just needing a little bit of real data to to be able to get there so I put a number of updates into the chatbot and and the thing that I mentioned just at the end of that clip there of getting it to that 80% solution this is something I've been really big on recently and I'm pushing to a lot of people within my accelerator within on Twitter and things like this is that AI technology right now and the stuff that you're able to make in a lot of cases an 80% solution in terms it can handle 80% of the workload that a a human would normally do is a great place to look to really aim for so this appointment setting system I think it was sort of a philosophical switch in my head instead of saying I need to make this thing so good that it can answer everything and be able to definitely respond to every kind of query and an answer that they get given two let's try to set something up that can handle if they were to fly down the M and answer how we expect on every question and just sort of go QA QA Etc ideally let's get 80% of the people to go down that path and then if they sort of go outside of the expected conversation route and they ask a question or they um they say something stupid Etc let's snap the bot out of that and let's send it off to a human so this is what I'm calling the 80% solution and as you saw in that clip there there's actually a human handoff which was the big update on this particular push that I sent over to the clients which is a part of the prompt which is saying if if you detect the that they are not answering the question properly they're being stupid they asking if you're a chat bot or you're an unro of the answer then reply with the word human h m and all capitals and then I do a conditional check just after it saying if the output from the AI task was human then transfer this bot or transfer the conversation to a human so the good thing about this chatbot Builder platform is that it's very easy to use and integrated with all these sort of inboxes that you need across different platforms and it's got very good management of Bot conversations with conversation so one of the built-in features is that you can hand off to a human very easily so I've basically set the chatbot up to be in any case where it's unsure or there's a potential for them burning a lead where lead said something stupid or it's getting a little bit unsure to just be safe push it off to a human and step out of there so that then in the inbox we can be notified when there's a new question that needs answering and we can try to close that via a regular human appointment seter instead so big difference there is this this human handoff concept going for the 80% orig initially if you are building these kind of solutions then i' recommend you go for the 80% I mean you use a customer support example say for customer support chat but if you can get 80% of them handled with this with an AI knowledge base and then you take the other 20% and you say hey could you please get in touch with the customer support team at this email so you're still slicing off 80% of what the customer support team was usually handling but now you're handing off the trickier ones in order to not really piss off the customer essentially and handing the off to a real person to answer now people say oh we want the human touch business it's AI is not what our customers want but if you think about it in most cases if you can answer someone instantly and give them the information they need is that not benefiting the customer so in 80% of the queries where it's General FAQs and you can answer them and give them the information they need instantly AI Solutions like this are good for the business and good for the customer as long as you have that built-in where it's able to send them off to a human when they actually need it so big update on this uh I've also got the make automation set up which is pulling all the information from the air table classifying and cleaning it I'm going to go go a little bit in more depth at the end of the video on how that adack system works so stay tuned for that okay so and off the back of these updates and this was something I was using to really keep these guys interested and sort of engaged in this possible build for them is to mention hey every couple of days and say hey I've just pushed this s this update here's what I'm working on next really being communicative as much as possible and it was at this stage that I used the updates that I pushed which such as the air table the make automations I even had kly booking tracking set up as well so I put a lot of work in and really updated this to be a lot closer to ready to deploy and so I used all of these updates as sort of incentive and and interest to get these uh my two clients two main clients uh onto a call so that I can really start pushing this towards production and pushing towards my first paid clients essentially so um I was able to do that I'm going to show you some of the calls in a second here these calls were like half an hour 40 minutes long so I'm not going to show you the whole thing but I'll show you some clips of the one that went well and some clips of the one that didn't go too well so that you get an idea of both sides of things but essentially I'd used the updates that I'd pushed to incen device and and say hey look I want to give you a demo I want to give you an update and I was able to collect a ton of valuable info back from each of the clients and what they needed changed and the key question on these calls was what will it take for you to be R ready to put this live how much more proof do we need and what kind of proof and uh what kind of safe environment do you need in order to be able to start deploying this on account so I got that important information and that sort of led me on to the next step which I'm going to go on at the end of the video what up it's good man how you so here's the the updated version it's getting pretty hefty um but what we have is a couple key updates yeah because again like AI is huge I right now I'm still trying to figure out where exactly I want to align with my business and what my unique offer is different I really think that I really love the AI and how that's going to grow because it's only growing exponentially now until the next like 10 20 forever yeah definitely man shot me over that demo I can just send it into my group chat right now with all my students see how they like it sweet okay that should do the job they trust me okay all righty mate uh really appreciate your time hope that's been been worth your time and I'm really excited to get this thing going yeah definitely man I'm excited I want to get this rolling because uh damn these Saturday doing it yeah so okay well man enjoy the rest of your day and I'll have a t probably early tomorrow morning my time all perf man man later see what's good bro I'm good bro how are you I'm doing well good to finally get on a call I think we've been been chasing this down for a while but uh I've got some good stuff to show you so we can uh we can get stuck into it awesome bro let's do it yeah man I mean it looks it looks very clean very nice very clean all the setup um I think I'm going to be just 100% transparent yeah that's cool when I was playing with it at first I was not too impressed okay sweet then I'll send you a few screenshots of the guys that have closed and then yeah man I mean once we start closing a few I'm down to try with few influencers I love that idea because it's using the the power of personal brand In Their audience to basically milk their leads and pay them awesome well it was a pleasure I got a meeting I got to I'll send you those screenshots I'm excited sweet for sure um this is a thing we working with this new tech that people are going to be very resistant to it so he doesn't seem too hot on it like at all so um I just you just have to keep like you just have to keep going like I mean I just I think it's the the fact that it's like an AI and he's expecting human level conversations I think because he doesn't necessarily have massive lead flow because he's not a massive like influencer they still feel very attached to each lead that comes through whereas if you've got like two 300 people heading you up every week like you don't these are just numbers to you at some point and you just want to like sort them out get them in your funnel get them sold so I think working with these smaller guys particularly like this guy um the smaller ones makes it a bit more difficult because they want to be more personal and they like each lead is a lot more of their potential earnings than uh than like the 300 first lead for a big guy each week so um interesting and yeah that was hard to get him on a call it probably be hard to get him on again but um I think this guy will fomo in if I just focus on the other guy and uh get that going and sort of give a bit some of the feedback over from him to this guy and uh use that data because we just need data we haven't even seen this thing live yet so I need to figure out what the like out rate is basically excuse my language but um basically the rate of which this thing either Burns a lead and and says something stupid or they or they stop replying or it has to snap out of the conversation send it to a human um that rate is going to be key cuz if I can get a Sol like 70% of people shooting right down the middle and get into the conversion event um then then we're going a pretty good spot so head update it's midnight Midnight here been a put on a big day not going to lie but um get some shut ey and get back to it tomorrow it's probably going to be it for episode three not going to lie I think uh we're going to the point where I'm basically you're good to go and put this thing live on the coach of coaches students account first I'm going to get that thing going get some data back and then next episode's going to be really focusing on getting this thing live getting data back and transitioning that to getting our first paid client so big episode next one really rub me to the road putting this thing to the test so yeah I'm excited and I know the hard work ain't going to end yet but um that's just how it is sometimes so thank you for watching up to this point uh might have some other stuff after this depending but for this stage of of the challenge I think I'm going to wrap this episode up here that was the update call that I had with both of my main clients as I said there is a third one but I haven't really started developing or building theirs yet cuz I didn't have the biggest sort of onwards r new opportunities in terms of referral so I'm going to give you a bit of a run through the system that I've got set up for them and what I demoed on the calls so I'll show you that now okay so I'm going to be going through the chatbot layout the automation layout and the air table so first we're jumping in on my first client who was a coach of coaches so he's a business coach for online personal trainers um here we have the chatbot layout I I won't go into too much depth but I'll give you a quick rundown so we have sort of some of the prompting information I set some Sona prompts and fallback prompts Etc then I have the human handoff section here which is really important and I mentioned was a big up so if you want to take a look see at the human hand off there basically we uh determine if they're being silly if if they're saying something that's trying to break the bot then we hand off or if it's something that the bot can't answer or it's outside the scope of the conversation then we can transfer to human here um it goes through a couple questions um basically just asking the format is that we ask them a question so what is the monthly revenue for your business in the next or the goal for your Revenue in the next 6 months and then we're going to capture that thing that they say and then we're going to run it through the AI task here and then if it's a valid response then we can go through to the next one and we print out that as the AI output now if it isn't a valid response then we send it to human and then within the inbox of this chap board application we can actually allow the appointment set to go in and reply to them manually so you can see this thing sort of repeats over and over but the format is pretty much the same we ask the question we generate the response if it's a valid response then we go through and print that out to them as the response so it's quite personalized say we use some of the information that they've given us based off also the information about the business and we can say oh yeah we've gotten plenty of results for people who are making 10K a month HS personalized responses and then we go to another question as the format we go through all the way I do a couple API calls Etc but the key uh business of this app is really this uh this block here which is the uh offer matching section so it's going to provide all of the different responses so the constraint are they willing to change their budget Etc and then we're going to run that past the criteria and say if they have uh $500 on more to spend and are willing to change or they have a goal of reaching maybe 30k then you can send them this offer so all of this stuff is a little bit too in depth for the scope of this video um the templates for all of these are actually available to my accelerator members I I can't give away templates to the entire world um because that's going to one mess up my Challenge and it's also going to mess up all of the accelerator members who are using this template so if you want to get access to that we're only got a $97 per month plan so if you want to steal all my hard work over the past couple of weeks and start trying to sell an appointment sitting system to not only online personal but like other niches as well that need appointment Setters you can get the air table the make automations and this exact template all available as soon as you get into my accelerator so or we go through and then I've actually added in a lead capture here which is a key point so in order for us to track the information that we're getting through these different questions that we asked them we need to capture the lead at some point so that we can contact them right so I have at the end of it which I've moved to the front of it and the newer versions but at the end or at some stage in the chat bot I'm collecting their email and then I'm also collecting their phone number depending on what the client wants and and then at the end of it I have this API request and that's pushing all of the information over to the air table so um it's fairly straightforward again you just got to use the air table API and make a call um and that's sending it off to the air table which I can show you in a second so the air table looks like this I have my client one this is the coach of coaches and we have all the information here so we have Mike wasowski our lead we have uh his email we have the phone number we collected we have a bunch of information that we collected through the chat bot and this is all being populated once the lead capture is complete at the end so we have the goal the monthly Revenue we have the constraint that they said Etc so all the information from the conversation that we've collected is being pushed to this air table and then once we have that air table done we can send it over to make.com to do a lead cleaning really and and structure the data a little bit more which I can show you now then over on make.com I'm using a web hook that's connected to air table so as soon as in this automation section as soon as a uh a new client record is created I'm running the script which is a little bit of custom code um not too complex you basically just call in the the webook URL that's sending the data over to this uh make.com Automation and then it's going to look up the air table record based off what we got from the we hook then I'm going through and I'm using multiple chat GPT nodes to take the information from one of the columns say they ask okay what is your goal for your business in the next 6 months it's going uh uh I'd love to get to maybe 30k per month that would be great so instead of this big long string of information I can classify that down to maybe okay this guy wants to make in the range of 30 to 40K and then I can label that in air table as a select rather than as a natural language input which allows us to filter it and do all sorts of cool stuff and set up automations off the back of it so for each of the different fields and that I've collected from the chatbot and that the client has provided or that the lead has provided I'm cleaning the data step by step and at the end of it I'm pushing all of that data uh to the to the air table to update it so I can go back to air table and I can show you what the clean view looks like in this case so it's got uh monthly revenue and we' classified the constraint type and into either time skills family money Etc and we start to get these labels appear rather than having the natural language input so that's kind of the setup at the moment we go from the chatbot Builder we export all the data at the end we get a lead capture we push all the data to air table and then as soon as a new record is created in air table then I send it off to make.com and I go through those chat GPT notes over and over and over again and those are prompted to classify the information or to clean it up so for example this budget here if I go back to the grid view the uh the budget might be 2K or might be I'd love to do 2K or I have about 2k to spend instead of being the natural language input then we have this cleaned column the C and that's going to standardize all of it to 1,200 or using the same um layout of of putting a price down so that's the system for my client who is a coach of coaches a business coach for online fitness coaches this is the one for the online fitness coach so this is the actual the people that I was originally intending to Target and so this is a much more basic flow as you can see same principles apply I'm asking a question I'm checking if it was a valid response if not I transfer it to human and I'm collecting the information about what their this lead has I what's your Fitness goal what are you struggling with the most how much budget do you have Etc go through the whole process get to the end I do my lead capture I determine which offer is best for them then I capture the lead and then I send the information off the air table again so similar thing if I go to the second tab here you can see I've got a bunch more leads in here and this really ill illustrates the power of the me.com automation so if I go to the grid view you can see I have the status column which I'll go into in a sec but I've got all of this lead data so Fitness goal the natural language that they provided in Instagram biggest struggle how ready Etc all of this information that's quite messy and you can't do much with it then when we go to the make automation I'm using this exact process to classify a lot of the time so take a look at the response they give they gave here's the five categories we have we also have other if you can't categorize it but if they say they are struggling with their time management we can say that's a time constraint Etc and that gives us this really nice leads uh this really nice lead data instead of having it all messy like this I can swap over to my clean leads view which basically cuts out the non-clean columns and then I get this beautiful quite satisfying to look at um lead data so we have Fitness goal build muscle lose fat or both we have the the biggest struggle workouts nutrition or other how ready on a scale of 1 to 10 Etc and then we have the budget as well so this is a great setup for me to be able to get a lot more actionable data so that say I actually have a a Cly a conversion tracking setup so that when uh when they have sent a link to book so they get qualified for the the one-on-one coaching offer that's going to send them the link to book I can put a UTM tracking parameter and I can generate a unique ID so that when they send every person who gets sent a link to book it's going to have a unique identifier in it and then when they book with that unique identifier cly pings my Automation and make and it's able to update this status column here saying that instead of just the lead being arrived in the CRM it's actually being called booked so this allows us to schedule follow-up so say if the lead was sent the link but they didn't book The call after 24 hours or 48 hours then we can send a follow-up sequence after that so I can connect this to make again make.com again to send out some follow-up emails or SMS whatever I need to do in order to try and push them towards that call booking so this is the current state of it um I as I said all of the templates I can't go into it too in depth here this video will be 3 hours long but all the templates available to my accelerator members as sort of the the privil they get to get access to all of the hard work on this so that's the build currently for my coach of coaches client we are almost ready to start testing it in in the real world um I'm just doing a few little edits to make sure that I've got a a online fitness coach kind of personal trainer set up really dialed in that he can start to offer to his students and we're going to test it on a couple of their accounts first so that's all good on that side and I've just got a couple more things to do over the next few days in order to present that just drop it in the group chat and say hey this is an appointment sitting system we've got anyone want to try it we can get another couple people to run it live on the other side the client 2 which is a a personal trainer and online fitness coach themselves um they have just sent over a sales script CU I think they they want a few changes to the way that I'm answering the questions and where I'm posing the questions as well so I've got a little bit more work to do on that side before we can get it live but I'm in the process of taking that script that he sent and adjusting the the chatbot itself so being my all a open to what the clients want I've been very flexible throughout this whole process um and there's also for the coach of coaches he wants to get some follow-up sequences set up as well um because he doesn't have any and as students don't have any either so as I mentioned with this call booked idea where if they haven't booked for 48 hours and I can send a followup I'm going to be able to use all of this data say if their biggest struggle was workouts okay then they get sent this follow-up message as well so it's personalized say if they they had a budget deficiency we can send this kind of message so these kind of follow-ups is going to be key part to the uh to both sides of this really and I'm in the process of building out the final version so that we can start getting this live and I can start to secure my first paying client which are going to be referral so we're very close now um I want to sort of address the elephant in the room which is that I think the the 30 days is up and uh that comes down to me and I want to mention right now that uh these kind of projects you need focus and for me about the past 2 or 3 weeks I've been so scatter branded on my multiple different tasks and and projects really and commitments that I haven't been able to give this the the attention it needed in order to get it done in 30 days now of course I am going to have to cough up the $1,000 to someone who's commented I'm going to continue that competition for uh this video and I'll put it on the next video as well so once I finish a series someone's going to be getting that $1,000 so you can still win it if you want to comment down below you can go into the draw you can comment on the previous video and the episode before that and the next one um because the next one's ideally going to be me getting my first couple of paying clients and we're trying to wrap the challenge up by then so I didn't get the 30 days and that's cuz I didn't focus on it but I know all of you uh do not have multiple different businesses that are juggling and you don't have commitments elsewhere you don't have a YouTube channel so you should be able to focus and put a lot more effort and attention on it um the qu I like to use is I think it's Alexander Gran Bell the sun's Rays don't burn until they come into Focus you need to focus on this stuff in order to get any kind of results the building of this stuff is not easy but now that I've built this I was able to build it once for my coach of coaches clients duplicate it over to the personal trainer client and the modifications only took a few hours now once I've dialed it in even more the hard work is done and that's why going for this Niche specific and solution specific method is far more scalable because now I can roll solution out to potentially 5 or 10 people in the space of a week and then it's sort of just managing it Beyond there so I'm uh I'm happy with how things have gone I'm obviously a little bit behind schedule but I do believe that if you were to focus on it I could have got this done in 30 days but I'm probably going to extend this out to probably a 60-day um just because I've got my my focus pulled in so many directions so learn from me don't overcommit yourself don't run a YouTube channel and case studies and this this while it's great uh it doesn't really work well for trying to squeeze us out in 30 days so learn from my mistakes and all all your learned in this video and I'm really looking forward to getting started on the the next episode where I can get some money coming in and really wrap this thing up so if you've enjoyed and you've got any value out of this please I've put so much work into this and I continue because I know this is the content that you all want to see and I could make all these other videos but really this is the stuff that you you need to see and what's going to be most helpful in your journey so I appreciate you

for stuff by getting those clients into my world then I got access to other high pay clients which were 6,000 retainers for large SEO agency then I say okay fair enough it's uh 500 or th000 for implementing the system white gloves on are you actually giving away that 10 file or no yeah yeah that's free wow that's that's is a crazy amount of value what's going on everyone this is an interview with a student from my AAA accelerated Community which is my paid Community also have my free community as well but I wanted to post this and I'm going to continue posting student results on here just to really get the good word out about the kind of results and money people are making with the AAA model so um I really hope you enjoy it's going to give you an insight into some of the interesting lead generation methods that he's been using and I sort of go a little bit deeper on how he's delivering it and and really important things that you guys can take and and apply to your own AI automation agency so enjoy so Hans love you love you to see hope you're doing well thank you very much for coming on the channel I think a lot of people are going to be very interested in in the kind of stuff that you've been doing with your AI automation agency um so I want to get you on here just to have a chat and sort of share a little bit more about what you're doing because I think it's very interesting so if you can give us a little bit of intro on on yourself how you got into the community um and the kind of kind of business that you're running and stuff that you're selling yeah um Hans here I'm an engineer um started going into the AI automation agency world around Christmas uh 2022 and then continued on I didn't know anything about AI buts yeah I did know a lot about AI but I didn't have any clue about how big the world was so um I started to do content generation and blogging because I have been in SEO previously created a lot of blogs and I didn't like the content writers that were out there so I actually created my own content generation system um and then by expanding that I went into like this could actually become something that people would pay for in my opinion so started adding apis for SEO data and all that Jizzle and then I thought by the great Alex OSI give everything away and sell the implementation so give away the information sell the implementation and I went into some of these SEO Facebook groups because I also wanted to up my SEO game um so I actually went and paid for some paid groups I went into some free groups and then I just started adding on all the that I've made like I put on videos on what I've actually done and that catapulted me into getting more and more clients organically from from that and so that was just um that was a make.com scenario you're using it on right so just all all make based yeah awesome um I started yeah I started using make.com and then adding on air tables as interface so UI is air tables and then no code low code automation is in make um yeah I tried a lot like I also tried everything under the sun and I always come back to make because I I can always get it to work in make where all the other ones are always just a small tweak so make is the one that most of the time works that's why I use that I think that's good to good to mention as well and I I've always talked about when you when you're learning these skills and picking up these new skills it's important to pick a platform that allows you to get not only to be able to build all the basic stuff but provide you with enough depth where you can start with the really complex things like what you've built so how just an idea like sort of how big how many nodes were in your in your content thing because I know it took you quite a while to build right yeah um yeah I I build it out into five different scripts um I think the largest one was 82 notes um and then the regular size is around 50 to 60 notes um with a lot of iterators and aggregators involved in order to aggregate the data because when you're doing long form content you cannot just make AI write the whole thing you need to break it up in sections in order to control the uh the content flow so they're very big scripts and I think the column size in air tables is like 25 columns now for different information all the way through and in terms of the yeah input for this when you do you have some kind of input that people are prompting this this content generation system with or is there some other kind of input input uh provided to it yeah I I broke it down into steps because whenever I start whenever I got got into these content systems they were always lagging in some part and I wanted full control so I always start with keyword I also have a section for keyword research where we do vertical um analysis of keywords and a lot of stuff there but then the content part is take a back scrape U Ser data get all that back look through it and see what are the search intent and what are the top three writing about then we scrape either a website or YouTube video to get more content or more context for the AI to actually work off so in my opinion AI is just it has a huge knowledge base like it knows a lot if you think about like two bubbles it has all the knowledge in the world but it has zero experience once you turn it on and it turns on and turns off every time so you need to expand the experience bubble as much as possible by just giving it as much structured data as possible in terms of I want to go a little bit deeper on your uh on the Facebook side of things and how you're generating leads here and getting business so can you just walk us through a bit of your strategy about how you're positioning yourself when you're sharing things are you shooting like a loom video are you just directing to some sort of article and also when uh how people interacting with it and how are they reaching out to you and and how are you ending up to close that I went into these Facebook groups with where I I don't want to sell anything I don't want to pitch you can buy this or none of that because if the people who want to buy something from me if they're there they will come to me and they will ask me um so I just give away the information I I actually filmed like um six to 10 um videos ranging from five to 20 minutes in length where I just go through all the stuff that I did I did some high level videos where it's just the basics and the overview uploaded that and then I said this is how I did it I just want to share all the information that I have with you and hope you enjoy it um and hope you can use it so that's what I did and I just uploaded a few videos then a couple of days later I upload a few more every time someone asks in the group about Ai and block generation I hey it looks good um if you want to see one of my videos how I did it you can look at it here um and it's amazing how much traction you get when you actually give a lot of valuable content for free and I think the biggest takeaway in this setup is that when you give stuff away for free like the information the people who like first of all only 1% or less than 1% will ever use it like even though they say they want to use it they'll never use it so only 1% will use it and only like 10% of that 1% will actually succeed in implementing it um and that fractile of of all the people that just saw that video you will never sell that person your system anyways because they could do it themselves so they would never buy it it's a very good way I think so we're after the people who cannot do it themselves they just reaching out to you shooting you a DM separately and then you were I know you mentioned when weal when we talked prior that you had some sort of community that you were shipping them off to and then sort of sharing a little bit more can you tell us a bit about that yeah I like all all my scripts and all my I made tutorial videos for everything and instruction template for everything how to import everything and all that I have that in a community private community and I just put a link to it if they want access to it so it's free for all just go in join there and you can download it all and then for the people who want to like have me implemented then I say okay fair enough it's uh 500 or a thousand for implementing this system white gloves on um and then I'll do everything set it up for you um so there's not like I don't hide that I'm giving it away for free it's simply like if you want me to implement this for you because you have more money than time then I'm your guy okay and uh and what sort of numbers are you doing on that how long have you been writing that office specifically in terms of the content gen and and it's kind of final form that you think you've got it to how long have you been writing that offer for and and what s the results in terms of number of clients and revenue as well if you got from it I've been running it for like a month or so maybe a little more I've only sold like five or six people in the 500 to th000 range but the kicker is that those people know other people who also pay for stuff so by getting those clients into my world then I got access to other higher paying clients which were 6,000 retainers for large SEO agency and in another Facebook group that wasn't specifically on SEO I got access to capitalism.com for example because I posted some there and then someone wrote you might want to talk to uh to Ryan and his team about implementing some AI for them then I got into that world just by sharing what I do yeah so give value to the guys the Facebook groups and then they were able to connect you to some much bigger opportunities through that awesome that's pretty much it from the oranic size warm inbound Facebook groups are a very good way and it's something I have wanted to touch on for a while but great to hear and see you doing it and uh and doing it in a way that's that's not getting you banned from groups have you ever got banned from any groups or have you always been pretty careful about it no because I'm not like I never sell anything I just give away my Solutions so like the even the make scenario template as well or do you because giving away the template file is is a big STP right so are you actually giving away that template file or no yeah yeah that's free that's that is a crazy amount of value if they're getting that template and there's suddenly 80 nodes on their on the make account but I guess there's a lot of you need do need experience with make in order to be able to make make it work finally right so especially if you got it's like I have my free page where I put in like you can go and get I don't know if you know Harrow helper reporter out for example you can automate that as well I have an automation for how to automate that inside make and air tables that's an easier automation I have like levels right this is medium to uh to hard and so I'm not hiding that this is just cookie cutter easy and with four notes this is going to take some technical skill and uh where's your what's the feuture for hand here what's the future for your business how are you looking to scale up what are you hoping to do by the end of the year I'm actually um right now I am in a testing phase for how to productize Services the thing is that the custom world is is the custom world and I've lived in it both digitally and physically because I do interior design so I've done a lot of custom work as well and it's so hard to scale custom agencies or custom work so I've been right now I'm in testing mode um while doing this organic content uh thing I'm in gonna test like six different offers that I have productized like I can see that we can productize this this and this way and then I'm going to do Facebook ads run ads and try and test everything do cold email test all the offers and going to play crazy stupid because I don't know what people people want yeah like if I knew what people wanted then I would already be making a lot of money so I don't know what people want so that's why I've come to come to the conclusion that I need to test a lot of different things that I know I can productize and deliver at scale and then test my way into U into this excellent uh when it comes to actually getting that the the general versus the the niche downside I talk about this a lot and and it's good that you sort of come to the same conclusion on that um in terms of testing your your offers and where you looking to go from that is it going to be sort of you hiring a team to come in and deliver it and and I think I also should mention um for everyone watching that Hans is also working a a like full-time job and he's got kids so um this is if what he's been able to do in this time um in his in his own business while also juggling with the other commitments is is impressive because there's a lot of people who are who have nothing to do and they're barely getting to the point you're doing so I just wanted to mention that is it pretty impressive what you've been able to do so um are you hoping to sort of replace your your income full-time at some point or do you think this is going to be sort of a in tandem with your with your current engineering position this is uh my plan is to to scale up but I need to make at least 15 to 20K a mon month on the site before I can do a full switch um so that's why I'm I need like I'm hyper focused on getting productized Services out and running um because there's no way I can do that switch works so that's just my situation like I would do it completely different if I didn't have kids and if I was mid 20s I'm mid mid-30s I have a house on 500 square meters I drive a Tesla I work as an engineer um so that's a like lifestyle limit on how much I can downscale without saying hey let's move out of the house so the wife isn't that Keen right um so for every other uh person listening like make those big jumps early in life because it's just much more easy to do early in life you need to be more than focused when when you get later on in life and want to do do the switch especially when you got mortgages and kids and a wife that likes the house yeah well I think uh I think that's sort of um about all I wanted to cover on here in terms of the Facebook strategy your background and sort of what you've been able to achieve um I want to give you a chance to sort of P your services here and let everyone know what you do and how they can be in contact with you because that's also bit of value I can give back to you and your business is trying to get um more potential people because if anyone's in the in the in the industry for that kind of thing so yeah feel free to do your pitch thanks um so my pitch is I'm your guy if you want to have SEO content like SEO optimized content um for anything I've have done all the like automations and implementations with Surfer API data SEO I know H refs I I know all that world I've done implementations for large SEO agencies um so I can do that uh and then if you want low code to no code um aut ations that you can maintain yourself but just need to get built I'm pretty handy at that as well um and I think a lot of businesses would benefit from having these no code uh automations because then you're not riant on me forever you can actually get other people to maintain your your business as well okay and uh we got a website URL or Twitter anything that they can be hopping over to yeah it's uh scaleby tech.com right I I'll drop that in the Des you guys want to hit over and book in the C there'll be they'll be all in touch one last thing to touch upon um is that I don't think we hit enough on like in the automation world that regular businesses when you do custom automations it's you can pretty easily get trapped into vendors so I think a big selling point at least when I think about how to implement automation businesses is that going a low code or no code solution like if you can do it that way you aren't tied to that specific vendor and I'm not saying that I want to lose customers but I know that I might not be around forever and they might not like me forever and having your business business rely on one person or one company for all their automation that's risky in my opinion so having it built on systems that other uh people can maintain is Big Plus in my in my book for sure and I think that's a big selling point right if you're going to be putting these Services if you want to come in and say hey look I'm going to set these up in a way that allows you to and even we've done it sometimes at morning side as well in terms of saying we'll set this up and we'll hand hand the system over to you we'll actually train up your people in terms of using it so um that's ter do take a little bit of extra work and and we don't try not to do it too much because it is kind of resource intensive but for people starting out early on um definitely have that kind of offer offer available um to show that you really care about the business long term and you're not trying to like lock them in right yeah and and one one extra caveat on that is if you get into a relationship with a customer that you really don't like you can hand them off without like yeah burning them too much um you can say we it's good we like I can find some other people to help you with this so yeah I say just to keep that in mind because you will always run into customers that you don't want to have hanging around forever yeah the uh the retainers if you're locked into a couple month contract with with some people that you really don't like working with they can really Ru on your day so um yeah I uh really appreciate you coming on hand it's been very very helpful for the community I'm sure and um if anyone wants to get in touch with Hans and do anything related to content creation SEO Etc his links are going to be down below um and if you're in the accelerator might be seeing Hans insurance and value there too so I appreciate you uh so much h for coming on and enjoy your time Andy thanks bye later so that's about it for the video guys I hope you enjoyed and got something out of hans's interesting strategy and his story too that there's no excuse that you can't get results with this when he has a family and a full-time job and things like this so um I wanted to put out a bit of a a sort of announcement that if you have gotten result and you are making money with your AI automation agency and want to come on the channel in the same way that Hans has I can give you a bit of exposure for your business and really more importantly you can share uh your learnings and and the things that you can pass on to other people that you wish you knew sooner if you want to provide value back to the community that way and I can send some back your way VIA giving you exposure for your business and your personal brand as well uh then feel free to apply down below there's going to be a link to a form where

              "text": "what's going on guys welcome back to the channel today I wanted to make a video to address one of the biggest issues that I'm seeing among beginners who are looking to start an AI automation agency that is preventing you from being able to sign your first client now this is a very very easy fix once you've highlighted it and you have a plan to attack it with but I keep getting the same questions over and over and over in my community so I thought what better way to address it all in one go than create a video here because it's obviously a very very common issue so within this video I'm going to be identifying the problem for you I'm going to be showing you how you can get past it in the exact steps you need to take in order to solve this issue and at the end of the video I'm going to be walking you through the four most common beginner mistakes that I see when people are setting up systems to deal with this issue so I'm really excited to jump into this and I think many of you are going to benefit from this a huge amount because it's something that within my own case study it was an issue that I have to solve and it immediately made things so much easier for me to do I'm super excited to be getting this out because this is actually one of the key things that I had to fix in my 0 to 10K case study which is up there if you haven't seen the first episode but by fixing this part in the challenge it was able to basically instantly allow me to start signing clients so within a few days of making these changes that you're about to be walked through I was able to find three clients in two days so let's jump straight into it if you're new to the channel my name is Liam otley I'm the creator of the AI automation agency model I have my own AI development company and AI automation agency called Morningside AI we currently do around a hundred thousand dollars per month in Revenue I own and operate the largest community of AI automation agency owners and I also have the number one platform and resource for creating an AI business called my Triple A accelerator so beyond those we have over 35 000 community members all learning to start and scale their own a automation agency so this is where I'm getting all of my information from and I also do case studies and things like this on the channel as well so the information I'm about to tell you comes from my experience of running my own AI automation agency helping thousands of students within my community and running my own case studies to really walk with you step by step through this process of creating your own AI automation agency so the number one question I get in my community is this hey guys I've just managed to get my first couple of sales calls booked in but I have no idea what I'm supposed to say or what I'm supposed to do on these calls can anyone help now you may have been in this exact same position yourself I certainly was very recently when doing my 0 to 10K case study but this comes down to the the issue behind this is that you haven't actually defined your sales process you don't know what the customer journey is from a lead all the way through to a closed and paying customer so while the people asking these questions have obviously done something right in order to be able to get someone to book and a call they are missing sort of the structural underpinning that allows this entire process to work from start to finish and this is your sales process and this is something that you need to have established fairly early on in your process of starting your own AI automation agency now what does a sales process look like what's an example of it what are the different stages that you need to be aware of and how do you actually plan to make this as effective as possible so when it comes to creating the sales process or really a customer journey is what it really is many of you are going to have your customers starting as just a lead on a list a line on a spreadsheet and then your job is to move them through the different stages of your sales process you're going to take them from the list you're going to put it into some software maybe put it into your email Outreach software and you're going to send them a message what are you trying to do from that message to the next Point okay I might be trying to book a call with them next okay when I get on that call what am I actually doing okay I'm actually going to try and book them for another call and once I get them on the last call what am I trying to do I'm trying to close them but I'm trying to take this angle after the call I'm going to be sending them the contract via this and then when I close them I'm going to add them into slack like this so this is the entire sales process that you need to actually give real thought to how you're going to plan it out now taking this back to my zero to 10K case study I had the exact same kind of issue as many other people are asking these questions which is I would get on a call or I'd be ready and preparing for a call and I'd be thinking to myself okay what am I am I trying to close them on this call am I or my booking in another call hang on what am I actually going for the offer here am I really trying to close them or not so these kind of things not having them prepared before the call is going to put you in a terrible position because you don't even know what your aim meaningful by the end of it many of you have probably heard the saying to sell the appointment not the service so this is definitely applies as well and it goes to more your sort of Outreach side of things so when you're reaching out to customers and when you're making that first point of contact what are you actually what's your objective in that message and if you're doing cold email or you're doing a cold DMS on Instagram what is the objective of that first message and how does that play into your entire sales process so you need to write this whole thing down and go okay they are leads here then I'm going to contact them via Instagram and I'm going to send them this kind of message taking this angle with this kind of pitch right so it's getting very very granular with this now I'll put some examples up on screen that I got from my 0 to 10K case study well I really broke it down and said okay this is step one I'm doing cold email Outreach is step one the objective is for me to get a response back saying that they are interested thereby taking them from a a just a lead to a qualified lead meaning they are interested or have shown interest in my product and then once they've applied with yes okay then I'm going to send them some more info in the form of sending them to my landing page and then I'm going to push them also to book in a call so that's the next step I'm going to send the information and then I'm going to try to get them to book on a call and then when they get on that Discovery call I'm going to come with this sort of information and I'm trying to push for this kind of conversion am I trying to close them on the first call or am I trying to get a second call booked up and just collect information on that first call so that I can go for the close on the second one so there's a lot of different variables and a lot of different ways you can do this but it is so important for you to lay things out early on so that you know what you're doing to be clear your sales process is likely going to change a lot through the different phases of your business but for the time being I want to focus on you getting your first client and so the sales process for you getting your first client is going to be different to that when you're scaling and you're really doing numbers so at least for now this is what I would recommend for you to be able to sign your first client and at least this is what worked for me in the zero to 10K case study so the first step in your sales process is likely going to be some kind of cold Outreach via email Instagram LinkedIn Etc but the goal of that should not be to close them again you're trying to sell them their meat thing or in this case you're just trying to get them to reply that they are interested so don't put any links in it don't be sending them to your website don't do anything just say this is what I'm selling or this is the kind of results I can give your business or this is how I've helped to pry businesses within your Niche would you be interested in me shooting over a little bit more info and that's all you're trying to get that is the objective of step one which takes you on to the next step which is okay they've replied now they're interested and qualified lead what am I actually going to send them back in order to get them onto the next step and the next step is typically going to be booking in a course so maybe we can send some kind of demo I can go sure I'll shoot you over a demo of my system or of my my AI solution that you can take a look at in this loom video I'm going to shoot over a loom link to them and I'll also say if you want to hop in a call and learn more about how we can set this up for your business please book on a call here so that's step two we've got a response and then we're going to send them more info in the form of a demo with a link to book and with us afterwards so that's step one and step two complete and then when they're booking the call and you get to step three you need to be clear what am I actually trying to achieve on this call okay I'm going to be getting to know the client I'm going to be doing some exploration and sort of requirement Gathering and learning more about their business so that at the end of the call I can say hey that's great I'm going to go and put together a plan for you now and then we can touch base in a few days from now and we can get another meeting booked in and then we can move forward from there so the objective of your first call may just be to get familiar to get some information on their business and then to book in another meeting that you're hoping to close them on in the next few days so on the call you can say hey look let's book a meeting in for a couple days is this time work sure I've just sent you the invite and send the invite on the call and then on that second call you may be like okay I'm going for the close here the objective of this call is to close them in that case you can present them with your plan and your sort of proposal then at the end of the call you can say look if everything's all good are we happy to move forward and if they say yes then you can either try to contract and invoice them on the call which is a definitely a method that people like to use or you can say look I'll shoot this over in a second and then you can just send some follow-up emails if they don't reply so when you lay it out like that you can see that each part of your sales process has a very very specific function and a objective to it and I think this is the issue that many people have and they have this kind of questions hey look I've got them on the call but I don't even know what I'm doing I don't know what to say Etc so laying out your sales process like that is going to be a huge assistance to you as you go through the different parts of it and knowing what part as what function and where you're trying to take customers as soon as you get on those calls now I want to jump into the four most common mistakes that I see beginners make when it comes to creating the sales processes firstly and I did touch on it before but beginners tend to try to sell the service as soon as possible and sort of right off the bat they're trying to sell their services but in reality you should be trying to sell the meeting or in this case we're just trying to get a positive reply from them before we then go and try to sell the meeting so going straight in and trying to sell your services directly and hitting them with a cold hard offer is likely not going to it's going to give you terrible response rates because people don't like being sold straight away you need to really warm them up to the idea and make build up some trust because people are going to be giving you their money they want to trust you and be familiar with who you are so trying to sell them on a low lower risk and lower investment offer for them to just hop on a 15-minute call with you or just reply yes as a much lower commitment than putting some money down directly or doing something and buying your services directly so by dragging out the actual ask of what you're trying to sell them until the very end on that sales call you're getting them to commit and psychologically they're committing all of this time and mental energy of considering your services right to the very end they have committed that much they are much much more likely to convert and to be a paying customer this is actually a psychological principle that you can leverage in basically any area of your life the second issue that I see a lot is people talking too much about me me me or I can I versus ivat Etc making it too focused on you and not about them they don't care about you they definitely don't care about you as some random person in their inbox trying to sell them something so if you can try to make it very very focused on them and their benefits rather than a big sales pitch about your about your services right and that's why we try to pop into the inbox with a short message and saying hey there's this sort of thing I've helped the sisters would you be be interested in seeing a demo of this and how it can help your business right so again by talking about them as much as possible you're maximizing your chances of them actually giving you the time of day because as soon as they start reading a sales pitch and saying I do this and I can do this Etc yet you're selling them and they don't like that and you're like you're not going to get a response so try to focus on talking about them and how it can benefit them directly rather than you and all of the amazing things that you do and and why you're such a big shot thirdly another big mistake that beginners make is not researching the prospect before you get on a call with them now this is a super super easy and straightforward way for you to stand out above the crowd and I mean selling a lot of these AI related Services right now there's not even a crowd to stand above but it's just they're going to compare you against the other sales calls and other things that have been pitched to them in the past and if you were able to come onto the sales calls with not pages and pages and pages of notes or a clear strategy and a plan about how you're going to do this say hey I noticed this about your website and this about your Instagram and when I was checking out I noticed this this and this do your research and and really blow them away this is your chance to come across as someone who cares about their business and this is directly applicable from things like smma the clients the people and the businesses who are able to sign the biggest clients and get the big juicy retainers are the ones who are able to do super super personalized in-depth research in order to bring to the sales calls to impress the business owners say wow these guys actually care we haven't even paid them a dime and they've done all of this for us well imagine if we're actually paying them so if you can Channel some of that and do your research before you hop in the sales calls and really blow them away with the amount of attention to detail and the amount of care that you really have for helping them succeed and that's going to help you massively end these sales calls and finally number four is not leveraging multiple channels now when you are doing your Outreach and trying to contact leads and and as part of your sales process of we are hitting them and at what times you can go beyond just using one specific Channel I know it's very easy to go okay I have my lead list now I'm just emailing them until I get a response and I can close them but if you want to be particularly if you have a really really concentrated a good list of high quality prospects actually doing multiple Channel prospecting multi-channel prospecting and saying okay I'm going to match this email lead up with their LinkedIn profile and I'm also going to try hit them on a with a DM or I'm going to pick up the phone and call them you can have multiple different touch points and say okay I'm going to shoot them an email and then I'm going to call them two days later say hey I showed you an email did you get a chance to see or you can then follow up with a LinkedIn message hey I tried to call you today but you didn't pick up Etc and start to hit them on multiple different angles and you're going to increase the chances that you're going to be seen and then increases the chances that you actually sign them as a client so this is definitely one that is can be a little bit more tricky to do because it's not as automated it's just importing a list to instantly and blasting out some emails but if you do have leads that are worthwhile and you've found someone that you really want to try to work over a longer time I mean you guys only need one or two clients in order to get started so it might even be worth your time focusing on a handful of really really ideal prospects that you're able to find and say look these guys will be perfect for my business and perfect for my solution I'm going to really focus on just working in these five and hitting them from different angles until I can get their attention so again multi-channel prospecting is a huge thing and as you look to scale and build out an actual sales team this is going to be something you're doing more and more often so guys that's about it for sales processes and planning your customer Journey now this is absolutely crucial that you do this process before you start doing your Outreach because if you write an entire email campaign and starts going out but you haven't actually thought very very carefully about what you're trying to get out of that email campaign or out of those DMS then it's not going to sort of cohesively Link into your your entire sales process so get out your notebook or go onto figma and start to plan this out and say step one I'm contacting them I'm doing cold Outreach what am I trying to do in this first step what is the objective of this message okay it's to get a reply okay now that I've got a reply what am I trying to do here I'm going to send them more info in the form of a demo or a loom or something and then I'm going to send them the booking link so the objective here is to get a call booked in and provide more information on what we do get them excited really and then once you have them on the call what is the objective of the first call you might even be going for a one call close again if you're offering a services for free to begin with maybe you can get away with the one called close it's totally possible but then if you want to book in the second one it's just being clear and very purposeful about what you are doing at each stage so that you don't end up like the people in my community saying hey I've just booked in three course but I have no idea what I'm doing on them and I don't know what the objective is of any of this so I wanted to keep it short and sweet today but that is a very very important step for many of you I really urge you to do the exact same process I've just outlined here and avoid those four mistakes and of course if you aren't already subscribed to the channel

about how you want to solve that problem and getting very good at productizing that solution there's there's a fortune to be made um obviously Alex a huge thank you to you for everything you're doing in the space I think um first and foremost this has been something that at Real Results is something that I use every day and it's something that features on the channel and everything we do so I know you get it all the time and it must get a little bit tiring but of course a huge thank you to you and everything you're doing I mean for us to be able to support you in any way and get you some uh some leads for your book and for the event was uh was more than more than our pleasure so firstly just a huge thank you to you and everything you're doing as a role model in space all right so uh first thing we can jump into is probably just a little bit of background in terms of our community and what we're doing and then the kind of stuff that we end up going to do so that you can have a lot of more context and be able to be able to help us help us figure out what we're doing a little bit better all right rock and roll right I'll try to speed through this I don't want to make make this delete so uh I want to get through it so we can get to the value in the community question as soon as possible but essentially uh this community that we've built and sort of my channel and everything that we're doing is about how to create AI businesses as easily as possible and making it beginner friendly and sort of accessible to people who are aspiring entrepreneurs so going back to sort of where this all started I was a sort of marketer myself Josh sorry introductions Josh is my mentor and our business partner um we've been doing business for the past couple of years together and we started off doing marketing e-commerce and things like that and I saw an opportunity to diversify my skill sets away from Strictly marketing to more development and it's a novel quote which I'm sure you're familiar with the whole build and sell thing you become Unstoppable and I sort of trained myself up as a developer and was fortunate enough to be well positioned at the start of this AI thing to be able to really take advantage of it started the personal brand and saw like if we can build an audience here and build really a chance to really create a great product and have the distribution networks and things like that then we're going to be in a very good position so we're fortunate enough to stumble our way through the YouTube thing eventually get to nearly 100K now in the past eight nine months and through that we've been able to build a development company AI development company and it was through that we're able to really discover what we're now teaching to all of the people in the community which is how to create what we've called an AI automation agency now this is our framework for building an AI business and this is sort of a long way and a far cry from what these original AI businesses were once upon a time as I'm sure when you're putting out your content as well earlier in the sort of AI wave the the AI businesses people were recommending were not really businesses there were little glitches in the in the space-time fabric when a new technology comes out you can Arbitrage this new thing to copyright and stuff like that but as me as someone who's making this AI business entrepreneurship Channel I was thinking where is the actual opportunity for these entrepreneurs to be able to build the real businesses that's not a gimmick that's not based off some little glitch that's happening for a little bit of a few months or a few months at a time so that led us to creating potentially an AI development company and through that we had a lot of leads coming in that we weren't servicing and eventually we realized instead of having to custom code all of these solutions for these businesses we could actually use low Code and low code tools to be able to service them for basically a third of the price so instead of charging them ten thousand dollars we could say look we'll do it for the Loco tool but for three thousand dollars into our surprise they were actually pretty receptive of it and they were more than happy to actually get the AI integration and be able to benefit from this technology without having to pay the ridiculous price tag so with that kind of realization about five five months ago we realized holy holy crap we're sitting on something yeah that makes AI business and essentially allowing entrepreneurs to facilitate the adoption of AI technology and to smaller medium businesses that's kind of the whole philosophy of what we've built here we've given a framework to building a real interesting let me just ask a couple questions so when you see the EA agency is it like what type of agency is it simply like I look at your business and I think where could AI fit in and like how can it add value is it more like from that perspective or is it like a very specific you like is it content based or you know what I'm saying like is it just like how's the approach what's the end value that's being created or is it different with every single business yeah so that's that's the sort of beauty of it being too General and just saying Hey will aiify your business is not it's not a compelling offer and going back to what you say and all in all of your work as well the method that we've tried to really focus on it's something that I'm actually doing a case study to really go back to the the same place that everyone in the community is already at is walking through this step-by-step strategy that we've kind of put together and at least our current philosophy of picking one Niche and one specific deliverable and being able to focus on that and make when you when you be using software as I don't need to tell you but you can the replicability is really the value there so if you can create a system and build it once and be able to essentially just modify it in order to adapt it to that business then you have an opportunity to really scale that a bit more gracefully and we found with our own AI development company by doing custom things and having to change it every time there's no there's no scale in that result just to bring it back to to helping the community and particularly the sort of stuff that we are seeing on a day-to-day the big topic I want to address is how to sell emerging Tech it is a I know there's a lot of rules that come down to how you teach in your books it's selling the plain flavor versus the vacation that's all it is like if I if I could tell you that your financials would be absolutely accurate and updated in real time would you want that cool specific like how much would you be willing to pay compared to what you currently pay a lot more great what if I said I could do it for less than what you're currently paying are you interested great this is what I need the fact that I'm using AI is a relevant yeah so you just sell the outcome and then you not really compared like AI like AI is great for YouTube clickbait but for for sales it's irrelevant yeah yeah and I think I think it sounds complicated yeah I think it's anything new and like that that's unproven sounds anything that's going to scare them away right so well that was that was that was like one of the main wanted to get across um [Laughter] charge through all the questions like that um okay jumping through wait you must be getting a ton of businesses and and potentially some a lot of AI businesses that are coming across your desk right now at acquisition.com one of the things that's making of sort of jumping out at you and what are the sort of commonalities between things that make you really go well that that seems to have some kind of staying power uh the vast majority of our VA businesses that I look at are dog um and so they're either they're not real AI which is 99 of them um they're basically just built on chat CPT which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but I'm just like let's not claim that we're creating agents right yeah um on the other hand it's it's people who have no business Acumen and so they're like it's totally different like the normal loss of business don't apply it's like they have always looked like and they will always apply because they're just how business works right um and so like those are the vast majority people that I see in that in that that way I did make a tweet about the opportunity that you're talking about right now because I do think that AI implementation for Main Street is an enormous opportunity so aifying if you will and I I don't think I think your first conclusion is Right which is being the custom guy is tough you know I mean it's just it's all things to all people which is nothing to know on um um and so getting the audience really like so if I'm if I'm talking to the audience now if you guys want to get into this world what you want to do is look at an industry or an avatar that you understand well and so one of the things that like Y combinator and some of these great like you know legendary investors look at is how much time a Founder has suffered and lived through a problem right like I can talk about breathing because I've had two nose surgeries I've been falling asleep on my hand since I was in eighth grade so that I could breathe so like I've lived with the problem for a long time and I've tried many different types of solutions so I have tons of Industry knowledge if I were to start a company like that right and so you probably at some point worked in a business if you have a job right now or have had any type of job you've worked in a business that's a great Baseline of background knowledge that's difficult to just jump like if even if you were a server at a restaurant for two years you still would probably know more about restaurants than 99 of people who aren't in the restaurant industry like I don't know anything about how restaurants work because I've just never really worked in one right but you could probably be aware of because you now also have this understanding of what AI can do to think okay there's a hundred problems in a restaurant is there one very specific problem that I can solve well and it's very similar between restaurants because as soon as you get the point A to point B you can create the clear value prop and you can message around that and so like getting extremely specific which is I think what you were saying that you give the advice to is super smart and it makes the problem set really narrow to solve so you can become an expert that's a an inch wide the exact same thing if the audience you should actually have to do that right and the problem the reason that most people don't do that when they're starting out is because you don't have enough demand and so you just get you have so few leads that come to you that you're like well I mean I need to pay rent this month and I only got four leads this month and all four are completely different but I need the money and so I get it sometimes you have to be a little bit inefficient in the beginning so that you can get cash flow going but the idea would be to redeploy like redeploy that cash into getting really concentrated on your marketing which is what offers and leads is all about so that you can find that specific Avatar that you can over and over again repeat which is also why referrals are so strong because if you do a good job they will send you other people just like them yeah I think this brings us to an important one that I've and part of the this business model that we've really been trying to deconstruct and figure out the best way which is getting that that market specific goal at that specific knowledge within industry because the the question is is yes I can pick a niche to do this AI automation I can build AI Solutions and a sort of targeted one but what is the opportunity that I should Target within the niche and that comes down to either a as you said industry experience that you already have or sort of be what we've said is finding some sort of partner within the industry so in terms of finding a partner and these these specific knowledge do you have any any tips on how people could do that and what's the most efficient way that you've seen it it really just comes down to how to have a normal Business Partnership so all the normal rules of business apply and this person has some specific knowledge you don't have and you should ideally have specific knowledge they don't have because they would they should be asking the question like why do I partner with the people in your community if I'm an AI developer right like why why should I use why don't I just learn that stuff and then I can own the whole thing so that that's similar to what you say about regarding SAS and software companies is that you need to have that person with the specific knowledge or in case of SAS their technical partner who's sole thing is just improved product right so um I want to quickly before before we run out of time I want to make sure Isaiah gets this question because he's the guy who made this all happen so I say if you want to jump in and that's it brother um yeah real quick if you're trying to figure out which of the problems to solve in an industry it's just value created times ease of implementation and so like that's the equation which if you chunk it up it's number of potential customers times gross profit per customer the ease part is just you know operational drag associated with with the solution so that's how I would think through if I have six different problems I could potentially solve which one has way more people who have it which one's easier to do which one unlocks the most value okay we'll make we'll make a whole bunch of Workshop Resources with this for the community Isaiah shoot yes sir Alex yeah first of all I just want to say I've taken a lot away from just like your application a language and like the way that you were so specifically uh you're so concise with the way that you communicate and as a master NLP practitioner I've like learned to model your like style and so one of the things that I asked um Liam was hey where do you think from the perspective of Alex's three Frameworks the offer the leads and supposedly the money model from your website I don't know what the third book is um could you share your could you share your insights on where the AI automation model itself might Excel or falter like where does clarity need to be established first for it to be successful long term it has to work like that's the biggest thing like all the stuff that you guys probably are learning or know about marketing and advertising only accelerates the awareness that you bring to the product and so if the product sucks everyone will just find out quickly and then you'll have to create a new product which is why so many of these info guys just keep launching new things because they're really good at marketing and really shitty at product and so they have to keep making new products making more promises and then burning more bridges and that's literally the model uh which is horrible and a shitty way to live and so it makes more sense to figure out like that's why like the more narrow the problem that you're defining the easier it is to do it well and so like it's not just like it feels like it's making your life harder but it's really picking where you want it to be hard so like if you're a generalist it's really easy in the beginning really hard to scale if you're really narrow in the beginning it makes it a little bit harder in the beginning but then really easy to scale and so it's just picking where you want your pain um like a generalist is going to have tons of operational drag very people heavy the the the narrow or the niche audience is going to have a harder time on demand gen but the margins are going to be better and it'll scale better will be dependent on the solution that's being provided so like you'll have leads issues if you're super narrow you'll have delivery issues if you're super wide in terms of like where's the constraint and so it's really just balancing those different variables so that you can create the most throughput in the business but all of those are dependent on the one big thing which is like can you keep the promise that you're making to the prospect if you do it well like if you actually like the problem I said if you could just actually automate the collection of membership dues for gym or for any you know whatever using AI everyone would sign up for it it's just how well do you solve that promise and how painful using the value equation how painful do you make it for a business to actually get it implemented nice awesome okay um there's there's one thing I wanted to run through here quickly as well uh one thing that we're starting to see as as us ourselves actually trying to build one of these these AI automation agencies no air development company as well is that we've always uh looking at it as a as an agency model compared to other agency models we're starting to see the sort of hidden benefit that that we're really starting to see coming to come into play in our own business that is that by building a development team that is capable uh particularly in AI which is very very handy at this at this time at this day and age um is having at least from your experience how crucial is building up some kind of development resources behind you especially as using particularly the agency model as is not particularly the highest leverage one right it's not the it's not an stf business model as you always talk about leverage uh in terms of using an agency model as a vehicle to go from sort of broke and unskilled and resource poor to a point where you are able to sort of springboard onto bigger opportunities so what in the in the sort of Realm of SAS and things like this so what is is your take and your experience with how important that development resource is I mean assured your event in last note working with developers can be a complete plan but having them in-house and having a really good team to rely on as you shoot for those big opportunities can be key once you're experience being like this and how important do you think that development resources when you're going for those bigger plays very if you're in a service business the quality of the people that you use to provide the service is the product and so those people usually want to be compensated well because if they are really good then the places that they're coming from will want to pay more to keep them and so you have to give them a great place to work and a financial incentive or some upside that they get exposed to that they wouldn't otherwise like you want them to feel like owners and the best way to do that is for them to actually be owners now if you want to build a massive team they might just be like you have to go find like you have to go find the biggest baddest you know engineer that you can and then that person gets upside and then that person uses their influence to bring you know the people in their Network underneath of them but like if you were in a if you're trying to get on The Cutting Edge of Technology then actually having the people who are good at that is the business yeah okay well that's good because that's one of the things that I'm really excited for people who are jumping in and creating this not only is it like a an easy accessible Point like smma or any kind of agency model to get started but the smma thing it runs to a certain point but that that marketing resource it doesn't necessarily give you well it is a great resource to have a really killer marketing tape under your belt but the development side of things I tend to find at least in our experience has been a harder thing for us to to create because we don't know it yeah I guess so yeah it's hard you're paying down ignorance tax like it's easier for you to do the marketing stuff because you're good at it so you know if someone's full of on the internet you just don't know if anyone's full of on the interview because you have no context yeah so the heart so the heart the most important higher which is why I say this is you need a technical co-founder you need somebody who has a real stake in making sure that the people are coming in are actually good not that you're checking a box and saying hey I have 14 people on my development team because anybody in the in the true high-tech world knows that one amazing developer is more available than 100 B developers but with that level developer also doesn't come cheap because the opportunity cost for them is significantly higher and they would want to partner with somebody who has experience growing something big who's who can fill their deficit now they also don't have contacts on what you have so you could be full of right I'm not saying you are but I'm just saying like from their perspective right and so going into that I think with an engineering type of person showing as much evidence in data because that's how most of them kind of think will help make a case that is more relatable to them and uh from your perspective that's like this is the hardest part of business is hiring people who are really good at something without knowing the in-depth knowledge and that's where like leveraging somebody who might not want to work for you that you do think is brilliant to at least interview or double check on how good they are um is really valuable that's where like building a network becomes important um and and getting even some tests like of aptitude for them to take so that you can at least get some sort of Baseline but it's all going to be about how skilled that person is because ideally if they were as good as you are at marketing then you guys would probably have a really successful business we've been fortunate enough to to find that find that magical sort of technical co-founder so um we're starting to get them really well compensated both getting an APD as well so we are off to the race and that's completely changed our business I can't even trust for anyone of you in here that that key hire is just a complete game I'm sure you've had it Alex in your businesses where you've just found that right person and it just completely changes things so I think we are tied on time here so I wanted to jump into a little bit uh of a more sort of General entrepreneurship question not necessarily specific to this but uh one thing that myself and Josh and our team I really wanted to get your take on this but as an unfort as a group of entrepreneurs myself and Josh and our team and all our friends who grew up with who we're fortunate enough to work with at the moment uh we've always wondered uh we sometimes have sort of a six hours or a day where we actually get to unwind and and click off for a bit and the amount of ideas and sort of new things that we discover on those times that we're actually Switched Off are so hugely valuable we've always wondered what if we actually just schedule this and how how much further ahead or behind would we be in terms of that lost work versus the the ideas and the the relaxed attention so I want to know what how do you incorporate relaxed or is it to relax attention relax attention into your life as an entrepreneur and how important does uh that play a role in terms of you being able to come up with new ideas how do you actually bait that into your life and where do you get your ideas I just I try to minimize the amount of meetings that I'm on that's that's me but like every every role in a company is different like an operator it's tip you know creating lots of new ideas is usually not the operators primary function like they're making sure that things are operating efficiently not going on time and driving objectives um if you're the Creator founder Visionary strategic thinker whatever it is your title then having more time to hop on phone calls with people that are that can give you information around you know a specific thing that you're thinking on like bouncing bouncing ideas off stuff um becomes more valuable and so now mind you that's not like Social Hour but like having targeted conversations where you're just getting as much information as you can uh can be valuable for me I have just run my schedule the same way for a while now which is just I don't have anything like today is an exception because my whole day is these um but most of the time I don't have anything until one o'clock um and so I take meetings and like one is when they're allowed to start but even then my team starts booking them back to front so you know the my last meeting might end at 5 30 and so it's a 30 minute meeting the next meeting will be at 4 30 that ends at five and so they book from back to front so that um so that I have as much free time as I possibly can that's because I don't need motivation to work like I'll work all the hours today anyways um and if the more free time I have the better ideas I come up with okay right I think that's uh I think that's a wrap Alex it's been an absolute pleasure thank you so much for everything you do um like we all appreciate it so much good luck with the rest of these calls and uh and congratulations on the book launch no I appreciate it let me just say a special thanks to the community um thank you guys so much for for showing up it means a ton to me more than I can really say um and I wish I could have this call with every single person uh physics the laws of physics don't allow it and so hopefully this is you know one small step in that direction um if you are starting one of these businesses I think it is a good opportunity just the the idea of helping businesses Implement AI into their business and being very specific and focused about how you want to solve that problem and getting very good at productizing that solution um there is there's a fortune to be made in just making businesses more efficient and so uh I would also not communicate it using techno jargon uh with the person that you're ultimately trying to sell just tell them what life's going to be like once this thing is done and ask them if they want that sell the transformation and avoid the mechanism yeah all right appreciate you guys thank you guys for showing up hopefully the book serves you guys well [Music]"

              "text": "hey guys welcome back to the channel my name is Liam and in this video I wanted to share with you my journey as an AI entrepreneur from 0 to 160 000 per month in just eight months I'll walk you through my experience in 2023 alone where I started the year with zero subscribers minimal experience with AI models and most importantly zero dollars in AI related income it's been about eight months since I went all in on building AI businesses and the road it hasn't always been easy in fact it's probably been the most difficult chapter in my entire entrepreneurial Journey so I genuinely wanted to come on here and share my struggles because I know many of you may be facing similar challenges maybe you want to take advantage of this new and exciting technology but don't know where to start or you've tried to start your own AI business already but you've had a dead end if this sounds like you I hope this video can serve as an inspiration of where you can go with the right information strategy and commitment I'll also share some valuable tips and tricks on what helped boost my AI income and at the end of the video I'm going to share with you my plan to scale to 1 million dollars per month in 2024. a bit about me I'm currently 23 years old I've been doing online business for about five years now I'm from Little New Zealand but I'm now based in Dubai and I was at University for a little while but I eventually dropped out in order to go and pursue my dream of building an online business and in the process giving up tens of thousands of dollars of scholarships to State University when I first started my online business journey I was doing e-commerce and Drop Shipping as many of you probably were as well and then I was able to transition that into working with my business partner on his marketing agency and then around two years ago I decided to teach myself to code again and from there I started playing around with language models around the end of 2022. little did I know that my entire entrepreneurial Journey up until then had been preparing me to be perfectly positioned to take advantage of the AI boom and I remember when I first saw Chad GPT and played around with it I instantly knew that I had to go all in on this new technology I'd seen friends of mine do very well by writing these technological Trends in order to create their own personal brand and so I figured this was my opportunity to throw my hat in the ring and start my career and journey as a YouTuber I was of course absolutely horrible at the beginning of making videos you can even scroll back and see some of my old ones but I'm happy to say that I'm pretty sure that I've improved quite a lot since then initially my plan for the channel was to combine my passion for entrepreneurship with this new technology and really create an AI business channel to teach people and help people to make money with AI it actually did end up getting a little bit sidetracked and started doing like AI development tutorials on the channel but that actually ended up playing a crucial role in my long-term success as you'll see and to be fully transparent I didn't have a super clear strategy on exactly how I would end up making 160 000 per month before the end of the year but I was doing what entrepreneurs do best I was throwing myself off the cliff and backing myself to to build the plane before I hit the ground which brings me to my first tip for those of you wanting to get started as an AI entrepreneur start a personal brand and document your growth the reason why is that this space is so new you have a chance right now to establish yourself as a thought leader and an OG in the space and in five ten years if you're consistent you'll be one of the big dogs in the center of one of the biggest industry trees in the world even in my short run as a public figure I've been able to put myself in the center of an emerging and new and exciting industry and with that comes many benefits like infinite leads for your business and the attention of people you used to watch on YouTube while you were eating two minute noodles start sharing your journey do cool stuff and people will come plus if you're able to make content that connects and engages with people then that's an extremely valuable skill to build now going back to the story it was from the AI development tutorials as I mentioned before that I was actually able to start generating my first few dollars of AI related income and this came in the form of my Consulting course these were initially 150 for 45 minutes and they were a super easy way for me to monetize my channel initially now I can do these calls in my sleep but when I first started I was absolutely terrified my knowledge was only good in a few areas but thankfully it was improving rapidly just by the amount of reps and and exposure that I was getting from the work I was doing as I continued to be consistent on YouTube I started getting so many of these calls booked in that I had to increase my price and I had to do this multiple times to the point where now I'm doing 45 minutes for a thousand dollars and I can only allow four of them to be booked per week and I still get two of them booked per week so it's from 150 to 45 minutes all the way up to one thousand dollars for 45 minutes in the space of a couple of months aside from earning me my first dollars in AI income these Consulting courts actually lit the path to the next chapter in my journey which was starting an AI development company now on these calls I had so many people practically begging me to help them build their AI projects that the only logical Next Step was to hire a developer and get him to basically build these builds for me and I could just do a little bit of sort of high level analysis and say look this is what you need to do now you go away and build it now in theory this sounds great and simple but the reality was quite the opposite I quickly realized that trying to build a low maintenance development company focused around emerging technology was like trying to herd cats and so it began the long and difficult journey of building an AI development company and my company as many of you may know is called Morningside Ai and this is named after this suburb that I grew up in New Zealand in February of 2023 just one month after starting my channel the Consulting course and Lead flow were continually increasing to the point where I was struggling to maintain both my YouTube channel and the day-to-day operations of Morningside so needing help I reached out to my mentor Josh and asked if you wanted to come on and partner with me in the business and be my head of operations this was a key inflection point for our company as by dividing the labor I was able to continue to focus and really put the Hammer Down on YouTube as Josh was able to focus on the day-to-day operations and sort of pick up more and more of the sales calls and also direct the hiring of new new Developers for us which was hugely important for us as we scaled which brings me to my second tip for those wanting to do similar things to me find a business partner or business partners that complement your set of skills we've been friends for four years and trust each other completely which is absolutely vital so as you go on your journey keep an eye out for others that you meet who share your vision and your values and when the time is right join forces with them and watch the competition fall away fast forward to May 2023 Josh and I were in the pits of growing pains for our new company I was in Colombia going through a breakup Josh was in Spain with the rest of our team and we had low quality Talent working for us that was causing a lot of issues on projects and we also had a surprisingly low close rate on all of the leads that were coming through despite the sheer volume we were getting from the channel it was tough but it was under the pressure of these tough times that a diamond was formed by this point we had actually started to ignore a lot of the leads that were coming through because they were too small and the amount of admin and hassle involved which is not worth our time so anything below ten thousand dollars we were basically ignoring until one day I stumbled across no code bot Builders and really started to explore them and I quickly realized that we could build a lot of these low ticket projects within a couple of days with these no code bot Builders custom knowledge chat Bots were the most common request so sensing an opportunity I dug out some of our old leads and started testing Service delivery for these clients using these platforms and to my surprise the clients were completely unbothered they were completely fine with us using these no code platforms and they were more so happy that we they didn't have to pay the ten thousand dollars that we quoted them for a custom coded version of it and with this the AI automation agency model was born we immediately contacted all of our stale leads and pitched them the same build but at one third of the price we had originally quoted them and suddenly our income from these low Code and low code builds was nearly equaling that on our custom development side at Morningside which really surprised us as these lower code ones were typically easier to deliver and so may 2023 was another key inflection point for my personal income growth and also for the growth of our company which brings me to my next tip for you all which is that in order to make any kind of Discovery and really unlock new income opportunities for yourself you need to be working at the bleeding edge of an industry it is literally impossible to do so from the sidelines if you've been watching my videos you'll know that I talk so highly about the AI automation agency model because it allows you to get into the AI industry and start actually participating rather than just spectating people tend to over complicate it but at the end of the day it is simply a framework for creating an AI business that gives you the perfect on-ramp into the world of AI entrepreneurship now at the time of discovering the AI automation agency model my channel was just a place for me to share what I was learning in the AI world so I quickly put out a video and shared what we discovered and the opportunity that we had really found little do they know what would come next before I knew it everyone and their dog was raving about the model we'd created AI automation agency EI automation meetings with your AI automation agency or AI automation agencies AI Automation and with that came a surge of interest that still blows my mind to this day YouTube search volume for the keyword AI automation agency nearly equaled that of artificial intelligence and the keyword exploded on Google Trends too all from zero just a few months prior we had obviously created something that resonated with millions of people everyone wanted to start an AI business us but we were the first ones to ditch the gimmicks and give them a real plan and a real framework on how to do so then we backed up the opportunity with historical examples to cut through the hype and lay out the opportunity clear as day while all of this was happening I continued to put out content on the topic consistently sharing my experiences As I Grew my own AI automation agency and sharing step-by-step guides on how others could start their own My Views and my subscribers exploded which brings me to my next tip if you want to grow rapidly on YouTube you need to find a starving crowd I identified that people desperately wanted to make money with AI and gave them a blueprint on how they can create their own profitable and scalable AI business not some chat GPT based hustle now of course finding a starving crowd is not easy but I would say growing at a snail's pace in a dead Niche is far harder with My Views exploding I wanted to capture some of that attention somewhere so I created a free Discord community and started hosting free weekly workshops where I'd go through some something that I was doing within my own agency and sort of sharing my techniques and my learnings and I'd also do weekly q and A's once a week for free then it was time to just do the work and after three months of grinding on YouTube and my free community and on Morningside client work my team had exploded in size and had attracted some of the best talent in the world my YouTube channel had exploded to 80 000 subscribers and in my free community and my newsletter had also grown to around 30 000 members each when I started YouTube I swore I would never become a core selling Guru but at this point there was a real need for me to be able to amplify really magnify my ability to teach people this meant hiring specialist coaches to help my community members one-on-one at every stage of building the AI automation agency or Triple A as we call it this also meant increasing the workshop frequency from one to three times per week and creating an AI version of myself to allow unlimited access to my knowledge and my methods for starting a triple A we called this product my Triple A accelerator there's designed to be a Swiss army knife of resources to help you accelerate your AAA success the launch of my AAA accelerator was an enormous success with our Premium plan being now sold out at least for the next few months and all of our targets being hit on our standard plan we are now generating around sixty thousand dollars per month from this a large portion of which is being reinvested into hiring the best coaches we can find building the best tools and providing the best resources for our community members which brings me to my next tip ignore the noise people on the internet are more fragile than ever and people nowadays expect everything to be given to them for free and happen in an instant if you have a chance to magnify your ability to teach and help people then do it let the credit cards of those in your audience decide not the chatter of keyboard Warriors I'm now able to teach far more people at a far higher level of Education than I ever was before and that brings us up to right now September 2023 me and my team are on track to do one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars and profit for this month and that's all from AI businesses that didn't exist at the start of the year but we are only just getting started next year I plan to scale my AI income to one million dollars per month I will do this by building my own SAS platform that leverages AI technology however building a successful SAS is only possible because of my success as a triple A owner building my AAA has created the perfect launch pad for me and my team into SAS mainly because of the following three factors firstly information and experience I have a near infinite supply of incredible AI SAS ideas my business partner and I are constantly adding new ones to our already bloated lists and this is just part of what happens when you work in the industry day in day out your exposure to new and exciting opportunities is constant this stream of information combined with my experience makes the real opportunities in the space glaringly obvious secondly cash flow I have the cash flow from my AI automation agency required in order to bankroll myself which allows us to retain close to 100 ownership for me and my team meaning we don't need any VCS or outside Capital at all and thirdly and most importantly development resources I have a world-class AI development team at my disposal in order to build state-of-the-art AI products plus because they are my full-time employees I'll be paying cost price to build out any of my AI SAS ideas having an elite Dev team is the ultimate hidden benefit to building a successful AI automation agency it is a ludicrous Edge to have in this day and age for those wanting the big exits the million dollar months which brings me to my final tip if you are going to start an online business pick one that sets you up to springboard onto bigger opportunities your agency is not the end goal it is simply a vehicle to take you from broke and unskilled and resource poor to being someone who is ready and capable of building an eight or nine figure business but you need to create the successful agency first so that sums up the past eight and a half months for me I want to be completely clear that this kind of success does not happen overnight and I was only able to do what I've done because of the past four years of groundwork that I did to prepare myself for this building valuable skills building long-term relationships creating good habits and growing my knowledge I hope that my story can Inspire some of you to start that process today start your business become a player not a spectator I'll leave you all with a quote that helped me through some of my toughest times as an inspiring entrepreneur that I used to say to myself every morning out loud in order to remind me that life is a marathon not a Sprint I'm exactly where I need to be to learn what I need to learn in order to become the person I want to be thanks for watching"

              "text": "I started a brand new AI automation agency two weeks ago and I've just closed my first three clients in under two days with only four sales calls needed this is episode two of an ongoing Series where I start and scale and AI automation agency from zero to ten thousand dollars in Revenue in the space of 30 days and if I fail after PayPal one thousand dollars to someone who comments under one of the videos in the series in this video I'm going to be walking you through the exact scripts systems and strategies that I use to sign my first three clients and at the end of the video I'm going to be sharing with you the top three things that I wish I knew before I started now just to be clear I have basically zero experience doing cold Outreach and I've never sold a product like this before so this is a completely new experience for me so if you want to start and scale your own AI automation agency and want to see me walk a mile in your shoes and go through the same challenges and struggles then this is a video for you of course if you haven't already watched episode one where I did my Niche selection my offer creation and building my landing page that's going to be available up here for you to watch first but here's a quick reminder of the terms of this challenge firstly the agent that I create must be completely separate from my own AI automation agency and development company called Morningside AI secondly I must build everything myself using no code or low code tools I can't use my own development team to get things done and finally I cannot use any kind of paid advertising to get my clients now if you watched the last episode you would have seen that I was just arriving here in Thailand I've now been here for a few weeks I've been working on this project quite a lot during that time so the first thing I did when I arrived here was start building a marketing plan for how I'm actually going to sell and Market my services I started this marketing plan by listing out all the different lead generation methods that I could think of so Facebook groups LinkedIn groups using Google Maps search scraping Instagram Etc so I put them all on the list and then I did the same for outreach methods so if I got all of those leads from those different sources how could I actually contact them so I have email you have Instagram DMS you have cold calling Etc so I wrote all of these out and then I started to sort of pair them up so I paired up a lead generation method with a Outreach method and I made that one of my sort of angles that I was going to take and one of the strategies and systems that I wanted to set up so I boiled all these options down to what I've called the four pillars of my acquisition strategy for this particular project which were as follows firstly a LinkedIn outbound automation system secondly Instagram follower scraping too cold email thirdly Instagram called DMS and finally cold calling now because I was just getting started with this I didn't know what was going to work best so I decided to take a shotgun approach and say I'm going to try multiple different things and see which works best but I knew that given these four different options if I did enough volume of all of them then there's no way that I could fail so as mozzie says volume negates luck and that was the same approach I was having a look if I do all four of these things in enough volume there's no way that I don't at least get one or two clients to get started now I'm going to show you how I set up each of my four pillars then I'm going to show you the results I got for them and then share a little bit of reflection on each of them what I thought about it and what I maybe could have done better on each of them firstly my automated LinkedIn outbound system I did this using a platform called dropify which I have mentioned before it's basically a platform where you're able to run campaigns and sort of do email campaigns essentially about on LinkedIn you can set up custom campaigns where you can connect with people you can view their profile you can send a message and then send follow-up messages after that so it's like like a email platform but full LinkedIn which is very very powerful Now using a platform like jobify is what of the things that I got set up first because it does take a while to pick up speed there is a limit on the number of vesters you can send out but the idea is that I wanted to get this set up as soon as possible so that I can just leave it running the entire time that I'm doing the challenge and it could be building up connections because I'm connecting with people on LinkedIn it's automatically connecting with people and then sending them out so there's multiple days between the messages sometimes so it's a long process it's one of those things that I really wanted to get set up at the start rather than leaving it later so in order to set up a dropify campaign first thing you need to do is go to LinkedIn sales Navigator so I signed up and got an account there then what I was able to do is filter using the LinkedIn sales Navigator down to people who are Fitness coaches they were personal trainers and I was able to filter by I think Ireland the UK Canada USA and the UAE as well so that was the sort of list and it was people who were in a business that was one to ten employees so they're either self-employed or they had a company that was under 10 people then you can take the link from the LinkedIn sales Navigator take that directly over to tripify and then create a lead list out of that so I got my lead list I put it into Japan I started loading the leads and then I created a campaign in order to firstly connect with people and then also send a couple of messages selling and sort of pitching my services so I'm going to put the campaign up here on screen I kind of have to go through this quickly to get a little into this video but you guys can pause it and look at the messages I got set up here and set up the same campaign that you want to run with the same sort of format so with that campaign set up I left it to do its thing and that was my pillar one complete number two IG scraping to cold email I knew that my target market of online fitness coaches and personal trainers were very very active typically on Instagram they post content about their services Etc and they do a lot of selling through their Instagram it's really like the main Hub of their business all I needed to build a nice big lead list was to be able to find lots of these accounts quickly and efficiently and then be able to scrape all of the information including their phone number and email where possible I quickly realized that Instagram search was not going to cut it for this so I quickly switched over and tried to find some kind of Instagram influencer search platform and I found one called modash I'm not affiliated with them in any way it's just a tool that I found I ended up getting a free trial there for seven days or something hop on on there and I was able to search up things like for online fitness coach personal trainer and the keywords I was able to filter by the industry to health and fitness health and wellness and then thankfully the first results that came up in this this influencer search was a guy called will geroni and when I clicked on his profile he had about 140 000 followers and then 2 500 people that he was following but the key bit about finding this account was that I saw in his bio that I help online fitness coaches make more money or I help people scale their online fitness coaching business which to me was a jackpot because that meant that this guy was someone who's teaching my target market the people that I want to speak to and sell to he is teaching them so all of the people that he's following would be having a very very high likelihood of being the exact kind of people that I'm looking for so I've kind of figured out this this little opportunity for me where I have 2 500 potential clients there wanting to do was scrape all that information and then be able to pick through the mess and find the ones that are actually the people that I want to talk to so in terms of Instagram this is a very very uh targeted way of doing it and I was very fortunate enough to find one of these kind of of accounts and I ended up finding a bunch more like this as I went on so that might be a tip for you if you are doing this and you're looking to do IG Legion if you can find someone who teaches your target market then they're going to be following a lot of the people either past clients or potential clients that they're talking to and they're going to have their following filled with the kind of people that you want to reach out to now with this profile that I saw as my golden ticket to get in my first few clients I was able to take it and put it into an Instagram scraping tool I set it to scrape all of his following so about 2 500 people that he was actually following himself I was using a tool that is no longer working so if you want to do the same thing I would just do a Google search of IG scraping Chrome extensions and things like that there's usually new ones popping up all the time so find one of those tools and I was able to put it in there and scrape all of the information from his following and I was able to get important information like their name their username their Instagram bio which is very very important for the latest steps I'm going to talk to you about and then also get their email and phone number when it was available on their profile so now that I have my list of 2500 potential clients I was going to be able to use this in three different ways firstly see I could use the accounts that came with an email I could use it for my outbound called email using instantly secondly I could just DM all of the different accounts that I've scraped on Instagram do cold DMS trying to purchase them my services and then when the phone number was present on the account I could then take a list of just the phone numbers and then start cold calling them as well so this list was a very very big and key play for me because it was going to help three different ways without reaching to them basically this list was my ticket to the promised land of 10K in Revenue but there's one issue while on my list did have a very high concentration of people who were online fitness coaches and online personal trainers which are my target market there of course was still some fluff mixed in no one follows just one kind of person so obviously when I scrape the following of this guy I did get some celebrities I did get some Sportsmen Etc I needed to find a way to dig through all of these 2500 people and get rid of the ones who didn't match the people that I was trying to sell to now there are two ways I could do this of course one is manually and I could just go through and check all these Instagram profiles and determine if they were the kind of person that I wanted to sell to or I could be smart about it and use AI to do it for me so I headed over to make.com and I created a new scenario where I was going to be looking up all of the different rows in the spreadsheet and I was going to use an AI task and make.com to analyze the information in the bio column of my spreadsheet so when I scraped the data I was able to scrape their bio as well which is had a ton of important information in it basically telling what they're selling or what the offer is they used a prompted AI task within make to analyze the bio and basically output on whether they were fit for my criteria or not so I just wrote a prompt saying I'm looking for online fitness coaches and personal trainers these are the kind of things that they may have in the bio can you please output a zero or a one into the column and then after I've done the whole sheet then I could just filter by the one and then I've now got just the people who fit my criteria I was even able to set up another AI task in the scenario to extract the first name property from the username and from the full name within the Instagram profile and that was able to create a new column of first name which I then used in my email campaigns later so when you're writing email campaigns you'll put a variable insane High first name and it's important to have that first name variable so I was able to extract the first name from the information on their profile I was also able to use their bio and other information to determine if they were the kind of people that I was trying to sell to now this particular automation is actually super useful in a bunch of different use cases so it's actually been given away as an exclusive template as part of the subscription for those who are in my AAA accelerator so if you're already in there you can get access to it in the template section of the Discord now that I had a list of about 2 000 people instead of 2500 I was then able to take that list and filter by all of those who had an email and that took me down to about 600 and then I was able to take that lead list and put it over into instantly and start creating a new campaign for my cold email now I am a complete Noob when it comes to cold email I've never really run campaigns before but what I am good at is copywriting so I was able to write some fairly decent sequences and I'll put them up on screen here for you guys to take notes from or just copy them word for word and change things around now I must admit that I didn't really know the best practices for cold email when I set these up we since have had the founder of instantly come into my AAA accelerator and do a cold email workshop on the basics as well the tips and tricks so there's a couple changes that I need to make to these uh going forward however this got me started which I'm sure you guys can take notes from now in terms of actually sending these emails out I only had two warmed up accounts in my instantly so this was limiting the number of emails that I could send to about 100 per day because each account can do about 50. so I was limited to 100 emails per day and with that campaign set up and running I could leave it to do its thing and that was my second pillar complete my third pillar was Instagram called dming this one was pretty straightforward because in the prior step as I just mentioned I already had a list of about 2 000 Instagram accounts because these didn't have to have an email these were just the Instagram profile URL so I was able to get about 2 000 of those and then it was just a case of going through and manually messaging them one by one you can use Instagram DM like automation platforms but I think they're very very strict on the limits that you can use and I don't want to get my personal Instagram banned so it wasn't worth it for me to use one of these sort of sketchy third-party platforms I'd rather just distort myself and make sure that I wasn't going to get banned so off my Instagram called dming I would just pull up the accounts I would open them up and send them a message and do about 10 to 15 per hour and just keep doing the cycle over and over and over again and that system was pillar 3 complete the fourth and final puller in my acquisition strategy for this challenge was cold calling first thing I needed to do was get a list of phone numbers that I could call so thankfully in the step before we also had a list of phone numbers from that scraped account list that I had so I was able to get I think 50 to 80 phone numbers from from the 2500 that I originally scraped so that was a good starting point I also went over to a platform called apollo.io which you may have heard of which is a great b2b's really generation and sort of Outreach platform so I went on there and I searched up Fitness coaches and personal trainers and I was able to filter leads by being a personal trainer having a small business Etc and then I got about three to four hundred phone numbers out from there one thing I want to mention about Apollo IO is that to get three to four hundred different phone numbers I think I had to pay like 97 or 197 dollars so it's quite expensive I don't know if I'd recommend paying the kind of prices for these numbers if you do the same process of what I did on Instagram just do it a few times over with different accounts you can easily get a more targeted list of leads list of phone numbers especially with my phone numbers from the Instagram scraping and from Apollo IO all put into a list together I now have my list to start cold calling with and that was my fourth pillar setup and ready to go with my four pillars set up it was really now just time to do the work and just continue to do the Reps let these campaigns do their thing wait for the replies to come back try to book and calls and of course for me doing these cold calls and doing the Instagram DM Outreach every hour just sort of grinding away and sending these messages as many times as I can during the day so there was a lot of grinding that happened in the week that followed so I'm going to give you actually a little bit of a sneak peek of what a day looked like for me here when I was working on it so I'll cut to that now all right so they have a day in the life of this Challenge video we have a lot of work to do going to be doing some booking and calls we've got to check my Outreach and push some more Instagram DMS out we also have to do some cold calling tonight you guys are going to get to see um so yeah all the hands on deck at the moment and you're also going to get to see a little bit of the cool stuff we're doing here in Thailand which is going to be Muay Thai and I'm at a gym as well so we can get started on that now [Music] foreign [Music] so I'm in the process of doing some Outreach at the moment and identifying what's working and what's not it seems like Instagram is going to be the best place I'm getting responses from some but it seems like they're not really aware of the issue so I'm running into this over and over again that they don't actually realize there's an issue with not having some kind of autoresponder on the Instagram so I'm going to be setting a limit of 100 outbound DMS per day on Instagram also going to be doing form submissions so I've noticed that a lot of these personal trainers have their own forms which are these really clunky ways of onboarding customers so I'm going to actually go through and submit around 50 forms per day and hopefully that's going to get me into the door and actually get a few conversations started um but we're looking to close uh two or three Deals in the next two three days so uh we're definitely on track and I'm going to keep keep putting these numbers and then we should be good just finished up our morning work block with the team now we're going to go doing some Muay Thai at AKA Thailand doing like three times a week at the moment so it keeps us active keeps us the Mind sharp as well so you're going to see a couple clips of that now yeah yeah [Music] 901 Shelby Drive look alive look alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] now we can get into the results and I can show you the kind of numbers that I was doing on them the the response rates Etc and what actually moved the needle for me and in terms of getting these clients signed firstly we have my LinkedIn automation setup on dripify I let the campaign run for a little over a week and out of the hundreds of people that I've tried to connect with I was able to connect with 58 of them so 58 new connections of which 20 of them actually replied to one of my messages in the sequence that I was sending them and of those 20 replies only 10 of them were interested or positive but that actually resulted in zero calls being booked so while I was connecting with a ton of new people and actually having conversations none of those conversations actually resulted in a meeting getting booked now in hindsight I can kind of see why this didn't work as I expected uh firstly the the quality of leads and the people that I was actually contacting when I would see the responses coming in from them and within the dropify sort of messaging panel I would see that some of them weren't even the kind of person that I was looking for so I would get a negative reply and say hey sorry I'm not interested in this I would look at it and it would be a completely unrelated some guy be like a business manager so I think the quality of the lead list that I've imported from sales Navigator over to jobify wasn't the right kind of list and when I actually went back over to sales Navigator recently I changed the the list set up to be using keywords based around online fitness coaching and online personal training so the online part I was able to search on sales navigator for that keyword of online and because they are more specifically the kind of people that I want to work with so in hindsight I want to be more particular about the kind of list because connecting with all these people is great but if they're not the right kind of people they don't just waste my time in general while I didn't get good results in terms of calls booked from this specifically I still think that a LinkedIn automation setup like this is a key part of my acquisition strategy and I think for many of you out there as well just because of the nature of the platform and when you're going through one of these jobify setups you are connecting with them with a personal message and then you're able to talk to them in their inbox and it's a lot more natural and it's it's very very different to cold emails so I think just the dynamic of the platform and the way that you can send these messages it comes across very organic compared to cold email so for that reason alone going to continue to do this I've just updated the lead list that I'm running and I've kind of changed around the messages a little bit to use some different offers and have some different angles and just Test new things secondly we have the results from a cold email I'll put them up on screen here I contacted 210 different leads from that I got about 10 replies of which five were positive and off these five positive replies I was able to get two calls booked so looking back while I was able to get to Claus book which is great the big issue that's glaringly obvious is that I was only being able to send 100 emails per day so I only had two accounts warmed up as I mentioned this was seriously throttling the speed at which I was able to get responses and sort of move towards getting clients so if there's one thing that I could fix that I didn't do at the start is to get a ton of email accounts warming up as soon as possible because they take three weeks if I was starting this all over again the very very first thing I would have done or even before I started the challenge is to buy five or ten different domains on GoDaddy set them up as Google workspaces and then put those accounts into instantly to start warming up if you are starting an AI automation agency and you're about to jump into it the first thing you should be doing is buying at least a couple of domains and starting to warm up so that in three weeks time when you're ready to start smashing some cold email you will have them warmed up and ready because otherwise you you can't send anything and you'll be stuck like I am with basically no no volume to be able to send out some of the responses that I did get from this cold email campaign were actually very exciting I had some guy with one million followers it's called Christian flino that he replied and said he was interested and then I shot a did a ton of research on them did a full figma board on a strategy and how I'd work with them I shot him a personalized Loom I made him a demo chat bot and everything and I filmed the loom and I sent it off as a reply because he asked for a loom and he still hasn't seen the loom so I did this for a couple of different people who replied as well and I sent them off alone at work sometimes other times it didn't but the personalized Loom strap when you only have a couple of of leads you're playing and people interested if you have the time like I did I was able to go in and look at their Instagram and say hey XYZ this is uh this is Liam this is how I'd want to be working with you I see I've got this in your bio and I see you've got this on your website this is the kind of strategy that I'll be doing and then I showed them a demo of the a chatbot that it's set up using the same kind of system so if you have the time try the personalized Loom method if they reply saying they're interested on the whole though I'm actually pretty happy with how my first cold email campaign went considering I don't have any case study I don't have any proof of testimonials to be still getting a five percent positive response rate and being able to book some calls off that I'm pretty happy with that and I think as soon as I get a case study and some sort of testimonials and proof then I'm going to be able to get much much better response rates plus I have a ton of new domains warming up and they should be ready in a few weeks so then I'm going to be able to take my case studies from the clients that I've signed and I'll combine that with 10 new domains and I'll be able to smash out a thousand emails per day with a case study in it as proof thirdly Instagram called dming over the past week I was able to contact about 185 leads and from that I got nine replies and from there I was able to get just one call booked as I mentioned I was sending these DMS out manually so I was either on my laptop my phone copy and pasting this message and pulling up new leads and I could only send 10 to 15 per hour before you get capped on Instagram so the reason I didn't contact this many as I would have liked because it's just such a repetitive process and when you're doing that you feel like it is the biggest waste like the lowest possible leverage use of your time you're sitting here clicking click click click sending all these messages so it takes a very long time if you are doing this every hour it can really interrupt your work day because if you're having to do five minutes of Instagram Outreach and you get stuck on your phone Etc so it's really messy I'm actually in the process of getting a VA to do this which is going to automate the whole system for me so that's going to be very helpful if you do have the resources and you can hire a VA to do this for you so you can focus on higher value tasks within your business then that would be really really recommended just because if you can have someone handling that every hour and you're paying them for a couple bucks an hour then that's great when I was doing my Instagram Outreach I had to actually get a little bit smart about how can I actually get into a conversation with these online fitness coaches and how can it lead into a good pitch for me so the the strategy I ended up doing while I was still sending out just a direct pitch to a bunch of them and I did get responses from the direct pitch I started to use the strategy of dming all of these Fitness coaches I'm interested in coach or what coaching offers do you have and then I'd wait for them to reply and some of them just didn't even reply in the first place so I'd wait for them to reply and when they eventually did reply like five six seven hours later I could then say hey I'm not actually interested in your coaching but I am interested in helping you get that response time down to just a couple of seconds from eight hours so it was a pretty good pitch and I got some good responses from it I also got some really negative ones and people block me but uh it's some people get angry when you tease them in with business and then you tell them about it but others will recognize that hey this guy's trying to solve a major issue in my business and I could ask them hey are you actually doing these DMS yourself because there's ways you can automate it with AI now and it's going to save you a ton of time but it's also going to decrease your response time down to a few seconds and it's going to close a ton more business for you so that was the pitch and it did work a few times I think I got one core booked in from that another smart Strat that I used on Instagram was all of these coaches and personal trainers had a tight form in their buyer or in their link tree so it's a form to fill out to sort of sign up for their coaching program or at least apply and I was able to go through these type forms and wait for them to contact me and then when they contacted me I could actually go for the pitch one of my clients was actually signed by a combination of igdms and submitting the type form so when you're doing it get creative about it there's rules but there's the rules can be bent like for me sending these DMS out and saying hey I'm interested in coaching not many people would be thinking that way about going around actually getting in contact with them so be smart think outside the box about how you can actually get in touch with these guys how are they going to listen to you when are they going to give you the time of day to actually give them the pitch so it's a little cool straight that so if you can probably take and apply to your own Industries and finally number four we have cold calling I did my first ever cold calls I did a big sort of hour two hour session that you're going to be able to watch in a separate video I don't think you want to sit here for an hour and listen to me getting hung up on over and over again so that's going to be done in a separate video in the next week or two so if you want to watch that and see me suffer you can hit down below and subscribe to the channel hit the notification Bell so that you're notified when it comes out leave a like while you're down there if you've gotten any value out of this video it would really really appreciate it helps me to reach more people and lets me know that you guys are enjoying this content this is the kind of stuff you want to see more of cold calling is going to be covered in its own video coming out soon while on paper this may look like a roaring success it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows let me tell you something you already know the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows and it was actually quite difficult and sort of a struggle for me at times as well I was sending out all of this outbound I was sending all of these DMS and I was getting these replies back occasionally and I would put together something like a personalized loan for someone like I mentioned before like I was doing I'd spend an hour making this video for them and I'd send it off and I'd wake up the next day and check my calendar and there'd be nothing booked and I was day after day after day of just nothing getting booked and I was really really getting getting like upset and overwhelmed at some stages of this I don't know if it was me moving here to to Thailand and the time zone change and jet lag or just adapting to a new environment but for about a solid week I wasn't really feeling myself and the the pressure of this challenge was really really getting to me however I knew that if I just kept doing the work and I kept doing the right things over and over and I got enough volume eventually things would start to go my way and sure enough after about a week and a half of consistent work I managed to get a cluster of three appointments all booked in around the start of the week of currently I'm filming this and and that little cluster was my my glimmer of hope that I could actually get some clients signed and be moving forward with this challenge to give you guys some more valuable content of me actually moving forward and progressing with this so with this little cluster of sales calls collecting at the start of the week I'll have my fingers crossed and I Was preparing for them uh really really thoroughly at this stage I ate a total of three calls booked in and not all of them went well I'm going to show you now uh clips from those sales calls I'm not going to bore you with the entire amount I'm actually going to be releasing the full sales calls for you guys to see uh just how sort of on edge and nervous I was on these considering I'm selling something that I've never sold before and it was really interesting for me having done hundreds probably of sales calls from my own agency and then coming over to sell a new product that I've never really seen an action that I I haven't fully dealt with objection handling with this kind of Market before I was still a sort of jittery mess on these sales calls as you're going to see so I'll show some highlights and clips here but if you want to get access to the full sales call and see the whole process then you'll want to join my free telegram which is available in the description in the pin comment it's a new thing that I've released recently and within my telegram I'm doing daily updates and voice notes and little messages as I'm going through this process and as I'm doing this challenge so if you want to get sort of up-to-date information on how I'm going in the challenge my struggles my successes my sort of learnings to pass on to you in real time then you can join my Telegram in the description and I'm going to be posting the links to view all of the uh all of the sales calls in their full format and my telegram so if you want to jump in there all of the messages are deleted after 24 hours so if you're not in there and you don't get to see it you're not going to be able to find the link anywhere else so hopefully I'll see you all in there very soon if that's all good then I'll be firing over the content to you in a second and then you'll also get the invite invoice by stripe so if that's all good we can uh can get started in this next couple of days yeah perfect thank you very much awesome appreciate it man we'll talk to you soon bye what's the time um 809 . yeah that that's that's a no-show you can set it off oh well that's uh that's all good man lovely to love you to have this uh 60 second chat with you and get things started in the next few days so um just communicate over text for now have a good day now how do those three sales schools obviously one didn't show up but uh the first one that you saw I was able to get them signed on a free contract so they're not going to pay a thing I'm just going to set it up learn from them and really get a case studying testimonial and the final person you just saw that was actually the second call that I had with them I had one before that I booked in and then we had to follow up with a second one where I had done a bit of a plan for him that we're ready to move forward with so that was a two cool close and I was going to try and charge them and I was going to do so and we'll set this up and eventually it'll be a commission based thing or you're going to pay me per appointment booked or per conversion but I ended up just dropping that completely because I realized that this person could potentially connect me with a ton of potential clients and if I got a really good testimonial and did a good job on him then there would be more than enough compensation for me with the people you could refer me to so I said look mate your your testimonial your review is going to be Val more valuable to me in my business at this stage and if you can refer me to people because you're really happy with the service then that's going to be all the compensation I'll ever need so that was a lot easier to close on as well took the pressure off me in terms of the sales process when you don't have a lot of leads uh like like I didn't have a lot of potential people to sign I really needed that one to go through so I dropped the price down to just look I'll do it for you for free and then we're going to be able to get this thing going and and I can see this system in action and really build things out now you may be wondering where my third client came from this was actually someone I'd called dm'd on Instagram but I'd also submitted their form uh their personal training coaching form so they actually contacted me via WhatsApp because I filled out their forms I did direct line to them over WhatsApp and I just went straight in for the sale there and I talked to them for a bit turns out he's a guy sort of similar age to me and we were able to cut the rubbish and talk like just regular dudes and say hey yeah I'd love to help you this sort of thing I gave him the offer I said look I can get this thing set up for you for free if you have any other people you can refer me to then that would be a great help for my business and that's all I'm really looking for at this day so I was able to get that basically closed over text I did end up having a follow-up call them recently just to really kick things off but it was essentially closed over WhatsApp so there's no call for you to see there I think that example is a really cool one to have thrown in here that show you that it doesn't always need to take the very very formal route sometimes if you're reaching out over Instagram you can get in contact with them otherwise it can actually open that up and if using text it can really change the sales process and make it a lot more especially if you're going for a free offer and saying hey man look I just want to work with you and get this thing set up and help my business out long term and help you in the short term especially if you're reaching out from your personal Instagram to theirs so here's a summary of the clients that I have right now that I'm ready to move forward with I'm going to change their names just for privacy sakes I'm sure they don't want all of you coming over and visiting them on Instagram or trying to sell them more stuff but there's a little bit of a summary of sort of where I got in contact with them and sort of how I close them Etc and the niche that they're working in so that's where I'm at right now I've learned a ton in this process so I really wanted to finish this video off with the three top tips that I wish I knew before I started and I think are really really important for all of you who are starting your own a automation agency to know before you get started or to incorporate into what you're doing right now firstly don't try to charge your first client now I have spoken on this before and I've always said if you can charge then sure try to get that money as well but from my experience in this even in as someone who's done these kind of business says before and I have my own one it's still too much pressure if you haven't actually built out the system and you haven't seen it in action to be trying to sell something you don't even know and charging the money for it by making your services free you make it far easier for you to sell and far less stressful for you when you're delivering so when you're starting just focus on getting one client for free I've got three and I think it might be too much so just go for the one and just focus on getting the results and setting up the system first tip number two is to leverage warm Outreach as much as you can against cold Outreach on this challenge I've kind of put myself on nightmare difficulty because not only am I putting all the restrictions on that I said at the start of the video like the no ads I can't use testimonials I have to build it all myself with no Code and low code tools I'm also saying I can't use any of my connections that's probably one I should have put it at the start but it's kind of a rule that I set as I was going through this because I thought I haven't tried to get in the position of as many people as possible who are following my videos and trying to do this as well and if I just go and leverage all of my connections and pull all the strings I have in order to get this thing off the ground it's not really a accurate representation of what you guys are going through I'm trying to get in your shoes and walk a mile in your shoes with this and show you that it's possible with as little resources as possible so for me I've been doing only cold Outreach to try to get clients so basically trying to sell strangers on something they've never met me before never heard of me they haven't even really heard about they've never heard about the system that I'm selling or the kind of technology so that's hard enough when it's on its own but the fact that I'm only doing cold Outreach and trying to get this makes it a ton more difficult but what I would recommend and it's a 100 million dollar leads if you haven't read that yet Alex Emoji says your first five clients or your first ten clients you can get them from within your own network so you all have contacts in your phone you all have people who you've emailed on your email you have Facebook friends you have Instagram followers all of those people are leads that you can contact and say hey do you know anyone who would be interested in what I'm selling so go and trust me the warm is going to be far easier for you to sell than the others so contact as many people as you can that you know and say this is what I'm selling I'm doing it for free I'm looking to get some case studies do you know anyone who'd be interested so you're not asking you're in a circle directly or your contacts you're asking do you know someone this is going to be far far easier and I please if you are doing this start by doing that first just assess your entire network and anyone that you know and try to find your first clients within that because it's going to be far easier to do and tip number three be flexible with your offer initially now I started off with this idea of an AI appointment center system and while there's definitely a need for that from the feedback that I was getting and the people I was talking to and sort of the research I was doing within the niche I had to eventually sort of change my offering and modify the solution and the thing that I was trying to sell away from Strictly AI appointment settings so just qualifying and getting them to book a call to sort of a more of a product matching system where the people that I work with could throw in multiple different products and then it would be able to sort of Route the user the person that's interacting with the chatbot to the correct kind of solution for them so it's not strictly just like a straight line where it's going down to the appointment being set as the only offer but it's going down okay if they don't get qualified for the appointment then what are we going to do okay we can actually send them to other offices it's really a product matching system and I've got to change the the my landing page a bit and changed some of the messaging that I'm using to better communicate that this is more of a product matching system and I've I've called it an AI qualifier enclosure system because you're qualifying them and then closing them on something so that's kind of how I've had to change it and for many of you you will have an idea about what you think these people want to buy and what you think you should sell but you'll find out very quickly that the market may not want that you might hop on a call and they'll say yeah that's cool but like I'd really be interested in this or if it did this so be willing to adjust and don't be too robotic and fixed on just one offer that you start with it can change and it likely will change and because you've stayed to the end of the video I'm going to throw in my fourth bonus tip which is that you need to plan out your sales process this is something that I came into this challenge thinking that I knew like I've done sales for my own company I've hopped on sales calls I know how to close them and sort of move them through the pipeline but the strategies that we use at Morningside my company do not necessarily apply directly to what we're doing here and I've whilst in carrying the same things over and then I say started getting on these calls or getting replies from emails and being like what am I actually where am I pushing these people to what is the process between me contacting the first time to getting them to a closed lead so this is the sales process this is the customer Journey that you need to plan out so while you are getting started let's say you buy your emails you do your offer creation things like this as soon as you start doing outbound and you're planning your planning your campaigns you need to plan out the whole process and say okay I'm going to email them and I'm going to ask them for a reply when they reply I'm going to do this and when they do this I've got to get them booked on a call and on the call I'm looking to do this and after the call I'm looking to do this so really plan that whole process out and what each of these touch points that you're getting where you're moving them to what resources and methods you're using in order to move them down the funnel so that you know when you hop on a call whether you're going for a close or not whether you're going to book in a second meeting and things like this just really plan it out and have a clear idea it's going to help you a lot more when you're going onto these sales calls knowing what your objective is so that's the end of episode two I hope this has been valuable I've put so so much work into this and I've put myself through the ringer trying to do this where you will get in your shoes so I hope you can appreciate some of the work I'm putting in and I really hope there's some valuable information that's going to help you all get the the first step or step on the ladder that you need to really start finding

tell I'm extremely excited about this and I can't wait to see many of you in there very soon but enough talking let's get stuck into the good stuff service number one is an automated referral system they always mentioned the first three services are more systems that you can take and use in different Industries referral systems are things you can set up that are going to automate the follow-up of customers who have sort of completed working with your clients business and asking them to say hey do you know any other people who may be interested in those services and they're sort of automating that process of asking and then also facilitating the sort of handoff and then paying customers back or giving them their compensation for that referral now these systems are nothing new but the way that AI can make them more powerful is by using any data that their business has on a customer to create a personalized referralism so you ask them for a referral but you include any sort of conditional information you have on them to make it more personalized and increase the chance of a successful referral now why bother with the referral system anyway firstly the past customers of a business are highly likely to know other similar customers so they can refer you to people that they know on their Network they may know other businesses there may know other people that fit the demographic and fit the problem that they had and that you sold for them so they're sort of an ideal place to at least check and ask if they know anyone similar and secondly past customers of a business who've had a good experience are the most likely to recommend your services to others now the key thing here and the big opportunity for you as an AI automation agency owner is that most businesses don't even bother asking in the first place they don't have a system set up to even ask these questions so they're just dealing with their customers and letting them go out the door and not even attempting to to get some referrals to continue and acquire customers through them by creating and selling a solid referral system to businesses within your Niche you are opening up a new acquisition channel for them to get customers and really drive through results think about these systems is that if you're able to set up the system how to get to one referral to referrals that's a very very tangible result that you've driven for the business which is why I love any of these sort of automations as lead offers that drive sort of sales or drive real money in the door initially rather than leading with a sort of time saving automation initially so how would you actually build and deliver one of these systems firstly you need to talk to your client about how they are managing their customer data in the CRM and sort of how they are updating the status of a given client within their CRM then you can go over to zapier or make.com and set up a trigger within the CRM so that as soon as someone updates the clients are being sort of bound and we've finished our work with them that's going to trigger a set of automations that you can build on next then within the automation platform you can create an AI step or a chat gbt step and you can pull information on their customer from the CRM you can use it to create using a prompt that you've put together carefully to Output really solid messages or a sequence of messages that you can send by email or SMS then once you have the personalized message or sequence of messages you can go to another step in your Automation and you can use an email provider or you can use an SMS provider to send out these these messages or these sequences after X number of days of them being marked as done service number two is an sop search chatbot an sop search chatbot is a system that I came up with when talking to a bunch of my friends who own digital marketing agencies and they said man it would be so great to be able to have a chat what they can allow people to easily access all of the SOP resources if you're not familiar with saps it's standard operating procedures so in many businesses and agencies in particular you have all of these documents which are explaining these are how we do the systems and these are our systems and this is what we do with this and in this situation everything in the business needs to be documented in terms of how they do it so that the business can actually work and the real work that you do as much from there and as the leader of the business is to put together these Sops in a lot of cases so you put in all of this this work into creating them but at the end of the day these Sops end up putting a drive folder somewhere or they are stored somewhere in multiple different locations and it's not easy to access for your employees so the way the system works is that you can take all of the Sops for a given business and you can either put all of the text into a knowledge base and allow them to chat over the knowledge base which is one option but then there's also the the other option which is say if you have a bunch of loom videos that your team has put together and they really show and illustrate exactly how to do it you can put each of those loan video links and then a little bit of information on each into a big document and then put that document into the knowledge base and then when you chat over it you can say hey I'm looking for some help on this and it's going to return the loom link and some other related information so that the employee can then click on the link and watch it so it's a quick and easy retrieval system for employees to get and find the right say loom video for what they're looking to do now this system is so important and valuable because human beings and employees are by Nature Lazy by making the correct information more easily accessible to your employees and your staff you're going to increase the consistency and accuracy of all the tasks done so whenever they have a question they can go to this and they can find the right information far more easily rather than guessing it and maybe just making it up along the way plus you're going to minimize the number of questions that are going from your employees your low-level employees up to your managers or even to yourself so there's multiple benefits to this and that's why the system's so good and this kind of system is especially important when you have new employees that you're onboarding and they're going to need this a ton more than the regular people so how can you actually create and deliver a system like this I explained the two ways I've seen work just before where you have either put all the information into a knowledge base and just sort of chat to it as text or you can take if you have things like Loom videos or specific resources you can put them into a document and then sort of Let It Chunk Up and then it's actually going to return the links to the resources and then send them to the right place so it's more of a a resource retrieval system than a sort of text to text answering engine then to actually build the chatbot you need to use a platform like voice flow where you can build the chat what you can build the knowledge base then you can deploy it to wherever your client wants they might want to Whatsapp one to the employees can tap away on WhatsApp and ask questions or more than likely they'd want to deployed to something like slack so voicemail has a tutorial and how you can connect your voice flow chat bot to slack I'll leave the resource in the description somewhere for that and our final non-industry specific system is a product matching system a product matching system is something that I've been working with and experimenting with a lot over the past couple of weeks and my case study which is up here if you want to start watching it but through that I've been able to see the need for a a new kind of type of chatbot that allows you to match up a customer given a few bits of information you collect from them with one of the different products offers that the business that you're dealing with from for example someone with a personal brand may have a couple of different offers they have like a free course and they have like a paid course and they have like a a one-on-one coaching Etc so these different offers that they have ideal for different people in different stages of the journey now your job with a product matching system is to ask questions about the customer and get information from them and then be able to grade them against the criteria given to you by the client and essentially slap them in into one of the buckets that that fits so if they have no experience they've got no money okay they should probably take the free course first but okay they've got ten thousand dollars to spend then great they fit into the bucket of the the ten thousand dollar coaching package then you need to provide the link for that so essentially this system is just learning about the customer and then providing them the right link to convert at based on their current situation this kind of system is great because businesses are interacting more and more with customers via chat now you have Instagram you have Facebook you have SMS Etc people are interacting with businesses more and more so by having these kind of conversational selling systems is something that businesses are going to need a lot in the future the real value that these systems can provide to the business is twofold really firstly by having a flexible AI system that's able to sort of take information from the customer and then present them with the right product for them at the right time is allowing them to squeeze every last strip of money out of the attention they get and secondly you're also setting up a system that can do instant follow-up so there's no longer going to be two hour four hour eight hour delays between when the customer first messages them and when they actually start getting closed by by having that instantly and being able to follow up exactly when they are their hottest and most eager to buy you're going to increase conversions that way as well and there's also a massive bonus here of the conversations that this AI is having it's extracting really really valuable information on that lead that can be associated with it within the CRM and set up all sorts of personalized follow-ups and things like this so it's just a really really good way of collecting information and also selling them on all of your different offers now how would you actually deliver this firstly you need to go to a platform like voice flow and start to build the chatbot there and set up a few questions that it's going to ask then you have one sort of final AI step where it's going to take all of the information you've given and then check it against a criteria that's been given to you by the client then you need to actually deploy the chatbot to the platform that the client wants it might be Facebook it might be Instagram you can use things like mini chat to connect voice flow to these platforms I'll leave a tutorial from one of my community members in the description if you want help with that then I'd probably even throw in a system to save all of the conversations that happen with the chatbot and then set up something to analyze them and sort of maybe assign it to a customer or a lead within a CRM as like a bonus deliverable food sorry to interrupt the video guys but if you are enjoying the video can you please hit down below and leave a like on it right now for me that would mean the world to me I put a ton of effort into this video and the number of likes basically tells me what kind of content you want to see more of so if you leave a like it's going to let me know thank you so much and we can watch the rest of the video service number four and first of our specific examples you can take and start your AI automation agency with is an e-commerce shopping assistant an e-commerce shopping assistant is taking what we just talked about at product matching system and applying it to a specific Niche so using the same underlying concept and Technology really of let's ask some questions and we'll donate them to the right product for them this is just applying it to the e-commerce Niche and doing all of the things I'm not going to re-explain everything we just they just touched on there it's kind of personalized shopping assistance for customers to e-commerce stores can be great because as I always say people are moving more and more towards chat they're getting lazy and they don't want to click around the site 10 times to find what they want they just want to say hey I'm the assistant help me find what I'm looking for so by having the system set up you can drive more conversions because people are going to get to the product that's best for them faster and again we have an amazing bonus here for the e-commerce store owner of collecting all of this really really valuable data on the client so what are they asking what are people looking for most often what are the sort of key demographics that people are coming to the store things like this you're tapping them into a new data source which can be helpful for all sorts of decision making throughout the business so one of the steps to creating and delivering one of these it's basically the same as the product matching system you build your chatbot on voice flow you get them to ask a couple questions and you take the questions and then you check that against the criteria and that's going to allow you to sort of map it to a bunch of different products that would be ideal for it so you can create a knowledge base that's filled with all the different products in the store hopefully it's not too many and then whenever they you can query that knowledge base you'll pull back things that are most relevant to what the user's information is once you've got this recommendation engine working you can easily deploy from voice flow to a web chat so a little bubble to put on your client's eCommerce store then let's set up the conversation tracking and data analysis part as well as a bonus deliverable for the client then if you want to get more advanced and do like a V2 version you can add a feature where people can chat to FAQs of developed the given product they've been recommended so you can create a knowledge base with the information the effect use of a product and then when they get recommended you can say do you have any questions about this product and they can say yes does it do this then you answer from the knowledge base based on that product and super easy upsell is once you've got this web chat thing on their website you can say hey look I'll throw in a a customer support system for you on there as well there's another three thousand dollars service number five is a car rental chatbot system now this is a little bit of a different example I thought I'd throw these in here just to show you how far you can really be thinking on this and pick up pick a boring industry like car rental and go hey how can I actually give some value here with some kind of system using a chat bot to do a bunch of functions for the customers and for the internal team if you've ever tried to rent a car you know how much of a hassle it can be and how horrible some of the companies can be to work with so this system will be hooked up to a WhatsApp number which is available on the site of the the car rental business obviously this is kind of small to medium-sized car rental business not the big really big sort of international ones but by putting a WhatsApp number on the website a customer can click on that and they can start a chat on WhatsApp and then once they're in the chat there able to go through the booking process they can ask where they want to pick up from when they want to pick up from the chat box and send a couple cars that are available Etc take all the information in terms of do you have the right license for this yes I do that basically doing the whole booking and like onboarding process for this car rental system if you want to get really fancy you can even take payment in there as well and send like a send a payment link for the company and say please confirm when you've paid so you can do the whole system and build it up within a chatbot within WhatsApp so that the customer can get everything done on their phone via WhatsApp it's all automated for the business they're basically not even seeing any of this happen and they stroll up to the business and ready to pick up the car and show their ID Etc so automate the whole process make it easier for the business and easier for the customer then as soon as the customers picked up the car and they're officially a customer then you can open up a customer support aspect of the chatbot so they can now ask questions if you've ever traveled and had an issue with a rental car you know how much of a nightmare it is to actually get in touch with them and organize any any customer support related issues so by adding a customer support feature into the chatbot as soon as they're actually using the car then they can say hey I've had an issue with this or hey what's the issue with uh returning on the on the tank of gas Etc all of the customer support can be 24 7 responding to the customer but also automated so that the AI is answering majority of the questions they're only sending them really tricky or emergency request to the business so how would you actually build and deliver this system or you'd start on something like voice flow in order to build the chatbot out into different steps involved and then you'd be able to integrate it from voice flow over to something like zapier or make.com and there's a lot of Integrations there at those sort of onboarding systems and stripe links Etc takes a lot of Integrations back and forth within the chatbot provider and your automation platform but it's definitely impossible it's definitely something you can do and once you've got a little built out and working you can deploy that to a WhatsApp number for the business Via twilio SMS and and voice flow makes this very easy to do as well and then it's just a case of getting a retainer deal struck with the client and then managing the system moving forward service number six is and don't laugh pool cleaning lead gen chatbot system this is another one of those unorthodox examples that I'm trying to throw at you into sort of broaden your mind as SGD possibilities of the kind of systems you can create as an AI automation agency owner I mean he never would have thought of focusing on the pool cleaning Niche but as I'm about to explain this new technology and chatbots especially open up new doors for interesting and competitive advantages that you can provide to even the most boring of businesses so the pool cleaning industry obviously pretty low Tech on the on the Spectrum there and probably low amounts of innovation going on especially in terms of how people are acquiring customers which is what we're focusing on here now I'm not an expert on pool cleaning but I would say that the sort of lead gen and customer acquisition strategies amongst the industry are fairly competitive and there's not many new angles to take so an example of a system that you could build in order to give a certain pool cleaning company the Competitive Edge in generating leads and customers is to create a chat bot and then have it available on their website as a lead magnet like claim your free pull testing kit here and they click it and it opens up a chat bot on might be in an SMS based one it might be a WhatsApp one it might even be on the web but the idea is that they're able to claim their free testing kit within the chat bot and then they say okay here's your address we're going to ship this out you want to make the connection so that when the customer sends their address you're able to take that and pass it off to the logistics system or whatever they're going to actually ship that testing cut out the idea is that when they get the testing the testing pool they're supposed to come back to the chatbot and say hey here's my results what do I need for my pool what kind of chemicals am I going to need and that's when you can use AI to analyze those results and match them up to a set of chemicals that are going to be right for their pool and then you can sell them a subscription a plan to purchase those chemicals every month or every three months or whatever the interval is so with that you can see a really cool kind of automated lead generation system going on there that not many other competitors will be able to do because there's a lot of sort of manual matching up work to do and a lot of conversations that we have this is going to give your pool cleaning company a competitive advantage in terms of generating leads and customers when using the system just for about it so how would you actually build and deliver this those steps I just went through is exactly what you need to do but you need to get something like voice flow as the sort of Bot Builder and the environment in which you build it and then you need to do these different Integrations like sending the information when you get the address off to your client and one of them to ship the package you need to get a lead magnet set up on their website or get the client and customer of yours to actually promote it so that people are coming to this offer in the first place then once you've made up the chatbot it's just deploying it to whatever platform the client wants what's our SMS Etc and then you can sign a retainer to manage the system ongoing and finally service number seven is a restaurant chatbot system now there's nothing too fancy about this it's basically people want to know about a restaurant they want to know about its menu they want to book in and this can all be done through WhatsApp now you may know depending on where you live America is not very big on it but the rest of the world is a lot of restaurants are already using WhatsApp to handle questions that customers have or handle bookings as well so your job is just to automate that process to allow people to check availability for a given time and then if it is to be able to book it in automatically in the system so restaurants already have if they do have a WhatsApp number or they have someone on the phone taking all these dials that's a lot of time that someone is spending and the goal for you is to be able to automate all of that process bookings cancellations Etc but also allowing people to chat to the menu so you might have a button and you your home menu which is hey I have a question about your menu or well I have a question about your business Etc then you can use a knowledge base nothing fancy put information about the menu put the information about the business opening time Etc put it all in there and they're able to ask questions to it but the key thing here is that you can deploy it not only to Whatsapp you can also put it in the igdm so a lot of high-end restaurants these days are using Instagram as running promotions of course they take photos of the food and they get a whole bunch of business that way so you can have a DM me book or something like this to trigger a conversation so they can actually book and Via Instagram or at least just get information about the menu as I just mentioned how can you actually deliver this it's the same sort of process you use voice flow you build out the different steps and then you're able to deploy it to your given platform the point to Instagram does take that tutorial that I mentioned before so if you want it it's from one of my community members how you can connect manychat up to voice flow in order to get it working on igdm so that's available in the description the reason I wanted to throw this one in here is because I think it's an opportunity that everyone has a chance to really jump on because it's one there's so many restaurants there's like millions and millions restaurants around the world and you have a sort of unique opportunity to just Waltz into these restaurants and try to get a conversation with the manager and say hey how much time are you guys spending on answering all these messages wouldn't it be great to have your managers spending their time doing things that's actually more valuable to the business and you can use a little psychology trick in order to get a chance to talk to the owner by sitting down having a meal at the restaurant which is a great excuse to go out and have a dinner with yourself with your partner but the reciprocity factor of when you've paid them and you've you're eating at the restaurant they kind of have to come and give you two seconds to talk to them in a lot of cases so go to a restaurant sit down have a meal and say hey can I talk to the manager or is he only here I'd love to talk to them about something so that's a bit of free game on a straight you can use in person to try and close some of these restaurant plans

then that's on you that's why I have a shaved head and I don't know when I'll grow it out again but for now it's good for me Triple A is a scam LOL yeah I mean what's going on everyone today I'm doing my first ever YouTube q a here in Thailand I'm out here with my entire team for the next month and I thought I've had a number of requests to do something like this where I get a little bit more personal I don't really tell too much about who I am in my personal life and my story really so I thought I'd answer a few of your questions from my Instagram story if you're not already following me on Instagram and want to see the kind of things I get up to a little bit more personal with my friends and the business that we're doing you can follow me on Instagram it'll be in the description or just search me up Liam Motley I'm sure you're going to be able to find me but I'm going to be doing a lot more interactions sharing the results from my accelerated Community talking to people in my community a lot more via q and A's Etc um if you want to be tapped into all of that and not miss anything I'm doing be sure to follow me on Instagram in the description Daddy's Money laughing face laughing face kind of wanted to address this now because I think I might give that kind of vibe away that I'm like daddy's money like private board private school kid but no I come from a low-income family my mom and dad were never really together and then when I was nine they broke up so my family's always been split my mum's a receptionist and my dad's a farmer we don't have money I had all the things I needed I had a great family and a great upbringing but we never had money they weren't throwing me hundreds of dollars a week in allowance I was living at a boarding school for nine years of my life and the boarding school was full of poor kids so the only way that myself my brother got into the boarding school and sort of changed her life from me it was by being poor because the scholarship's based on a lack of money in the family and also split parents or dead parents and stuff like that so just to dispel the daddy money thing I know I might dress in a way that Mike radio those vibes now but I definitely wasn't always like this I didn't always have a gold chain and a nice haircut this is a sort of recent occurrence for me and I'm probably very very similar to many of you watching this video in terms of how I grew up and my background background before Triple A yes I think some of you are familiar with my story I started off as soon as I left High School I moved to Scotland and I did a gap here there where I taught myself to I got a Tai Lopez course of all things and it's funny how many people in the space now that I meet who got their start in this game through Tai Lopez's course so I bought his course when I finished high school started trying to Dropship for the entire year that I was living overseas in Scotland lost all my money failed over and over and over again but then fortunately I met my mentor who's now my business partner and using his his method I was able to start making a lot of money with e-commerce and that really taught me marketing and I was able to roll that into working and becoming a minority partner with him on his marketing agency as well so myself my business partner and Mentor we were able to run up his marketing agency from there then once I was happy with the position that I was in in my sort of marketing skill set I decided to take a bit of a Hiatus from the marketing work strictly and teach myself to code because I've read the naval rubicon's Almanac if you haven't read a great book anyone looking to get started on entrepreneurship or just wanting to live a happy and fulfilling life definitely check out the almanac of Nevada but I believe in there was where I heard the phrase if you learn to sell and learn to build you'll be unstoppable and I was like this guy's smart if I'm gonna listen to anyone I should probably listen to him and I already had the marketing side of things figured out I was like I'm pretty sure I know how to sell things now based on my experience why don't I Circle back to something that I've done in high school which was building apps doing Swift mobile apps for iPhone and I was like I really enjoyed that I think I can come back to it so I taught myself the code over the the next two years sort of 18 months and with that I was able to get into large language models and start using things like that to do it's like classification and sentiment analysis and when I learned those things we're able to actually start selling those kind of sentiment analysis services to our agency clients with marketing agency and from there when chat GPT came out and sort of blew the whole industry open I was actually like perfectly positioned I had the marketing skills here I had my business partner now our company there but I had this new skill set of being able to code machine learning everything and I was just able to take that opportunity and run with it and sort of the rest ancestry so Drop Shipping e-commerce their marketing agency one business partner and more recently taught myself to code became a self developer and was happened to be perfectly positioned to jump on this opportunity when it came so that's my background before I've created the AI automation agency model how did the Triple A model change your life I think firstly it's changed my life on the business side of things when we were running warningside is strictly a development company doing custom projects it was quite repetitive we was a lot of calls and admin that was really really tiring and wore me down by being able to transition over to an automation agency model and being able to streamline a lot of processes and simplify what we're delivering down that did a a huge thing for me in terms of me being able to relax as a business owner not having to worry about it getting some more replicability and sort of reusability in the things we're building so on the business side of things it definitely made things a lot more straightforward for me also being able to tap into this massive pool of smaller businesses who wanted to work with us but we couldn't do before so let's say that's one thing on the business side but on the more personal side the Triple A model has really done the most for me in terms of me sharing it here on YouTube and being able to connect with so many amazing people it's been a new experience for me I was never planning to be a YouTuber I never wanted to be I thought it was a stupid thing to be doing and I'd never be successful at it but to my surprise we grew from zero to 90 000 subscribers in under eight months which was mind-boggling to me and with that came the ability to meet a wide array of new people from different Industries different backgrounds and that really has been the biggest thing that's changed about my life is being able to connect with other people and just making a broader group of friends across the world so I'd say that is a really significant part and the the rewarding side of being able to teach people and say that these people are getting results they're making money with this business model that I created is uh a very very interesting experience for me and something that I'm really really eager to pursue more if you couldn't already tell when are you reopening your AAA accelerator yeah so we are reopening that within the next week or two we as I said we're only letting in 150 people initially and those spots were gone in two minutes fortunately we've had that packed out we've been getting really really good reviews and responses from people so I'm now happy to open the accelerator up to a large group of people I think we'll take on another couple hundred people but we are going to be having a cap again cap the number of people in there just so we can really make sure we've scaled up our systems but important thing to note is that the price will actually be going up this time around just because we've added so much value and I think this is going to be a trend moving forward with the accelerator as we get better and better coaches in there and we get better and better workshops as well I mean we have Alex and Aussie coming in to do a talk with my accelerator we also have the founder of instantly coming in in a few weeks who's a friend of mine to do a workshop on cold email so this is the kind of value that we're packing in so the the price does have to increase but the key thing I'll mention is that the people who got in for 59 a month are being able to lock in at that rate and get all the benefits of our like 200 a month plan but they're locked in at 60 so if you want to lock in and get the best price possible because we're going to continue to increase it most likely as we add more value then you probably want to get in on this batch and sort of secure your your price point there because we're not going to expect you to pay more but if you're locked into that price then you'll have that secured for as long as your membership lasts sacrifices for your current life this is an interesting one now this idea of sacrifices to me seems a little bit ridiculous given my my current life and and the privileged life I love I'm grateful for it every single day in my notebook I write I'm grateful for this incredible life that I get to live it still blows my mind every day that I get to do the exact thing that I dreamed of which is working with people that I love on things that I love working with wherever I want on my own schedule like if this was the dream for me and I've been living the dream my dream for the past three years now so I think for someone in my position to be talking about sacrifices is a bit ridiculous really yes I I've never seen my family I see them sort of once a year I go back to New Zealand for Christmas and maybe a month and then I travel and I'm overseas the rest of the year so that's probably the biggest sacrifice is not being able to be around my family as much but I think in the next few years I'll have the time and sort of the resources to be able to not necessarily be bound to one area as much you could say that I sacrificed my early 20s to be in the position I am now while everyone was at University having a great time drinking smoking doing whatever they want to do I was in my room working non-stop I was living overseas and sort of in a crunchy little apartment just trying to get things going and that was for two or three years is really so I always saw people having fun having the greatest time at Uni and I went to UNI in New Zealand for six months and I had scholarships thrown at me from everyone and everyone I gave all the scholarships up to go and do this thing that I'm doing now so that was definitely a sacrifice just sort of throwing all of the scholarship money that I've been given and the Ben and going to chase this this crazy German plan to be able to work and live on my own so when it comes to sacrifices yeah they definitely are some but the benefits definitely outweigh that and I definitely don't look at them as like some massive thing I had to give up because I lived such a a blessed life now toughest part of your journey toughest part of my journey was definitely the start I think for all of you who are just starting out on this journey as well this is the toughest part for you when you have no skills you just completely disorientated you have no understanding of business no understanding of how the world Works especially if you're 18 like I was at the time I was living in this crusty little flat in Edinburgh and from there out of that room I can put some pictures up on screen of like what I had on my walls and the kind of stuff I was doing to motivate myself I actually have my mentor and who's now my business partner stuck up on my walls before I'd even met him I had him stuck up on my wall with his name and then how old he was and the stuff he was doing I had this little little tiny bedroom and I was doing all of my work out of there I would be getting up at 5 30 starting my work on my drop shipping stores and doing that until I had to go to work at about 8 30 going to work coming back at about 3 30 going to the gym and then from the gym I just go straight into working again and work until 11 or 12 at night so I was that's definitely the longest hours I've ever had to put in just trying to squeeze it in around a normal job so that was that was definitely the toughest one and it's so cold the darkness Scotland I mean I love eating better bits but this was definitely the hardest part when you're just this little kid who has no clue what he's doing and you feel like no one's there to help you either you're just completely alone so the toughest part for me was definitely that first year where I spent all of my time doing it and lost all of my money and didn't make a diamond profit so that's how it started out for me why AI automation agencies fair question to ask I think with so many different opportunities in the online business space right now it's a good question to ask before you jump into anything like this but I've said it time and time again I am so big on this opportunity and the reason I created the model in the first place was because there's always an opportunity to facilitate the uptake and the adoption of new technology and AI is going to be one of the biggest Technologies in the next decade historically there's always been an enormous opportunity to make money when new technology comes about and if you can facilitate the adoption of the new technology and integration of it into businesses then you stand to make a lot of money so that's the entire premise that the AI automation agency model is built on it's just that it's this new technology businesses are going to want to integrate it to get a competitive Advantage you can help them get that Advantage by creating services or packages of products that can help them to achieve that so that's why I'm so big on it and it's ridiculous when I hear people talking about this it's a scam or like Triple A is a scam it doesn't exist it's not real how can you sit there and say that there is zero opportunity for you to help businesses adopt AI technology one of the biggest Trends right now one of the biggest technological advancements with so much money being made you are seriously saying that there is no opportunity at all for you to make some money at doing it I think that's completely ridiculous and I I kind of laugh when I see those kind of comments who are the people you looked up to in business when you were coming up in your own career yeah I I've had a number of sort of idols and people that I really looked up to throughout my journey you have like the really far off ones I had like Richard Branson I've read his book probably three or four times losing my virginity it's a great book and reading that really put a clear frame of what I could do as an entrepreneur in the kind of exciting life and world changing things that you can do for me reading that book and hearing Richards entice story was like wow if I could look back on my life and write a book on my life I'd want it to sound a bit like that or at least close to it so he was always one of the top sort of idols and business role models that I aspired to be like and not only invisibility as a businessman but the things he's done outside of it and sort of family he's built and things like this I think he's definitely one of my top top role models and Idols in the business space while having those sort of Mega Idols Like Richard Branson off in the distance I think for me at least on my journey it was important to have someone that was a little bit closer and seemed more attainable like obviously Richard Branson's is a long way off but for me it was actually my business partner who's currently my business partner but was whilst my mentor and once a guy that I never even knew and I just stopped on Instagram my business partner Josh for me Josh was the one that I looked up to because I remember seeing an article in the newspaper about him in New Zealand saying this young guy making all this money and jumping around the world and then I found his Instagram and I started watching all his Instagram highlights and things like this I'm like man this is the guy I have to be it's like I really really idolized and looked up to Josh I even stuck him on my wall in Scotland I'll put that picture up on the screen somewhere this is before I even knew him or like kind of relationship with them so he was sort of the the guy that I looked to in the sort of near-term like this guy's done it I can do it too and ironically at the time of filming this we're actually in the same Resort that I remember looking at his stories when I was like 18 19 staring at his story saying wow this looks so cool he was staying at this exact same Resort and now what three or four years later I'm here with him as a business partner with all of my friends working for us with this amazing company we're building it's like a full circle moment for me and it's it's really kind of surreal that I'm here now doing the things that I've always dreamed of doing and then finally one more person I've really looked up to has been quite a a business Mentor for me would be liquor Nets you may be familiar with him he's now the CEO and killing it with pudgy Penguins what I really appreciate and learned from Luca was how he is very very grounded and down to earth with his community and makes himself very very accessible and I think the way that he approaches entrepreneurship is something that's really really lacking in the space and I I really like looking to him as a role model as to how I should be around my community and the kind of us that I can be and sort of not necessarily being this aggressive over the top entrepreneur but being a a sort of down to earth and grounded person that's approachable and that can actually be relatable to some people what is your AAA accelerator so mate AAA accelerator is my pay Community it's on a subscription basis right now it's currently 59 a month but it'll be going up to I think 97 but it's my my community where I'm able to hire coaches and bring people into sort of magnify my ability to teach and amplify it from just me to having a whole Suite of coaches and we do three workshops every week in there on everything you can imagine so not only are you getting the three workshops you also get access to all of the prior recordings so we have things like postlines similarity tests we have offer creation workshops we have everything under the sun we have I mean Alex mozzie's coming in there instantly Founders coming in there to do a cold email Workshops the longer we go on the more of these workshops are going to be saved and the more value you're going to be able to get as soon as you get into the accelerator so I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that the education and the resources we're giving away in my accelerator is by far the number one resource for not only AI automation agent see the model but also just learning AI in general we have like five star AI education going on in there with my CTO from Morningside coming in and doing talks about different sort of technical aspects of AI and how it works and some deep like theoretical and conceptual understanding of AI itself if you're not just looking to build your own AI automation agency but also just learn Ai and get deeper and deeper into the space then I can wholeheartedly say that you need to be getting into that accelerator in the next batch which will be opening up very soon so if you haven't already hopped on the waitlist it's going to be available in the description you can get on the waitlist there and it'll be going to be giving away a few hundred spots so if you want to be in there you need to be quick but we are going to be opening it up in the near future favorite vacation country or dream country to live yeah I think it's important to distinguish between vacation countries and living well when you live kind of like I do and you're sort of nomadic to some degree but I'm based out of Dubai for five or six months of the year and the rest of the year I'm sort of traveling around to different places we don't really get time for vacations that often I as you may have seen in my previous video I was in Croatia for my sort of one week off for the year and that was my vacation I'm still working to some degree while I was on there but my favorite spots for a vacation strictly when I'm not doing anything I'm trying not to work definitely sort of Amalfi Coast in Italy I love going there Greek Islands you can't beat it Croatia more recently from going on the trip I really liked it but also the Caribbean so I went to my first Caribbean island to do my Marathon earlier this year and that was a really really amazing experience for me it's something I definitely want to check out more so probably say the Caribbean Caribbean islands I want to check that out more as a vacation spot than sort of the regular European Sports I'm off the coast Croatia Greece as well so those are my favorite vacation spots all when it comes to actually living I really enjoy my time in Dubai it's really focused I have a good group of friends here being there for five or six months of the year is great but when it comes to actually living in a place where I can lock in I can do my work and really live there south of Spain is great I love my Baya around the area I've spent a lot of time there also like places like Thailand now and Bali I think Bali is a great spot to be posted up at if you've got the right mix of people with you and then also I enjoyed my time in median in Colombia being able to practice my Spanish a lot more just completely different living experience to what I'm used to in Europe and Dubai and stuff like that so those are probably my three favorite spots and vacation spots as well AAA is a scam LOL yeah I mean these are the same people who said that Ecom and Drop Shipping was a scam that Israel May was a scam that all these different things because they're Trends they're a scam like if you look at e-commerce where was the trend where was the fall off like it's still in most one of the largest and most established Industries in the world now so if you were to get into Ecom when it first started you've now built a skill set one of the largest and most profitable Industries you could be in as a small entrepreneur it's all entrepreneur so same thing with smma you could say like oh it's just as Korean it's just a scam it's like this this and this but this multi 100 like nine figure marketing agencies that came out of the smma training so how in the hell are you saying that triple A and and building on top of this brand new and exciting technology that's going to change our entire world as a scam there's going to be nine figure seven-figure companies that come out of this AI Revolution and and companies that help facilitate this AI Solutions companies things like this these are going to come out of it and you can either choose to call it a scam or you can choose to take part in it and get your slice to pie while you have a chance like if you puss around too long you're going to miss it and you're going to be looking at waiting for the next Trend and you're still going to be saying it's a scam that kind of stuff does annoy me a little bit and I mean if you look at the biggest technological advancement in the next decade and you seriously can't make any money in it and that's on you that's a skill issue on you that you weren't able to do it so there's money to be made it's definitely in an area like AI using a model like the AI automation agency model why do you have a shaved head why no does not look good you don't like it I quite like it I mean I've had every hairstyle Under the Sun if you've checked out my Instagram I've had shoulder length here I've had like the sort of tick-tock looking guy haircut I've made all of them um and for me this is the like lowest maintenance when I'm traveling Barbers it's really more practical than anything I got sick of traveling around and Bob is messing up my hair when I had sort of a longer top and eventually I was just like look if you're a barber and you can stuff this up then you're a pretty bad Barber so I figured if I reduce my hair requirements of the skill needed to cut my hair down to just a fade on the sides then surely I can travel year round and have like a nice Cut and it's turned out to be true I got this like got a haircut from somewhere every kit the other day and it turned out to be great so it's more practical it doesn't get hot in the Summer Wherever I am I know it might not be the most appealing one but for me it's very very low maintenance makes me look a bit older and I don't know I like it it also has a little bit of a deeper meaning as well in that I believe as a man your hairstyle shouldn't matter it's not a significant part no one's going to judge you as a man on how fancy your hairstyle looks so for me this is practical does the job and and it's not really like dressing me up it's like making me look at sort of bad as possible so that my true qualities can can shine through and they might probably some business my my personal all these different things is what's carrying me not having a fancy hairstyle so that's why I have a shaved head and I don't know when I'll grow it out again but for now it's good for me now I'm actually in the process of putting together a My Story video giving you like the full walkthrough of my entire life and my story and how I've gotten to where I am now

              "text": "so for the next 30 days I'm going to build an AI automation agency from complete scratch and take it to ten thousand dollars in Revenue all while on vacation and if I cannot do so I'm going to pick someone from the comment section on this video and PayPal them one thousand dollars now I need to prove to everyone that it wasn't just luck that I was able to build my own AI automation agency from zero to tens of thousands of dollars per month in Revenue so in order to prove this I came up with a plan so my plan is to follow these three rules rule number one is that everything I do must be completely separate from my agency Morningside AI this means a new name a new site and definitely no testimonials to start with the offer that I do show to the prospect will need to be shown without any previous clients work rule number two is that I can only use no Code and low code platforms when creating my deliverables I cannot use my own development company to custom code things I must do it myself and rule number three is that I cannot run any kind of paid advertising in order to get clients keeping my budget as close as possible to zero so let's get started [Music] step number one I need to get the foundations laid for my agency this starts with Niche selection now creating an AI automation agency is a unique opportunity right now because it is a new model within a relatively new industry which has advantages and disadvantages that we need to be aware of while selecting our Niche the advantage is that basically every industry right now is untapped meaning there is opportunity wherever you look so if you can find product Market fit and create an offer around this in one of these untapped markets then you will make a lot of money however the disadvantage is that because we are so early we are only just starting to identify the proven offers that work within a given Niche so with this in mind we are left with two options firstly we can approach a completely unproven and untapped Niche and we can find a partner within this industry to work with in order to identify the highest impact opportunities for AI Integrations within the industry and then we can create a package or an offer around what we get from that partnership essentially doing deep market research to figure out what the industry needs so that you can go on and sell that to others well secondly we can go with one of the proven offers that have been already identified within the space and run with that considering I only have 30 days to make this work I'm going to be going with one of the proven offers from my recent work with my free incubator students or the original eight we have identified a huge need for appointment setting chat Bots across various niches in fact one of the guys within the incubator Isaiah has actually signed a number of clients with his appointment sitting chatbot offer in the past few weeks therefore within this challenge I will be creating an appointment setting chatbot agency initially focused on personal training now the reason why I've chosen personal trainers as my niches because they deal heavily with qualifying potential clients before they get on calls with them so they can benefit hugely from an AI appointment setup and I've also checked this Niche against my Niche selection criteria and it's past the flying colors so we're good to go here now if you want a nitty-gritty breakdown of my process for starting an agency including things like my Niche selection criteria I actually have a two hour long beginners guide video so if you haven't watched that and you want to see the whole process that I'm doing within this video be sure to go and watch that and give you all of the information you need now with my Niche and my deliverable locked in I'm ready to start step number two offer creation Now this stage in particular is absolutely crucial to the success of this challenge I'm actually in Croatia on my vacation right now so not wanting to waste a day cooped up inside I headed down to the Waterfront and I took with my laptop my notebook and of course the essential resource 100 million dollar offers by Alex and Moses I found a nice restaurant to post-op at and locked out a huge offer planning workshop for the specific challenge now the way I usually start this offer creation process is to identify as Alex says the dream outcome for the client and for on each personal trainers I figured this would be something along the lines of to become one of the top trainers in the world with thousands of successful clients and have a huge following now with that dream outcome identified my next job was to highlight how an effective appointment sitting system is a significant if not the most significant factor and them achieving the stream outcome next I needed to drill down to the pain points that personal trainers are experiencing with their own appointment setting systems that currently use real people and then finally with all of this set up out of the way I can present my chat Bots as the solution and to do this I use tomazi's problem to solution system and then bundle these all together and then added the secret source of guarantees and scarcity Etc and the result was three potentially Grand Slam offers that I can start testing in the real world now these three different offers that I've come up with are really just different takes on the pricing structure for the core deliverables here on screen I'm going to Rattle through this pretty quickly so feel free to pause it these are the core deliverables but then we also have bonus deliverables as well what you're really going to be used to push urgency so that people can act when I ask them to now these are just some of the bonus deliverables that came out of my offer Workshop I mean all of these are rolled into three different pricing tapes really so firstly we have commission based it's a free setup and then I'm going to be taking four percent of all the deals that are closed that's sort of Industry standard for appointment Setters is around five to seven percent so I'm kind of undercutting that with this four percent adding some urgency and scarcity as well then secondly we have a retainer based offer which is going to be a free setup in the 2 500 per month after that then finally we have our third offer which is an upfront fee plus a completion fee and then also download usage base beyond that so we have two thousand dollars up front fifteen hundred upon completion upon delivery of the system and then we also we have a one dollar permissive Cent now this is kind of variable it can change around it could be a one dollar or three dollar per message sent it could be a twenty dollars per call book but basically it's going to be done on usage and these are the different with pricing these different offers so it's the same underlying deliverables and then the bonuses that I'm sprinkling in but there's three different takes on how I can actually price it so these are all going to be worth testing in the near future if you want to get access to all of the bonus deliverables that I've come up with plus things like the guarantees that I'm using Etc it's all going to be available in the first link in the description so you can head down there and get access to that now tomorrow my friends that I'm going to be spending the next two weeks with are actually arriving here in split in Croatia with me so they're all business owners and I thought who better to test these offers on uh than a bunch of business owners like them so let's see what they think about the offers for my new AI automation agency please [Music] all right we got lamps here um the AI appointment so that agency and I'm starting so the idea is that you can get wherever you get your leads in you can then start a conversation by SMS or Instagram VM whatever it's going to be doing some trainers but the idea is that I can do it on a commission basis so it's three percent fee for any course block get anything that closes um or you could order retainer with yourself proper fees so I know you guys have all sorts of things I wanted to get your thoughts on it while you have a lands here no I think it's a good idea I have an education company and an e-commerce fund so I would definitely use it for everything follow-up wise marketing business and one of the main things that we do is influence our Outreach and primarily it comes through like and stuff and then also going yeah like Instagram DMS and stuff but the follow-up process with Instagram DMS is offered with the set of sequences and whatnot so it's we save a lot of uh time consumes on that it's Mr sales over here that is so clutch because I I was gonna hire uh was it VA yeah underwear man that's what we keep going for like what we're talking about is that like the turnover for these guys it's so high because um yeah I'm with bcis I'm in the influencer marketing space as well and it's just a no-brainer just [Music] now we're back just a few days later I've finished off my trip in Croatia which was an absolute blast uh we're now here in Phuket in Thailand uh we're here for the next month and while I was on my cell week the first thing I did was decide on a domain uh this is sort of the business setup of what we're going to be doing now I looked around on GoDaddy for a couple different ones and I did settle on a cool one that I really really think fits this this business and this challenge well what we're going to be running with is set with ai.com so as in set your calls with ai.com which I think is a pretty cool and brandable name so I secured that and GoDaddy and then I took that over to click funnels and I wanted to build out at least a basic landing page I know I tell you guys not to do this but I think for the purpose of this because I already have an offer that I'm going to be running and I've decided on it I do have the time to set up a landing page for it as well so I went on to click funnels I set up a basic landing page which you're going to be able to be seeing on screen now it'll also be a link in the description for you to check out what I did but very basic just a headline calling out the Avatar I've got a little video of myself that I just shot before here so that didn't take me long at all maybe a couple of hours but the key thing here is that the landing page didn't take long because I did all the hard work when it came to offer creation so I actually did a ton of work on the offer creation side of things as you may have seen earlier but I do have an enormous document showing you the exact steps that I took as sort of a a visual breakdown and sort of brain dump of all the different stages I took following homozy's blueprint of course so if you want to get access to that I'm going to make it available to my AAA accelerated community so if you're not already in there we are on a waitlist currently we've sold out of the wait list and I think two minutes the 150 spots was gone so we are going to be opening that up in the near future so if you are interested in joining my AAA accelerator where we have coaches teaching you everything you need to know you have people you can talk to we have really experts in there that I'm hand picking

Ozzie to come into our Discord and do a one hour workshop with all of us now you guys may have seen on my newsletter or my community or even here on the YouTube Community post that we were trying to

              "text": "over the past year I've built and sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of AI chat Bots to clients all over the world most of which were built on no code platforms so in this course I'm going to be teaching you absolutely everything that I know about building AI chat bots so that you can have the same sort of success as a freelancer as a business owner by utilizing this amazing new technology over the past year I've been on hundreds of Consulting calls and had hundreds of conversations with people within my Discord community and I keep hearing the same question where can I learn what you know unfortunately I've never really had a good answer for them there's no course there's no degree there's no one YouTube channel that has a beginner to expert resource for AI chatbot building until now and so I'm creating this video as a public service really to provide a complete resource for people wanting to learn this new and valuable skill to create a new source of income to help grow their business us or just to come up to speed on the current state of this new and exciting technology I've spent weeks preparing this content for you all and what you're about to learn is the result of a year of trial and error in my own chatbot development Journey this video is the resource that I wish I had when I started my journey over a year ago as I'm sure you can already tell by the length of this video we have a lot of information to get through today so I'm going to have timestamps as always so feel free to skip around but these are the things we're going to be covering in today's video firstly we're going to be quickly diving into what the AI chatbot opportunity really means for people like you and I this includes a brief discussion of the macro factors that are at play what sort of Trends we're writing here the main drivers for this if you're completely new to my channel and aren't aware of the huge opportunity to sell chatbots to businesses I'd definitely recommend you start from the beginning and listen to that because there's quite a lot of background you need to know before you can start to really see the opportunity that's in front of us then I'm going to be giving you a deep dive on the different kinds of chatbots that are available to build within the market and the sort of pros and cons of each then we're going to be jumping into an analysis of the best softwares available this is going from prototyping to full chatbot Builders to tools I'm going to be covering everything so that you guys are aware of what exists on the market and you guys can go straight to the best ones rather than spending all the time I've done working with the bad ones then we're going to be getting our hands dirty by breaking down the key concepts of chatbot building and sort of AI in general so that you're able to understand and have a foundation of knowledge that you can build your knowledge on chat box on top of and then finally we're going to be taking all of the information and things that we've just learned and put them into practice by building nine different chat Bots live step by step for you guys to follow along at home the chat Bots we're going to be building range from extremely basic all the way up to extremely Advanced so you're going to get to go step by step and improve your chatbot building skills all the way through and we're going to be teaching it on one of the most powerful bot boarding platforms so you're building a skill set already that is going to be valuable for years to come and then finally I've thrown in a little bit of a bonus which I think is necessary at the end of this video on how you can actually take the chatbot building skills and building the chat Bots and start selling it to businesses so all of that is going to be covered at the end of the video once you have the skills required to do so now before we get started there are a few things that you're going to need firstly you have to go and get a notebook you can't watch this video without a notebook and a pin there's just no way that you can watch all of this and not take a couple notes down so go get a notebook or go get a pin go get a coffee I've got mine you're also going to need an open mind to these new Concepts that are coming in and also there's a lot of sort of mental resistance I get from people sometimes talking about chat Bots and thinking there's no way that you could sell them for that much you're also going to need an open mind to the new things I'm about to teach you but also to to keep an open mindset really that anything that you want to learn you can learn it there's no sort of I'm a developer I'm not a developer or I'm a this Runner that have an open mind and be ready and confident in your ability to learn anything you want if you put your mind to it and I assure you that if you're watching this you definitely can do what I'm going to show you in this video and finally what I need you to do right now is pause this video close all of your tabs come back to this video and save it to your watch it down below leave a like And subscribe while you're down there if you want to support me because you need absolute focus on this video for the next two hours two and a half hours however long this ends up being I'm prepared to sit here for five or six hours to film this for you guys so I'm sure you can sit there for two hours to listen to this whole thing and take notes so if you've got your notebook you've got your pen you've got your coffee open mind and you're also fully focused on this video and this tab only then we're ready to get started now before you spend two hours listening to some guy on the internet I'm sure you're going to want to know a little bit of background about me so you know you're not wasting your time and why you should even listen to me at all so a little bit about me my name is Liam otley and I'm an online entrepreneur from New Zealand but now based in Dubai and currently in Europe for the summer I'm the creator of the AI automation agency or Triple A as it is known and I'm also running the largest community of AAA owners in the world we have about 23 000 members in there which I'm teaching to regularly I've been doing online business for nearly five years now and as you can see I've had nearly as many hairstyles as I've had years in the game and through my online businesses I've been fortunate enough to build the life of my dream is where I live where I want I work with the people I love working with and I get to work on things I really love working on my main focus right now is on building and scaling my AI Automation and AI development company called Morningside AI as you can see on screen here we have three parts of the company Morningside AI Morningside Automation and our Morningside studio and collectively they're doing about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars per month now so that's up a little bit from last month if you've seen my previous videos we do a number of different things including building custom AI applications for clients but also complete business automations with AI and AI integration I want to point out that a significant chunk of our monthly revenue is coming from our automation side which is using the exact same skills that I'm going to be teaching you in this video to build chat Bots using low code and no code platforms so all of that stuff that you're going to learn is applicable to the exact same kind of stuff that we're using to generate tens of thousands of dollars per month in Revenue so that's a little bit about me about my background my company what I do and why you might want to listen to a two or three hour video from it I'll leave that up to you to decide one last thing before we get into the video I wanted to let you all know that the waiting list for my AI automation agency accelerator is now open in my last video I asked you all as my community if you'd be interested in me putting together as some kind of exclusive community that would be led by coaches that are hand-picked by me that are industry experts in their given fields in order to sort of hold your hand and walk you through step by step on your AI automation agency Journey if you've been following me for a while you know that my method has always been to give everything away for free and then I can sell on the implementation via Morningside AI my development company however I've been feeling that perhaps this is actually hindering the potential of some of you more than it's actually helping you and it seems like many of you agreed based on the results that we got from the poll that I put out ninety percent of you said that you would be interested if I bought something like this together so I'm going to be releasing just 150 spots to my exclusive accelerated community over the coming week the only way to get access to this will be through getting on the waiting list there's going to be a link for you to sign up to it so you can head down below and sign up to the waiting list now if you want to jump on that as soon as possible section number one the AI chatbot opportunity explained in this section we're going to be doing some important groundwork in understanding and and really realizing why this trend is so big why it's such a big opportunity to get into and why you'd even consider building the skill of building AI chatbot this section is absolutely crucial background for you before you go into the later stages of this video we're essentially establishing the why for you why are you bothering to learn AI chapter development why would you even want to learn how to make these things all of that is going to be absolutely crystal clear by the end of this section well first of all if you're watching this video you probably don't need me to tell you that we are in an absolutely booming Market the AI space in general but specifically chat Bots as well so we're kind of in a super hot area of a super hot Niche already as you can see on screen the the growth rates of these markets is absolutely exploding this alone is kind of a good enough reason to be paying attention or at least trying to build skills within the area learning an essential skill within a booming market like chatbot building within AI is really a no-brainer in a lot of cases if you're looking to get into it you're looking to participate and you're looking to make money now when it comes to applications for chat Bots how they can be applied to provide real world value it's always going to come back to how businesses can use them to improve themselves with the business to treat their customers better and this is really where the main value of this new technology is going to be evident and for you as someone who's looking to learn this skill as a freelancer to start selling your services or as a business owner to start helping to grow your own business it's important to know what the benefits and the opportunities are for businesses themselves firstly chatbots open up a new Communication channel between customers and businesses which can be hugely beneficial you can sell things to them you can get insights from them as we see later here secondly there's a 24 7 availability on these chat bots so you're getting increased customer satisfaction and better service to people globally so you're not just working within maybe the eastern Time or things like this AI chatbots by Nature have sort of cost savings built into them right there they're intended to automate tasks and replace people by being artificial intelligences so they're able to make decisions they're able to handle queries without needing to pay them essentially and businesses can actually increase their revenue by using tools like AI chat Bots because it's more of a personalized shopping experience customers can or clients can get access to a personalized service or personalized upsells personalized recommendations that are just not possible with traditional chatbots or with other marketing methods really and finally in my personal favorite this kind of goes back to our first point of a new customer engagement Channel but the data that you get from the chatbots and the customer queries and information that's coming through them the transcript information offers a completely new data source to extract insights from an assistant decision making you are going to be getting so much data from these customers and you're able to analyze that data and make decisions offered on products on sort of strategic moves and things like this this is the really really exciting bit for me personally now with that background on what chatbots are why businesses would even be interested in implementing them it's important to take a bit of a closer look and really ask why is this happening what is the underlying Trend that's occurring that's making chatbots become more and more popular that's really carrying this entire thing forward the answer to this question is really the real Revolution that has been started by Ai and I think there's going to be a number of different ones but this is the first one we're experiencing right now and this is the one that we can really focus on and build skills around and make money on now and thanks to Ai and its ability to understand text and voice we are moving away from these point-and-click websites towards a world where everything we want to do on computers or with our phone Etc or on websites can be done via either typing it in and telling it what we want or by speaking to it this can be a little bit hard to grasp sometimes so I want to break it down one example of this could be that you wanted to I don't know post on Facebook about you going on holiday right now you'd have to go onto Facebook you'd have to make click click click you'd have to type in all the information you'd have to hit enter and you're going to send that and make the post similarly if you wanted to look for a house on the residential website so you could go on and make click click click I want to filter by area by number of bedrooms all of this manual input that you're having to do in order to get your results now in the future that we're moving to towards both of those things can be completely changed the way we do them really so for Facebook you could either type to your Facebook assistant and say make a post on Facebook about how I'm going holiday soon bank and it can do it all in the background for you or ideally you can do it when Apple gets their things together so sorry through a voice assistant you can just press and hold it and it says hey write me a post on Facebook for me going on holiday in the next week or can you look for houses on this site that are five bedrooms in this area and it can do it all for you but that's a little bit far off where we're going with the voice I think that will come soon but in the meantime the chat is the sort of method of input that we're going to right now thanks to the huge success of things like chat gbt people are more familiar than ever with telling a computer or instructing an AI what to do through text now the only question to ask here really is why is this happening why would consumers start to expect or even demand natural language input with their businesses they interact with rather than point-and-click websites which have proven to work and we've been using them for decades the answer to this of course is that the human brain by nature is a lazy organ our brains have developed to do the bare minimum in order to survive to conserve energy mental energy physical energy at all costs in order to be as survivable as possible right so in our modern context let's take some kind of weird shapes but in this case it is the fact of having to think about what you need to do on a website having to go in and physically click and do all these things that takes more energy than just knowing what you want and if you cut away to communicate to a computer or communicate to a website purely what you need done and you didn't have to do it yourself that would be a huge improvement over point and click to this new sort of natural language input this Revolution and how we interact with computers represents an Outsourcing of the problem solving and of the actual doing from our brains and from our bodies to the computer when we communicate our needs to our computer and tell it what to do through chat or through natural language all we have to do is think about what we want to do and communicate that and they do the rest you know longer do you have to do the problem solving of going I need to find a house of this type okay now how do I do that I need to click here and here you just tell it what you want and it does the rest that is a huge benefit and a huge improvement over having to do things manually purely because of the time and energy required but also the mental strain required to to think about how you want to execute the things you want done and it is absolutely crucial to understand this the underlying reason why this change is going to happen because now that we can work down to that and find some a valid basis it's not just AI technology hype it's real psychology it's proven to have been done over and over again our brains want an easier solution and the reason I wanted to include this in the video is because at least for me personally as someone who likes to think he's logical and evidence-based decisions understanding that there is a factual underpinning to this entire Trend especially in these kind of markets these AI hyper Cycles crypto whatever it is where it's so much hype digging down to this underlying sort of psychological principle and finding real evidence that this thing is going to to be real and it has some sort of backing is at least important for me and I thought it would be valuable for you people who are looking to become chatbot developers to get into this particular space to have this kind of thing to go back to and say yes I know that I'm I'm seeing through the hype there is something real to this and with that you can have the convection to really dive straight into something with a bit of evidence behind you and with some real conviction I thought I'd throw this in here as a pretty accurate example of the kind of future we're moving towards just to illustrate this but Iron Man's Jarvis is a great example of the future that we sort of have laying ahead of us if this technology moves in the right way so with all of that theory out of the way and we've identified that there's a big thing happening and that businesses have a lot to gain by implementing chat Bots be it through personalization leading to increased Revenue be it through reducing staff costs by automating certain tasks Etc and their customers are very soon going to be demanding these kind of options for interacting with businesses how can we latch onto the back of this trend and build businesses build skills make money and and build a life we love living off the back of this thing and so the real opportunity for us is that business owners are going to need it but they're going to have absolutely no clue how to do it there are a number of different roadblocks in the way between business owners and being able to implement this themselves some of them are on screen here so chatbots themselves can be complex you build and maintain or at least initially appear to be complex to build and maintain what I'm going to be teaching you later on in this video is going to make things crystal clear for you and making complex chat Bots is going to feel like a walk in the park secondly poorly made or bad chat Bots can actually do more harm to a business than good so there's a requirement in building these chat Bots that prevents amateurs from getting in there and thriving around their businesses so there's a level of skill required to create a chatbot that's actually going to benefit the business so again these are sort of factors that are blocking the way for a business owner to be able to do it themselves thirdly depending on your industry business owners can have all sorts of issues with data privacy and concerns so being able to be the expert and helping them understand this issue and how it applies to their chatbots and their business can be another way for you to to profit off this knowledge Gap and finally the actual integration of these chat Bots with their existing system so not just building and maintaining the chatbot itself but how it fits into all of the systems of the business can also be complex and and that's something that I'm covering a little bit in this video but also later in another video that I'm doing so you're going to have all the information you need to cover all of these points off but these are the questions that business owners have and that's what's stopping them from being able to do it yourself you are going to be the ones that bridge that for them and you have the specialized knowledge to get this thing done for them and allow them to adopt this new technology into their business so that they can make the most of the gains that they provide and I find in these kind of situations it's helpful to look back at history to see where we might be going and we have three examples of this kind of thing happening over and over again firstly websites same kind of thing new technology complex business owners don't understand it you could help them to solve it and give them specific knowledge to get them to where they want to go which is their website being able to take advantage of this new technology same thing happens with mobile apps business owners have no clue how to make a mobile app but you can help them bridge that Gap but there's benefits for them to receive on the end of it same thing with social media marketing and social media itself businesses knew that there were benefits to be had from it people came in and built a specific skill set or a specific bit of knowledge and then they were able to help businesses and get money in return for that in order to take advantage of the technology you are the knowledge Bridge bridging this gap between business owners and the kind of gains and growth they want to get out of these new technologies same thing applies for AI and chatbots and I know what you're thinking I'm not a developer I wouldn't know the first thing about helping them build a website or a mobile app or things like this I couldn't have participated in those the best thing about this current Revolution and this new technology that we have is that it's perfectly timed with the sort of massive uptick in no code platforms and no code Builders so on screen we have a bunch of no code options chat base bot Pro stack make voice flows API all of these things these are sort of the key elements of building chat Bots at least from my experience these are no code platforms that you can use to build chat Bots and this is sort of the perfect crossing over of this new technology of AI and Bot Builders with this no code Revolution so we have an opportunity as regular people without development backgrounds to take advantage of this and help to be these facilitators Bridging the Gap for business owners there is no excuse why anyone watching this couldn't learn them and couldn't start to be that person to connect businesses with the sort of Promised Land of having these chatbots built into their business they do all these things for them so with all of that what are your options well from my experience working with students and working with my community members and in my own Journey as well you really only have two routes firstly you can become a bot developer or a conversation designer in order to do this all you need to do is put aside a couple weeks or a month to really Master This Modern chatbot building and and what's called conversation design nowadays and then start to sell your services as a freelancer or even better yet get hired by a company who needs these skills as you can see on screen already this is on indeed.com one of the largest job marketplaces in the world and we're starting to see conversational AI designer AI AI chatbot developer Ai and Bot developer these things are starting to pop up with serious money behind them and we're really just starting to see the the beginning of this trend I believe so if you work on it now and you get these skills brushed up you can be working as a freelancer doing upward jobs or even just running your own freelancing business a good example of having a no code skill set becoming valuable is the example of webflow I'd say no code website builder but people become webflow experts according to Glassdoor as of February 2023 the national average salary for a webflow developer was 85 000 per year so this shows you that these no code skill sets can eventually become valuable and you can start to make a lot of money as a freelancer or as an employee and this was no code for websites now imagine this but combined with the hottest Market in the world right now and something that is really driving a ton of new and exciting value for businesses I'd be very surprised to see these kind of prices if not more as the sort of basic rate for these developers and these bot developers moving forward now option number two is to create your own business that sells AI chatbots and other sort of AR related services to other businesses and this is what I've called the AI automation agency or AAA as I mentioned in the intro as an AI automation agency you can create powerful AI chat Bots and sell them to other businesses but you can also stack additional value on top of your chat Bots by adding additional automations that integrate these chat Bots into the businesses so it's no longer just a little isolated chat but that does one function it is a a key part of a business imagine a lead generation chat bot that is now bringing you business in and you're sending that information off to other parts of the business you're analyzing it you're doing follow-ups and things like this so the goal is to package up a bunch of different automation so maybe it's a chatbot with a couple different automation deliverables on the back of it and then you're going to package it up and sell it to a niche you can create a package for a specific industry maybe a chat bot with a couple things built off the back of it you can say that I have an AI automation package for real estate agents and then you focus on that Niche and you're able to sell this package to as many real estate agents as possible so this is more of the business side of things I think for Lancing is both great a great way to get your feet wet and to build up a bit of experience and then once you've seen enough of the different industries that are working and the really exciting ones you want to work with then you can start your own AI automation agency focus on that Niche and create like a really awesome package that provides real value for the business and then start to sort of mass distribute that package to people within that Niche the AI automation agency model is something I created in order to provide the best on-ramp for entrepreneurs into AI because I always sort of struggle to find a way that I could recommend to a friend and say hey this is how you can start an AI this is how you can start to make money the state can start to make a business so I've built it sort of around initially at least around no Code and low code tools so that it's much more accessible and this is the kind of stuff I'm going to be teaching you later in the video the exact chatbots that we're going to be building are the ones that I sell in my AI automation agency over at Morningside and you're going to be able to take them and start to sell them to clients Etc so I'm giving you all the information you need to to start doing the same things that I am and on screen you can see the kind of transition that I really want the AI automation agency model too so tight which is transitioning from an AI spectator and someone who's just looking at watching videos and trying to keep up with the news to someone who's an actual active participant and you're running a business you're speaking to clients you're actively doing things and this is how I've learned so much in the past sort of year year and a half is by actually doing it every day and spectating you're only going to get so far so that's why I've created the model to be as beginner friendly as possible at least initially to use these low Code and low code tools so that you can become an active participant and really accelerate your learning and see above the crowd which is really in a position that I am as well and it's really great because you see the opportunities a mile away and you can make much more calculated decisions and you're ready for those opportunities when they come and as I said earlier selling these low code and no code chat Bots to my clients makes up a significant portion of the 120 000 in Revenue we're doing monthly at the moment I don't want to jump the gun and spend too much time on this now so I'm going to be giving you a lot more information on this model and on how you can get into it at the end of the video where I cover how you can sell chat lots to businesses but if you absolutely we cannot wait and you really want to know more about this right now I do have a two hour long beginner's guide on how you can start an AI automation agency step by step with what nearly 200 000 views on that and the reception has been fantastic so if you want to jump over it's going to be up here but be sure to come back and watch this because this is sort of the foundation on how you can actually deliver the services and this is part of the reason they're making this is because so many people in my community were like man I just need a really good tutorial on how to build chat bots in the first place and finally we're in section number two we're going to be covering the different types of chat Bots now this is important to understand because sorting out all of the different types is probably thousands of different ways you can build them at this point being able to sort them out and at least cluster them into sort of rough groups is important for you moving forward to know what to apply to what situation and what client might need what and what particular type of chatbot is good for which situation now the different types of chatbots that I'm going to cover within this video which covers basically as much as you need to know we have old school chat Bots we have pure AI chat Bots and then we have what I call Modern chatbots now the first type is old school chat what these things have been around forever they're largely based on decision trees as you can see on the side here sort of like if then if this happens into this if the user says this or if the user presses this button Etc these typically require strict matches and you may have even encountered these on some websites over the past couple of years where you would ask something and it would just have no clue what you're talking about and it's like how does this thing not understand it's because it's probably based on strict matching mean you have to say a specific set of words in order to get a specific outcome so in a lot of cases these are going to prefer to have binary choices giving you would you like to do this or that rather than saying what would you like help with and letting you answer in free form and sort of open-ended conversation and I call them old school because they have literally been around for forever really all the way back to 1966 was the first chatbot called Eliza it's like a psychotherapist a project someone did at University well this thing had was hundreds or probably even thousands of responses and then when the user sent a question and it had to sort of match up the question with one of the existing responses as best it could so we're here to put thousands and thousands of different responses in this thing and it was all F basically if he didn't put it into the chatbot originally it's not going to be able to to create it so having to match up inputs and outputs is a sort of black and white day and night contrast to what I call Pure AI chat Bots and these are basically chat GPT how you're familiar with using chat CPT is the most basic example of a pure AI chatbot you can imagine if your AI chatbots are completely freeform conversation you could chat to it all day you can ask it any question anything you want in the world and it's going to come back intelligently from that these things run on your endless loop as I said they're just going to go on and on and on as a complete opposite of old school where you have to have it sort of baked into it and match the inputs and outputs up with these pure AI chat Bots they've kind of done all the baking for you these large language models have so much data it's had hundreds of millions of different sentences and phrases already baked into that so that you don't have to do it yourself when you ask it a question it's able to just intelligently guess the next token until you've got an answer so you guys are probably very very familiar with chbt I don't think there's much explanation needed for this but in the case of when we're using it in our own applications and chatbots we build or on other apps we're going to be running on a large language model API so in this case a lot of the chatbot Builders are using the chat GPT API or the gpt4 API essentially this allows us to use the functionality of chat GPT or gpt4 within our own application so it's basically like calling them up and saying hey I'm going to send you my message can you send it back can you do that programmatically rather than within the chat GPT interface itself now for our purposes I categorize pure AI chat Bots into two distinct types we have firstly prompted assistance and then we also have custom knowledge chatbots now prompted assistants are very basic they're very easy to do you guys have probably even done them within chat GPT yourself essentially all you're doing is combining a large language model and a prompt so here you can see I've got instructions.txt whenever you see this just know that I'm talking about prompt so it's instructions to the model and what I want it to do in this case we're combining a large language model with a prompt telling it what to do how to behave you're setting it into a mode or a character and it's going to use only the knowledge that's already been baked into the large language model so the easiest way for you to understand what these things are is think back to when you're using chat GPT yourself I'm sure there's been many times where you've given it instructions you are a desk listeners I want you to do this this and this only respond with this this and this in the same way that you are prompting chat gbt to get to do a specific thing personally a prompted assistant is just sort of the the external version of that we are doing the exact same thing but with an API to do it instead so we provide instructions within our chatbot application saying one example maybe you are a python tutor you are going to teach me how to Learn Python you are going to give me instructions to do this unless you're going to give me tests those are instructions that I can give to my chat GPT API and I prompt it into this role and then I can have this interaction with a chat bot that's been prompted into this role now the key thing to know here is that it's using the baked in knowledge of that so you can use any of the knowledge that chat gbt knows and use it off that and have fairly useful and interesting prompted assistant but it's limited and that the information is only going to be kept at the information that was trained in the model in the first place and the last Point here is that they can be helpful but they're never really going to be hugely valuable because it's all so freely accessible anything that you do with a prompted assistant can be replicated basically instantly by someone giving it the same instructions so there's no real source that you're adding on top of it you're just giving it a bit of instruction so it can be helpful but in terms of selling it and creating a valuable chat bot for a business especially it's not going to be hugely valuable next we have custom knowledge chat Bots which I'm sure you're familiar with this is the same as a prompted assistant but you have the added element of a knowledge base so it's a large language model API we're going to cover apis soon so don't worry about that we have a prompt as well for some instructions on what this AI is supposed to do and then we have it connected to a knowledge base of maybe a business's business data so we might have your spreadsheet put in there or you might have some instructions you might have a customer service document you're creating a custom knowledge chat bot that has access to some interesting data can be very very valuable and there's thousands of use cases really for it not just for the businesses within your personal life there's so many different things you can do with the customized chatbot knowing how these work and how to build them is such a valuable skill so I'm going to be covering it a time we're going to be doing five or six different examples of customized chat Bots later in the video so stick around for that because they are very very easy to make when you know how to do them the way I do them but there are so many different applications and once you have that knowledge you can really provide value to a business in so many different ways now the final Point I've got here is that they are not as simple as you think I see so many wrong things being said about the myths and misconceptions that I'm going to clear up in this video give you the full under the hood look and understanding of the key Concepts and how these things actually work and that's going to put you head and shoulders above everyone else in this market if you actually know how these things work because when things go wrong you're going to be able to debug them and figure it out so all of that later in the video I I really can't wait to say about that that's my my favorite stuff really some examples of custom knowledge chat Bots are basically customer support chat Bots you have basic AI Persona chatbots that I talk a lot about on this channel I get basic lead generation chat Bots and basic staff training chatbots now I say basic because modern chatbots which I'm covering next are sort of the advanced versions which have a lot more features we're going to be building a bunch of basic chat Bots later in the video but then also building some Advanced ones so I thought I'd make it clear the difference between the basic and the advanced ones and the sort of category that they fit into now the final kind of chatbot and the one we're really going to be focusing on learning how to build later in the video is of course modern chat Bots this is a term or a definition that I've given to a specific type of chat Bots that use a lot of the modern stuff that we are seeing in the space right now and it typically combines what we've gone over as the old school chat Bots with elements of AIS with the same kind of structure and the way you can lay out a old school style chat but also by adding in a ton of AI features and using AI technology to enhance it it becomes this really flexible and and Powerful type of chat bot and as I just said these chat Bots are able to do specific functions or have different features built into them this can perform external actions like pushing and pulling data to a database or calling an API and retrieving some information or sending some away so you can do a lot more functionality and they get out of this little box that these uh pure AI chat Bots are typically stuck in and because of the points I've just mentioned these chat Bots can be extremely valuable to a business and I've got some examples here on screen of advanced chatbots that you can build you may notice that these are exactly the same as the custom knowledge base chat Bots that we've just gone over the point is that those were basic these are advanced in that you can add a ton more features into it to do a lot more to connect to parts of the business so anything that you can do with a custom mold chat bot you can basically upgrade and make a ton more valuable and Powerful by using the modern chatbot creation methods now that you've got a clear idea of the different kinds of chat Bots that you can work with and you can create that's important to now jump into the kind of softwares that are going to allow you to build these things as easily as possible and and sort of give you as much depth as you need to build the features you want so I've worked with a lot of softwares I do this on the daily I am building chatbots I'm helping my team build chat plus I'm working with students building chatbots so I've really tested out everything and so for my trial and era I've compiled this list of softwares that you can at least start with feel free to explore your own but the ones I'm going to be covering in this I've used myself and I actually enjoy using it and I was happy enough to share them with you guys in this video as starting points at least so when it comes to chatbot building I've divided these softwares into three distinct Parts firstly we have prototyping secondly we have what I'm calling complete Builders so these are bot building platforms and then thirdly we have tools which are extra bits and Bobs that can help enhance the functionality of your existing chatbot to start off with we have prototyping softwares now there's a ton of different ones you can use for this these three on screen are the ones I typically like to play around with I think there's little differences between each of them that allow you to use it for different use cases and I feel like at least from my experience having these three in your pocket at least being familiar with them is very handy for working with clients spitting up prototypes Etc so we have chat based Dante Ai and Cody AI we're going to be covering these later in the video I'll show you how to whip up a quick prototype chat bot and why you might want to do that as well well typing I mean a kind of chatbot that allows you to quickly spin something up it's good for quick demos as I say here on screen you can shoot a little loom video if you're using it to send to clients potential clients and get them warmed up in the idea of a chat bot you can very very easily take some custom data put it into these platforms and spin up a prototype this can be very very good for proof of Concepts similar to demos but proving that say you're working with a client this particular set of data I can actually make work within one of these prototyping platforms so you can quickly grab it spin it up and prove to your client proof to yourself and the client as well that this kind of outcome is possible even using these basic prototyping platforms so if you can do it with one of these it's very very likely that you can do it and better when you take it over to a complete bot Builder and the reason these are prototyping softwares are not fully fledged at chatbot Builders is that there's typically limited customization on them you can change the styling you can play around with the prompting and things like this but there's a sort of hard and upper limit on how much customization you can do and that really restricts a lot of the chat Bots you can build here too through that pure AI kind of type right so you can't get it to these modern chat Bots with a ton of cool functionality ability to call different things so very much contained within a box but still very very useful in in many use cases as well and the key Point here and why I've even mentioned them at all is that these can be very very valuable to quickly spun up a demo show it to a client get some interest at least prove it to them that it can work as you'll find I've found and my students find as well there's so much skepticism about this technology sometimes you need to have a very very low and very low risk offer for a client in order to get them to see the value in it so rather than expecting them to pay you five six seven whatever thousand dollars for a complete modern chatbot build that's plugged into all of their business you can spin them up a prototype for one of these things give it away for free or a very low amount of money and then once I see the value you can upsell them on the full package that's going to do a ton more and provide a ton more value so each of these softwares are very similar in how they work for chat based you can upload a website URL and take a selected number of pages off a website URL and create sharp one out of that you can also upload documents and it's going to create a custom modes chat bot that you can talk to and deploy Etc very similar with Dante AI only it also has a YouTube video data loader so you can put a whole bunch of my YouTube videos in and start to have a customer check what you can chat to there and similarly Kodi AI I put this one in here because it has a cool feature where you can select folders and as you see here we have a website and documents as data to load but then you can also build in folders and then select what folder your custom launch chatbot is going to use so it might sound a little bit complicated but I'll show it later in the video of how we can use this and there's some specific use cases that this can be very very useful for at least when prototyping then we have what I call complete bot Builders we have bot press and voice flow if you've watched my channel much before you know I've used bot press extensively at least I've been using it but recently as well as over these two options here they have fairly similar features as you can see here they've got a very similar sort of canvas layout where you can plot out the nodes you can connect them up and you can run all your custom functionality and this is really key because it allows you to build anything you want so anything you can imagine you can basically find find a way to build it on these platforms giving you huge amount of flexibility and sort of creative freedom and control so they can build anything from Ultra basic chat Bots all the way to some of the most complex ones you could possibly find in the market right now one of the key differences as I mentioned before between this and the prototyping ones is that you have ability to perform actions and really make your chatbot not just sitting in a little bubble but allowed to do things outside like connect to the business database or to call apis and things like this so you can read and write the databases you can make API calls and then another hugely important part is the easy deployment to Major channels so these winning platforms allow you to send the chatbot onto a web chat so put it in a little bubble down the corner you can also deploy it to Whatsapp you can also deploy it to SMS and things like this so plenty of easy deployment and deployment can actually be very difficult if you were doing this manually but using these bot Builders and these tools and these platforms allow you to quickly sort of couple different clicks and then you're able to get it sent out onto a cool new way for customers and people to interact with your Bots then finally we have the Third category which I'm calling tools and this includes things like automation platforms such as zapier and make but also things like stack AI which I've used heavily on the channel before to build really custom functionality so if I build some cool custom AI functionality that I can't necessarily get done within with a voice flow or the bot press I can create it in something like stack AI I do a really really cool AI application and then I can connect that application and the functionality that I've created to my bot and it can just when I get to a particular part in the bot build or they're in the conversation they hit a trigger and they can call that app I can pass some data to stack AI manipulate it do whatever I want with it then pull all this really valuable response back and really expand outside the functionality provided by bot press and voice flow on the automation slab with zapier and make we're going to be covering later in the video as well basically these are very very powerful platforms that's going to allow you to integrate the chat bot with the rest of the business and basically do a whole bunch of cool functions again extending the functionality of the chatbot Beyond just this little bubble that it works in but being able to pull data from it and do things with it and Trigger events within the business like capture leads and do all sorts of stuff trigger email and SMS flows all that really really fun stuff which I love doing I'm going to be covering later in the video as well so we have a lot to get to when it comes to key Concepts today we're going to be talking about knowledge bases first and foremost which is hugely important to understand and the real complexities and what's going on behind the scenes with them then we have a brief touch on fine tuning then we get into prompting which is a hugely important aspect of chatbot building and tent classification chat history and deployment we're going to go through each of these right now and be sure to have your notebook ready because there's a lot of information to take in without further Ado let's get stuck into knowledge bases just to be clear when I say knowledge base I'm referring to the element of the custom knowledge chatbot that we were mentioning earlier in the video it is a key element in creating a custom mod chat bot and knowledge basis where the knowledge is stored really so a knowledge base is a database of text and numeric data chunks stored by similarity a chatbot can retrieve a small amount of information most similar to the a query from that database then only this info that was retrieved from the database is then passed to a model such as the chat CPT API to help it generate an answer to their question now not all of the info from the database is going to be used just the chunks that were retrieved that's about as simple as I could get it to make it fit on the screen and we're now going to spend a couple slides just really breaking that down the appearance first reality when it comes to knowledge basis is really important to understand initially and that with a correctly set up knowledge base is and you've done all the work and you've managed your parameters correctly you can create a chat bot that appears to know all of the information that you've given it to know but in reality this is not true it does not know all of the information and here's why the issue that we run into when you're trying to make a chatbot know all of the information or an AI in general a large language model is that we've run into the similarly age-old issue now of language models is that you hit the token limit we have this token limit pane as you may know chat gbt when you're using it personally has token limits is you've given too much the message is too long you need to reduce it and try again it's the same thing when you're using these models programmatically when you're calling the apis there is a fixed limit on the information that we can provide them with in terms of how many tokens so here on site you can see GPT 3.5 turbo which runs chat CPT there's a limit of 4 000 tokens and this includes not only the message you send but the information you get back so if I send 3 000 tokens and it tries to send back 1500 tokens it doesn't work it's over the limit and because of these token limits it is impossible I mean it's possible if you have a very small knowledge base but if you have a large knowledge base with like an entire encyclopedia inside it it is impossible because of the token limit for the AI test look at all the data and really see it all because you can't put the entire book and it can only understand what's in the four thousand or eight thousand tokens that we send away to it so it's impossible for it to look at everything because it's more than 8 000 tokens and so in order to get around this token limit the issue we need to set up a retrieval system to get the most relevant info to answer our user query and only that we only have 4 000 tokens if we're going to answer users question we better make sure that the information that we are putting in those 4000 tokens is the most relevant to what the users asked this is the key to understanding this whole thing and so how do we set up a system that can retrieve the right information to answer the specific user question well the first step is what's called chunking and that is basically say again using the encyclopedia example I put an encyclopedia into my knowledge base what I'm going to do what the system is then going to do sorry is chunk it into into sets of text using the encyclopedia example again say I take my encyclopedia and I put it through our system what it's going to do is take that entire book or the entire sort of thousand thousands of pages that you scroll through on your computer and it's just going to chop it into what are called chunks now these chunks can vary in size and you can play around with the different sizes of them and how much they overlap and things like this but to keep it simple imagine we're chopping them into chunks of text this big maybe so we've got one chunk two chunk maybe three chunks per page or something like that and then once we've chunked encyclopedia into thousands of chunks of this size we're going to take all of those chunks and put them into what's called a vector database I don't want to get too technical but on screen is an image that kind of allows you to understand how the effective databases work it's not a normal database and how you have like a row like a spreadsheet and things like this it's more of like a box and you can store the information all of your chunks go into the vector database and they're stored by this similarity of the meaning so there's a using the bidding script that's going to essentially identify what the the chunk is about so every chunk we're going to put it through this what's called an embedding model don't worry about that it's a bit too technical but we put it through the embedding model and then it's going to basically tell us what this is about and then when you put it into the vector space it's going to sort everything by what's semantically similar to each other so on screen you can see here we've got things like barrels and BPD barrels of BPD have been put close together and the closer they are the more similar the meaning is and as you can see here we also have oil producers in China and things like this it's all about encyclopedia are going to be put into our database and all sort of assembled when they're closer to each other if they're more similar so one on an elephant might be right next to a rhinoceros and so on so and then something about cars and motorbikes might be in a completely different area but nearby as well it's important to understand this that they are stored by their similarity they're clustered and they're close to chunks that are most similar to what their content contains firstly you'll recognize our Vector database is up here this is filled with all of our information so it starts over here on the right with a user query so say I'm using our encyclopedia custom knowledge base and I say how much does an elephant weigh it's going to take my user query it's going to run it to the vector database and it's going to basically have some instructions imagine as someone who's operating the Victor database and they read how much does an elephant weigh and it has coordinates of where the elephant would be and he goes reaches into this box and grabs okay elephant is over here I'm going to grab anything around there so it will pull back maybe five chunks from our encyclopedia that are closest to where elephant should be in in the Vic database so we pull that back out now we have five chunks that are highly similar to what we've asked so it might be an elephant or an ostrich a giraffe anything that's kind of similar to what we've asked about it's going to pull those information chunks back and then we have what we're called the most relevant chunks here on the side then we have the final crucial step of actually generating an answer based off this information so here we can see we take the most relevant chunks and we pass them over to what I'm saying is an AI plus a prompt and we're also going to be passing this AI plus a prompt the user query that we said originally so how much does an elephant weigh is our original query we're going to ask a bigger database for anything related to that we've got the most relevant chunks back regarding elephants and how much they weigh and we're passing that to the AI but we're also passing us the original question so the AI as you'll see in the next slide is going to know one what we're asked after and it's going to have these five chunks of information that should be able to help but answer the question so this in particular deserves a little bit more investigation so we can take this to the next slide now there's some code on the screen here don't freak out you don't need to understand stand what's happening here but basically when you're actually making calls and you're using these apis and you're talking to the chat GPT API programmatically you have what's called a system message you may be familiar with this already from the playground but essentially this top line is called the system message and that's the instructions you give to the entire chat experience so all the messages that come after are going to be constructed based on what the system message is so in the playground you may be familiar with it on the side panel you have your system message so in this case it says you are a helpful assistant we could say you are crusty the clown speaker across you the clown and make jokes and then whenever we send a message here on the user side of things which lines up with these also by the way it's going to take into account the system message and then it's going to answer and give us a response so that's what I mean by a prompted AI what we have is basically we need to give instructions to the AI on how to use the information we've just got back so you almost got the information about the the elephant but we need to now generate an answer using the AI So the instructions that we give in the prompt to this AI is going to directly determine the until we get back so if I tell this thing and our system prompt to deal with this elephant question you are crusty the clown make jokes and answer questions that the user asks it will eventually give us the answer to our question but the instructions told it to speaker across to the cloud so that's why this prompt and really the instructions you're giving to the AI on how to deal with this information is so key and it's one of the major and most important parts in the whole custom knowledge based chatbot system or at least using a knowledge base so also here it's important to note is how these actually come together so yes I said we are passing the user query we are also getting the chunks from the vector database but when it comes to actually sending it off we are inserting the chunks that we receive say this chunks bit is replaced with five of those third of a page chunks we've got and also the user queries so we can tell the AI that you were going to be given chunks of information that may be relevant to what the user is asking and we're going to provide it in the prompt so then when we pass the chunks in let me also pass to use Aquarian it's like okay I need to answer the user query with this information up and given and you can tell it in the prompt to be strictly using the information that came back there's a lot of different things you can do here but it's really important to understand that this AI plus prompt is really the magic step of combining what we've retrieved from the vector database aka the the most relevant information to what the user is asking with combining it with the user query and then asking the AI to generate us an answer going back to our full system here once it's generated the answer it sends it back to us as the response that we see appear in the chatbot so I hope I've been able to communicate that as clearly as possible it's really important to understand that the answer is actually being generated based off the information so it's only going to have the information that we got from the knowledge base you can't that's what I'm saying we only have this 4 000 token limit we don't have the entire 10 000 or 100 000 tokens in the encyclopedia we can only work with the information we have and this is a common misconception about knowledge basis is that oh you just throw it in there and it's going to know the whole thing know what it's doing is intelligently retrieving the information so that it's able to look like it knows the information really all it knows is the most relevant info from your knowledge base for regarding this specific question so I thought I'd throw in an analogy just to help you understand this a little bit more so you are going on to Google and you're doing a Google search so yeah you search up how much does an elephant weigh so the Google search that you may do how much does an elephant weigh goes to Google search algorithm and it Returns the most relevant results first so you get the first page results of Google and somewhere in there is going to be the answer to your question right and then what they do is instead of passing it to an AI to dig through and check we just pass it to you the human to dig through and you know what the question you were originally thinking of is now you just have to pick through all of the information and find a bit that gives you the answer in the exact same way we have the system set up where the AI is given the most relevant search results from the vector database and then it's given the original query okay what were we actually looking for in the first place and then it figures it out looks all the different chunks it's given and then gives you the response that's the best analogy I could come up with I hope that's made something click in your head now for those of you who want to go extra deep I'll just put this on screen for a second here let's stay a little bit more in depth as they how things go I don't expect you to understand this but this is a system known as a retriever generator model so we're retrieving the information and we're generating the answer you can pause on screen and just take a look at this this is missing a couple steps but if you want to know how this really happens step by step you can pause it take these notes but this is really what's happening under the hood with a custom knowledge base and as I said earlier there are some common myths and misconceptions that I must debunk in this video just for the sake of my own sanity from hearing it all the time but also for you as someone who's soon going to be speaking to businesses and speaking to potential clients if you're going to start selling these you need to know this because you could sound like a real idiot if you say it in the wrong way so number one you are not training a model there is no training being done training a model costs millions and millions of dollars and huge ridiculous amounts of computing power people like you and I do not have the means to train models unless it's some small maybe with a big rig that your friend has I don't know it's basically not on the cards for any of us so training a model we leave to the big multi-billion dollar companies to use their resources and train models with new data and that really bakes in and information into the model you are also not fine-tuning the model A lot of people use this term you are not fine-tuning a model when you have a knowledge base all you're doing is making the right information accessible to the model to use and answering its question and sort of an intelligent and flexible system I think the terminology of fine tuning can be a little bit of a gotcha because in many ways when you're working with these kind of chatbots you can go to the client and say okay I'm going to fine-tune the responses a bit but that doesn't mean you're actually fine-tuning the model by by its actual definition it could mean just going back to the drawing board and tweaking The Prompt a little bit and how the instructions you've given on how to generate the answer you're going to change those instructions a little bit and fine tune it in that way to to really get the exact kind of outputs that your client wants and finally you are not teaching the model anything it's not learning you literally just putting the right information in front of it to answer the question at the current time and then it goes back to being just as dumb as it was before so it's you're not teaching you're not fine-tuning you're not training I thought I'd just get that cleared up right now I will give a pass to my one situation in which you can utter these words and that is when you are talking to a client who is clearly not Technical and he or she may struggle to grasp the real Concepts that I've just taken you through now and explaining that to them is probably going to do more harm than good it does sound better and it is easier for them to understand if you say we're going to train a chat bot on your data and and that's that's the only time you can probably use it but I will just be very careful that you don't say it to the wrong person because they'll look at you is pretty stupid if you say that before we wrap up the section I thought I'd throw one more analogy your way and that's to help you understand these knowledge bases and how the difference between chat Bots learning and you just giving them the right information at the right time is imagine if you were to ask me a question about anything we've just gone over in this video I would be able to give you an answer in a second because I know the information that's already in my head but if you ask me a question about your business's customer support documents I wouldn't know how to answer but unless you gave me the document so what I'd ask you for is hey can you give me some pages or some documents that are most relevant to answering this question you have about your customer support you can give me the five documents and I can go okay that but there that but they're okay yeah I know the answer the answer is this that is the simplest way that I can explain the system you're giving the AI a couple documents to answer the question that's checking over all of the information and it's going okay this is the answer the next key concept we have to cover is fine tuning are we going to blast through this one pretty quick but basically long story short chat models aka the open AI API models that we use for basically everything in chatbot building at the moment they cannot be fine-tuned it is coming soon they say they're working on it later in the year in 2023 and the ones that you could fine-tune the older models which you were able to find tune that weren't these chat models are actually being depreciated so you can't fine tune the old ones and you can't fine-tune the new ones so fine tuning is basically off the cards if you want a little bit of technical on how these fine tunes actually work it's narrowing down a model to a very very specific use case so for chatbots this is basically useless you're teaching it to identify a pattern and then respond to that in a specific way for example you can fine tune a language model to identify a bunch of information scraped off a credit card statement and teach it to only identify alcohol expenses if you gave it enough examples of the information and then the output you wanted you could fine tune it to be able to instantly pluck out alcohol expenses or something like that so it's very very small use case and again an important point to mention when it comes to fine-tuning you are not adding new data to the model what you were doing is teaching it to identify a pattern and respond to that pattern in a specific way it's pattern recognition and pattern responding really basically forget fine tuning it's barely used anymore and it's not really relevant for anything you're going to be doing in sharper body next we have prompting which in its most simple definition is giving instructions to the AI on what it should do so in our case for chat by building we're typically prompting the AI into acting a certain way or being a certain role or maybe you give it a name you say your name is Dave and you do things for this business and this is how you do things and this is basically the instructions you want to tell the AI on how we want to process our information how we want to respond to users what things to do what things not to do now prompting itself is a huge huge topic and I've actually done two complete videos on this which are long enough in their own right so I'm going to link them here if you guys want to check them out it's going to be up here it'll also be in the description I can't cover it within this video because there's seriously so much groundwork you need to I know but trust me these videos that I've got cover it from basically zero all the way to very very Advanced and if you're able to watch that after this and then apply that to the chatbot building you do you're going to be in a very very good position so everything I know and use on a daily basis is in here and then you're also able to use the prom templates and and the actual prompts I'm giving away later in this video alongside the chatbots we build so with this knowledge and then having access to the templates that that I provide and we find in my community and you're going to have all the prompting expertise that you need so definitely check these out next but just know for now that prompting is giving a set of instructions to the AI in the same way you'd give a human employee a list of instructions this is what you to do in your job so that's about it for property next key concept is called intent classification and this is a huge huge thing that you need to understand in terms of modern chatbot building so intent classification is defined as the task of taking a written or spoken input and classifying it based on what the user wants to achieve now this is best explained with a diagram so here on the left we have a chat bot let's say for these purposes it's a e-commerce customer support chat bot so as soon as the user sends a message it's going to send it directly to the intent classifier function now this can be typically done with on the bot building platforms like voice flow and Bot press it's going to classify or attempt to classify what the user is asking for and then if there's something that's been set up on how to deal with that specific attempt it's going to Route the query that way and then kick off a bunch of functions so basically if they mention something specific that falls into a category we can do a special thing so this is great for keeping the chat open and basically allowing people to send whatever they want instead of giving them options so you can either give them buttons and say I would like to do this I would like to do this or you can just say hey how can I help you and we're going to figure out what you want using our AI system so for the e-commerce store example we could have action one here action two and action three I've actually got it here and 10 classification example say we have a message coming from the user so first the chatbot asks hey how can I help you today leaves the floor open and then when the user sends a message we're going to run it through the intent classifier we have a couple different intents set up so firstly they've mentioned something about shipping like Hey where's my package or I don't can you update me on the shipping in that case if it fits that bill it fits the intent of wanting to know more about their order or whether you're tracking or what the status of tracking is then we're going to send it to this one here and then it's going to kick off a bunch of functions where we actually check that information for them so in this case it will go up and ask for the order number capture the order number check the system and then give them the answer furthermore if if the question that they sent was like Hey I've really enjoyed my products it'll arrived just on time I just wanted to say thank you I mean no one's really going to say that but if someone did send that to a chat what sort of spontaneous obviously we can have an intense setup that is I've enjoyed my product I'm really happy with the product shipping was fast anything related to that kind of message we can say okay we want to identify that and do a specific thing and in this case the chatbot could respond by saying hey I'm glad you liked your product and you go like that shopping experience would you be interested in leaving a review so this is two examples of being able to catch something that the user has said while still leaving the floor open but we can sort of pluck out specific things that we're looking for and then if that thing is in the message then do this and it allows these AI chat Bots this is how you go from a pure AI chatbot to more of a modern one where you're able to open the floor and let them talk and ask general questions but we can pluck things out and do things uh that that sort of pure AI chatbots card and the key thing here is that you can set up a default where you may just have a knowledge base on General customer support FAQs and if none of your intents are triggered say there's nothing related to shipping there's nothing related to how much you love the product so it's not going to be route to these specific functions we've set up we might have two we might have 10 we might have 20. if none of them are triggered then we can just send it to a regular knowledge base with our customer support where we say we've prompted our AI into thinking that it's a customer support agent and it's just supposed to respond to bigquery so if the customer asks for anything outside of what we have built into our intent classifier we can just send that to a custom odd chatbot and answer the question for them normally I want you right now to just to really dial in the understanding of this concept is think of some kind of chat bot maybe it's a customer support chatbot like this or it's a staff training chat bot or it's uh whatever kind of chat but you can imagine in order to really drive this concept home I want you to take your PIN right now on your notebook and sketch out the sort of diagram here and pick an example of a chat bot for example a staff training chat bot for a construction company which has all of their staff trading documents included in it what we want to imagine is if we have a couple different features so say a staff training chart but what features might they want in the okay they might want something where the staff could request time off or they could report an incident on site or they could this and then look at that so take your idea and plan out what kind of features would actually be cool uh within a chatbot for us to be able to do actions for the business and and sort of set it up and connect it to some external things and actually do something else on just the chatbot Now intent classification makes up a major part of what we do with the advanced chat Bots later in this video I can't wait to show you guys those really really interesting similar examples to this but you get to sort of see it in action as well so just a recap intent classification is a very very powerful tool for Chapel developers currently it uses AI to analyze what the users ask for and from their trigger different actions to allow it to do external functions or do additional features and this of course as I just mentioned is a key component in modern chatbot building next we have chat history which within chatbot building can be a quite a difficult subject or quite a difficult thing to get to work properly within your application so I wanted to touch on it here and just give you a little bit of a background on how it actually works when you're doing a different chatbot applications basically what the system for handling and remembering context within the chat is so as we went over and the knowledge base section we only have a limited amount of tokens to work with and at any given time your the model that you're using for your chatbot underneath can only look at 4 000 tokens or 8 000 tokens or 16 000 depending on which one you're using so in order for it to know about the chat history context we need to be giving the chat history to the AI including it in the prompt that we send away on screen we have a little bit of an edited example of what you just saw earlier which is the same prompt that AI concept where we're giving the AI a prompt we're telling it what to do but then we're also retrieving the most relevant chunks but in this case we're also adding in a section for the recent messages this is a way we can include some recent chat history as context in order to help it make its output so in this case you could prompt the AI and the system prompt up here and include it this is going to be a lot longer than it is here I obviously don't have room to fit it all in but within that system prompt you could say you are also going to be provided with some reset chat history use the messages provided to be aware of the recent chat history and factor that into your answers so basically instructing it you're going to be given chunks which is going to give you the context for how to actually answer the question the information that you need then you're also going to be given a a section of chat history which is going to give you a bit of context in order to properly answer the user's question given the the past messages as well now given all of this information answer the user's query at the bottom here so a little bit of a clear way of showing this is to put it right here so imagine each time that we actually send a message off to the AI say we see the message on our chat bot every time we ask something this is essentially the the stack that's being put together before you send it away to to the llm to create the answer so we have firstly the system prompt which is going to be our instructions at you are Dave from Jerry's gym or whatever it is as we said that's going to include the sort of UI to use the information provided in the context to create an answer be aware of the chat history provided you should not do this you should do this Etc that's a little bit at the top then we can add in the most relevant chunks from our Vector database for my knowledge base being put in there as context to help provide information to answer it with then we can add in a section of recent chat history and then finally we can add in the user query and then we bundle that all up and then we send that away to the in this case probably the chat GPT API in order to get that responder to and we send that back to the user as the final result so this is kind of chat history knowledge bases prompting everything built into one here on the screen so I hope this makes sense because this is kind of the The Ice Cream okay on how things are really being assembled behind the scenes every time a user sends a message next key concept you need to understand is deployment now this is a quick one I just wanted to make sure everyone's on the same page because I will be using the term quite a lot we have deployments is how you're going to get your chatbot out how is it going to be exposed to customers how are people actually going to use it now it's all good and fine and dandy to build these chat Bots Within These bot Builders as we're going to do later but when it comes to actually providing value to a customer it's very very important where is this thing even going to be is it accessible enough are people going to be able to use it so we have a couple of different deployments on screen web chat of course is a very very popular one you can create a chatbot on these platforms and then put it as a little bubble in the bottom right corner and people can access it you can put it on specific pages of the website or you can put it on every page of the website or you can even take these shop lights all of the time and put it in a sort of full page chatbot example and still put it on the website then we have WhatsApp which is very very useful very very simple deployment and works very well for some Industries and not so well for others some Industries are very very prone to using WhatsApp and if you can deploy something there it's very very basic it seems basic but you can build a lot of cool functionality into it then we also have Facebook Messenger so you can deploy to Facebook Messenger and you can also run lead you can run Facebook ads to this messenger so it really ties into a completely different side of the chatbot realm when you can actually run ads these chat Bots and starts to lead generation and things like this and then finally you can use twilio for SMS and and be able to chat with these chatbots Via SMS as well so this is really just scratching the surface you can do Discord slack all these different things basically anything you can imagine you can deploy to but these are kind of the main ones you'll be looking at a lot of the time now the key concept section would not be complete without covering a little bit more of the jargon first off we have apis apis is an acronym for application programming interface a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other so that's obviously the technical explanation for it now in order to understand apis which are a huge part of chatbot building you're going to be calling apis within your chatbots to perform external functions to connect your chatbot to outside data sources and to go to zapier and make and things like this so it is absolutely crucial that you understand how these work because you are going to be building them and this is about as Technical and as Cody as as you're going to need to to know because you're actually going to be using these pretty regularly within your chat bots so in order to understand apis you have to understand how the web works really which is by requests and responses now when you run up a web page say you search up google.com what you're doing is sending a request to Google server and what they're doing is sending the information for that web page back to you and now that's loading on your screen as a web page now that doesn't necessarily need to be an entire web page the URL in your browser is not just for finding websites that's also kind of like a phone so you can make contact to different available resources on the internet so when you type in a specific address you're basically sending a request through that address with hey I want to get some information from you and it can send it back if it's a valid URL and if you've provided the right information for it so the way I can explain requests and responses in this case is that say you are sitting at home and you want to order some pizza you need to First find a pizza shop and you need to find the phone number now their phone number is exposed to the world that they can call it's open and available for people to make requests to so you can call the pizza shop up on their specific number and you can tell them exactly what you want and then in no time you're going to have the pizza arriving to your door as the respond so when you replace the values instead of yourself you have either your application which in this case will be a chat bot or your browser on your phone you make a request to a specific URL or what's called an endpoint and depending on the URL or number you've called there's a set number of things you can get back from them you need to include loot in your in your call and your request to the specific URL or number what you want back from them and then if everything checks out you know say you have the right authentication you've given the right password to get in which is where API Keys come in the server is going to process that request and send the information back and that's of course when it comes to the web there's information moving back and forth not pizzas of course so you're making requests to specific URLs or endpoints in this case I might have the liamotne.com API and you may be requesting to get from my photos maybe I have a gallery I have a photo section you may be requesting the first photo or the photo of ID number one you're requesting hey can I get photo ID number one and then it goes to the server okay yep that's all checks out then it's going to send that data back to your application or to your computer and maybe within that data there is a URL to the actual resource location of my photo when it comes to API calls within chatbot building a good example is uh capturing lead data so say your chatbot is chatting away and a client is tapping away on it and your chatbot sends a message and says hey would you like us to contact you via email or you get in contact with an expert they go sure and then you can send hey please provide your email and your first second name and then once you have that information what you can do within your Bot Builder is send that information off to sapier and zapier is going to process it or your fuse make.com or something similar it can process that and send that onwards to a Google sheet or to put it into your database whatever you want to do with it but in order to send this data out of your chatbot you need to make a request so what you're going to do is you're going to be provided as you can see here zapier is now the pizza shop and it's going to give you a link that you can send your data to so what you're going to do is in what's called a post request is different types of requests don't need to go that deep on it now but a post request basically allows you to bundle up a bunch of data in this case it's going to be maybe the timestamp of when the lead was captured maybe the first and last name maybe the email of the person it's going to bundle that information up and it's going to send it in a request to a post request to zapier to your specific endpoint URL are they provided you to so they're basically listening okay we're ready to receive your information when you send it they're going to go okay great we've got it and then they're going to send you back a response and basically approving it in this case and they're not sending any data back necessarily to you that you're looking for but they're just sending back okay yeah everything was good on our end we've received information and everything's been processed okay so what you'll get is an okay response and this is what you receive back a lot of the time in the responses from sapi and from there on the zapier side of things when you're setting things up you can basically pluck out the information that you sent in that sort of bundle of information you sent where does apia you can pluck out the name you can pluck out the the timestamp and the email and you can set that to different forms or different columns within your Google sheet or wherever you want to send it and so basically you can analyze what information you're getting back every time and tell it what to do with it so it can do its job another easy example of an API call within a chat bot could be part of your chat bot needs weather information and when the user says give me today's weather you make a call to a weather API you request a specific date range of information say I want the weather for this week and it's going to request it it's going to pull the information back and then you can use that within your application so it's all about requests and responses sometimes you're sending information away sometimes you're asking for it in return but it's all about the sort of back and forth and the information you're sending and the information they're sending back find a bit of jargon I want to touch on is Agents these things obviously had a big explosion of growth when our order GPT and things like this came out and I thought I'd just do a little bit of an explainer here just to make sure you're on the same page and the difference between a strictly a chat bot and an agent so the official definition if there is one an agent is a program that is designed to perceive its environment make decisions and take actions to achieve a specific goal or a set of goals an agent operates autonomously meaning it is not directly controlled by a human operator now the key word there is autonomously it's best to explain this with an example so say I have set up a travel assistant agent this is the guy in the middle looking happy there an agent's job is essentially to take a task break it down and analyze it into all the different different parts of it and then start to do those one by one in order to do a sort of multi-step and more complex task one example of a question that I could ask say I made an agent that's a travel related agent it has access to Expedia all these different sites sky scanner and can it has access to a bunch of tools now this is important we'll touch on this later but the input is going to be something like hey plan me an ideal vacation in Europe for a week in July now the agent is going to take that in it's going to analyze it and say okay how do I start to break this down first I need to look up what are the best places to go in July where are the good places to go in Europe and July okay I'm going to first do that and so once it's got this list of to Do's that initial list of first I'm going to search out the best places then I'm going to narrow that down to three then I'm going to analyze those three against the original question then I'm going to check Expedia for any hotels or things in the area then I'm going to go and book flights check flights as well and basically once it has this big list of to Do's then it goes on to using the actions that you've set up available to the agent so in this case it might use Expedia API or my just Google search in general ask for where's the best places in Europe once it's got a couple ideas you might start checking sky scanner for flights okay what's uh what's the cheapest flights or what's the best flights where can I get direct flights if it's going to work so having a bit more information on the input in terms of I want it to cost around this much money I don't want to do any multi-stop flights those kind of bits of information would make it a lot better but once it's gone through this process and it's actually pulled this information gone through its list of to-do's and then it can create a final answer and really evaluate that so it will check the final answer since you've gone through so many steps and it'll go back and say have I actually answered the question and then if I can confirm it will give it back to you so agents they do a lot of different tasks they can do step-by-step things and think on their own really and you get need to give them access to a bunch of tools really they call them tools there's different words for them as well but essentially a bunch of different functions that they can do a bunch of ways that they can interact with the real world and with the internet at large in order to get something done so when it comes to chatbot building you are not going to be building agents strictly that is quite advanced stuff but what you are going to be able to do between is connect an agent to one of your intent functions say if we had a chat bot and the the user said the same query I plan your vacation in Europe for a week in July you could have an intent classify setup where if they ask for some kind of plan you could pass it to an agent that you or someone else who created it can run through all these complicated steps send it back via an API call and then you can get that answer to the user so if you can create an agent or you can find ones to use data external and you can include them in the functionality of your app and that is one way that you could potentially use agents and your apps and with that done I want to give yourself a big pat on the back you have completed the theory you have completed the explaining the opportunities the uh the different types of chat Bots everything you need to know you now have the foundation that we can build on top of with real skills you've done your college now you're going to go into your apprenticeship you're going to actually start putting it into practice and getting some real world experience so I'm really excited to jump into the next section which is building these chatbots live maybe go take a bathroom break refill on the coffee because we've got a lot more to go here so let's get stuck into okay so what are we actually going to be covering within this live chatbot building session so firstly we're going to be doing some prototyping using the prototyping tools as I mentioned I'm going to show you how to quickly use chat based Ai and also Kodi AI I'm giving you a little bit of background on how you can use each of them and what those sort of workflow is with them then we go then we're going to be jumping into voice flow which is the bot building platform we're going to be using for all of the advanced builds in today's video and I'm going to be going over a bit of an introduction and orientation so you're familiar with everything and then we'll jump straight into building the three different types of chat Bots now it's not just going to be three chat Bots it's going to be two versions of each of them so a basic customer support and an advanced customer support a basic staff training and an advanced staff training basically generation and advanced one and so on there's a lot to cover I'm not going to waste any more time talking let's jump straight into using these tools so the first prototyping tool we're going to use is called chat base all the links to all the tools and platforms and softwares I'm using in this video going to be available in the description so just head down there you can find links to all of them anyway we're going to jump onto their website you of course are going to have to make an account once you've created your account and signed in you'll be greeted with this page here once you're logged in you're able to go to the my chatbot section and then click on new chat bot and creating a custom knowledge chat bot which is what we're doing here it's easy as literally dragging in a file or dropping a link to our website and so on so in this case I'm going to show you how to create one with a file so in this case I've got some different documents that I'm ready to put in that we're going to be using throughout the section this one is a customer support template or handbook really for a gym called Jerry's gym which is an imaginary gym that I've made up and got a document for so I've uploaded this it's ready to go it's within my 400 000 character limit depending on your plan you can add more context so when you go to a website if you scrape a really large website you might need to upgrade your plan in order to be able to chat over everything but in this case Jerry's gym stock is uh well within the balance within our free plan so I can create my chat bot let's get this thing out of the way and then just like that within a few seconds we have a customized chat bot for the serious gem document so I can say what are your PT plans price and it's nice and snappy and click that's one of the reasons I like chatbase uh it's so quick when you're doing this prototyping it's really good to see and you can say what about normal membership prices that already gives you a pretty good idea of how this thing works the key thing about chatbase is that you can go to settings you can scroll down and then you can start to play around with the prompt now prompting as we've gone over when you have a custom launched chat bot The Prompt that you provide is really important because it's basically the instructions on what to do with the information that comes back from the knowledge base I can tell I'm here to speak like a pirate and he's going to speak like a pirate or I can give it some very clear guidelines on if you don't know the question then do this if you do know the question then answer in this way or these are your goals this is what you're supposed to be doing so I actually have a prompt all written up and ready to go for this so I'm just going to paste in the prompt that I've written before I'm going to have this prompt available on my resource Hub along with basically anything else I'm going to mention will all be available on my resource type you can sign up and get access to all of it they're all completely free but this prompt is very good iPhone for customer support it gives it a name it tells them what the objective is it tells if it's in doubt refer to the support email and so on also things like how to format links so if you're going to have links in your knowledge base it's important to be clear about how you want it to reply sometimes you can get it to put it in markdown and essentially put a a live hyperlink into the chat so that's important to to have a bunch of these things in there so feel free to grab that prompt template and use any of the other ones that are mentioned in this video it's going to be on the resource Hub in the description then once you've set this up you can really do whatever the platform will out so in this case we can go to Integrations you can add it to a slack workspace but more so for chat based specifically as I said this is very good for prototyping spinning up a quick demo sending it to a client so what you can do is you can embed on a site so you can go save changes we can just skip the domains necessary and then we get these two little little scripts here so this is a iframe that can be put onto a website that's going to display the entire chatbot interface but then if you want the chat bubble you can copy this and add it to the bottom so I can copy this and head over to brackets now this is what you'd give to your client in order to put on their website and test out so I've just got a little demo site here that we can spend the test up on as you can see I've just pasted in the script tag at the bottom of the website again don't need to know too much about this but this is how a client would be able to use it you can pull it down here and I can start to chat away with it what are your PT class prices and there you go now this is how you can prototype and send it to a client this is why I like chat based it's so quick and easy to get going I've been able to prompt it so it's manipulating my information how I want it to and then I can even give this to a client and they can put it as an iframe in their website Etc you can also share it which is probably the easier way to send it to a client so if you click the share button and hit made public we can copy this copy new page and then we have the chatbot as well um where is your Boston location and there we go it's replying and there we go it's all working nicely one other feature you have within chat base is the actual design and the layout of things so you can come to this chat interface you can play around with the theme light theme dark theme suggested messages user message color and things like this so if you want to match it to your clients coloring in the way that their website is styled then you can do the same there so that's chat based really nice and quick and dirty great for speeding up prototypes as I said and that's about it for chat based feel free to use it as you wish to play around whatever you need to do next we're going to be doing some prototyping on Dante AI it's a little bit different to chatbase and if you want to follow along there's a link in the description some of them are affiliate links so if you want to support myself and the channel and some of this free stuff that I do feel free to use the affiliate link if not I'm sure you can see the URL on screen once you've created a free account you should see something like this just a basic dashboard here what we want to be doing is creating a custom knowledge chatbot to spin up a prototype with here so what we need to do is create a new knowledge base over here on the left hand panel click create new knowledge base now as I said in the earlier stages of this video we can either upload video URLs and add sort of 5-10 different URLs and it's going to pull the information from that video from the YouTube video sorry or we can be providing a URL to our website here so I could put my personal brand website and ask questions about the information on the site hopefully for simplicity's sakes I'm just going to upload the same document Jerry's gym and I'm going to create it and then I'm going to name this Jerry's gym and then I'm going to create the knowledge base so there is a limit on how much you can do within this a free tier so when you're doing this you may want to keep your documents fairly small otherwise you're going to have to upgrade I got in touch with the team and they've upgraded me to the professional one so I can show you guys some of the other features they have but the key thing that I've noticed when I was playing around with this and prototyping on my own is that the resume limit to the size of the documents you can put into your knowledge base on the free tier so if you're testing this out just want to check out how good it is and if you like it or not be sure to use a document that isn't be on that limit where you're going to have issues but once we've created this we have the knowledge base on the left we can choose to speak to it now we can say what uh your PT class prices and then we have for getting the same sort of responses I do like the the strength of chat history here so if I say what about for normal memberships so here I've tried to ask a sort of contextually aware question and ask it what about normal memberships when I've asked for the price of the PT classes before that said that there's no information about the cost of a normal membership so just picking up on the chat history context however it's mentioned that memberships are paid multi in advance Etc now let's try it again can you provide the link and there you go so this is one of the reasons I like Dante AI because the uh the chat history is actually really good an issue that I often have with platforms that I'm trying out is that when you're asking contextually working questions it doesn't pick up on what you're actually talking about and chat GPT is absolutely our enemy in a lot of ways with this when you're you'll find very quickly when you're dealing with clients that a lot of the time they will try out your demo or the product you've made for them and they'll come back and say this is like nothing at all like chat gbt it's not doing anything and it's because yes we're using custom watch bases it's a hacky way to get around the token limit and add new knowledge to it we're not training it and then cooking the information at the base level so having a a chat history on chat CPT is fantastic so you need to get as close as possible on this side of things as well and so by now you may be wondering what's the difference between this and chatbase I'll show you if you give me a second so first of all you can do the prompt editing same as with the chat base I think this is actually a paid feature within Dante AI so you will have to upgrade to their basic plan for 9 or 20 a month or something to get access to it but I can do the same thing here I drop in the prompt for my Jerry's gym AI so I can put that in there and then I can go next step and then you depending on the level of your plan you have access to all of these cool functions there's a ton of really cool customization features here firstly I can edit the suggested messages here so I can add another one saying how can I sign up for PT classes so we can have suggested questions down here in the bottom right so that as soon as they hop onto the chatbot they can click one of them it's a lot more user friendly to help them find frequently asked questions you can remove the powered by Dante depending on your plan you can remove this microphone Etc so there's a whole bunch of things custom styling custom fonts even I really like the editor and it allows you to make a really customized experience when you send it over to your client as a prototype there is also the opportunity to do custom URLs depending on your plan I believe you have to be on the 300 a month so it's definitely very up there and probably not something you want to do initially but being able to put this onto a custom URL and instead of having the danta AI a URL you can actually put a client's custom domain on it and be able to have the sort of white labeled and customized a chatbot at least for the client to use so that's a big step up and I haven't seen many of these prototyping kind of softwares allow you to put it out on a custom domain like that so one of the features I really like about Dante AI so if I confirm all those edits I now get a direct link as I can see here if I post this over I can have a chat to my chat bot here what are your membership plans Etc this is the kind of thing you send over to the client more importantly though you can go back and you have an iframe that they can put it onto their website so they can embed it into a one of their web pages then you also have the chatbot bubble the same as we had previously with chatbase you can copy this and then put it onto their web page as I just did before and it will pop up as a little bubble down the corner so all your favorite kind of deployment options with one of these prototyping tools but one of the key things about danta AI which I really like is that it's mobile responsive when you're on their web page so in this web page version the web chat if I inspect it this is just explaining it how it works on the phone but basically when you actually have this web page up on your mobile it's going to to look normal the proportions are going to be right and you're going to be able to do all the things that you'd expect to be able to do on it just through the web browser on your mobile phone so this is a great prototyping platform with a lot of flexibility a lot of customization in terms of The Styling and the property Etc so um really like this and as you can see it is a little bit different from chat based pricing is different but I thought I'd run you through this one as well just to give you an idea of what it does and just to give you a quick look at the pricing on this they have some really good lower tier options at 15 30 which tend to do a lot of the different functions that you need so have a play around see if you like it and if not there's another one coming so we can check that out now and finally the last prototyping platform I want to cover is called Kodi AI this is a little bit different to the other two as they have been this one gives you slightly different use cases and different deployment options so this can be very good for some cases and I just really want you guys to have a full view of the different prototyping options you have and how they can fit into dealing with different clients as always you can sign up to Cody in the description below I do have an affiliate link for that one so if you want to support me please use it once you're signed up for an account with Cody you're able to come onto this dashboard Here and Now quick orientation we have the chat we have Bots content and account where do you want to start in terms of creating these customized chatbot prototypes is to go to content now in this situation you can see I've created three different folders one called client One customer support one called client one marketing my uncle client one reporting now this is the real point of difference for these chat bots made by Kodi AI is that you can create these different folders as you saw earlier in the video and by creating different folders it makes it much more easy to not only manage the different information that you want to have access to on different chat Bots but also update them over time so they've got a new reporting document for a client I have a chatbot that's put onto their slack and it allows their managers to chat to it and get reporting information whenever a new week or month finishes up and we have a new report I can easily come on here and throw the report in there and then without the client having to do anything it's just going to update their knowledge base and they're going to be able to continue to chat with it as if it just happened magically so I really like that the folders featured here it can be very good so in this example my client one could be in e-commerce store and we have a folder for the customer support related documents a folder for their marketing related document in a folder for their reporting related documents and so I can create a chat bot as you're going to see in a second to connect to the customer support documents and then I could use that to put onto a web chat pop up so that people can ask questions on their website Etc so that's going to handle their customer support and then when it comes to internal reporting I can connect that to the slack Channel as I just mentioned they can have a chat away to it and they can continue to upload documents and then for anything related to marketing I can have its own sort of Silo of information that I can add to over time and this is a great way to keep things segmented and be able to update them in real time as your client needs them so to demo this we can open up the customer support document we've got my jiri's gym document in there already you can just upload it here it takes websites you can drop a link on it as well they don't have the video URL option like Dante AI does but you can still import our website and strip the sitemap you can upload a document as I've done here and then we want to go back to bots and I want to I'll just delete this one for now then we can go up to a new bot on the corner and then it gives you a bunch of cool for you guys who are not too familiar with prompting and things like this there are some great presets here so if you want to click on a factual one more of a document question and answer if you want to click on uh customer support they have a preset for that now what these are all doing is as I assume under the hood each of these different buttons has a specific prompt that when you click on it it's going to use that prompt in your chatbot so not rocket science they'll probably just tested a whole bunch of different options until they've got a a couple that work for different use cases now because we're super smart and we've done all our chatbot Theory just an earlier in this video we can actually go to the advanced mode yes I know what I'm doing and now we get control over the prompt we get control over the system prompt as well this relevant score as well so there's quite a lot of features under the hood for Kodi AI which is a really surprising for a platform like this and then there's even token distribution I love this so you can change how much context how much history and really have a lot of files that you can play around with so I'd say Cody AI in terms of a prototype platform is really pushing the limits in terms of how far these things can go before you have to get into the more advanced options but they've done a really good job to show a whole bunch a whole wide range of options and settings you can change and for someone like me this is heaven because there's so many different ways that I can tweak it and options for me is the bot developer to try to fix it if it's not working the way the client wants in this case I'm going to leave all of this the same apart from the prompt as you've seen before I'm going to be using this prompt that I've used in the previous sections so we've got my name is Dave an AI assistant tasked with answering questions about Jerry's jump then we can go next bot name we can call this Dave from Jerry's gym and do the same there and so here's the different models you can select if you get the premium one you have gpt4 in this case we just need GPT 3.5 which will do fine and then here's the key bit so I can easily select which folder I want to get the knowledge base from so in this case this is James gem Customer Support I'm going to click on the customer support checkbox but if I was making Jerry's gym reporting I can just click on the reporting option there easily create a chat bot and then deploy it to wherever we want to do it so I can create this now I can chat to it by clicking this instantly up open hi Dave so yeah they've done what are your locations in the east coast and boom Boston it's giving the links as well so it's using the prompt where I've told it to deliver at markdown yeah this is great and I've really copied the chair TPT UI here but the more important part for us is not necessarily using it within this but we can share it we can turn this on you guys are going to see my link but I can copy this and have a chat over here I can show the client this I can send this to them for testing they can do the same thing hi Dave what is your support email so this is the web chat deployment option that they give you I know it doesn't look great like this but there are a ton of different customization features that you can do so feel free to play around with that you can also get it on one of these Bubbles and just like the other prototyping options we have a shareable link that takes you to the full web page we have an option to embed it on the site as an iframe so it just blocks into their existing website then we also have the pop-up embed that you can add to a little bubble in the corner you do have to add their domain if you want to actually test it so be sure to get the domain and put it in here it's a little bit of info here in terms of how can make wild cards so it shows up on every page Etc but this is a little bit of setup you can do and that gives you a clear idea of how you can use Kodi you can get different folders and create different knowledge spaces for a client you can manage it all you could be managing 10 20 different clients within this content The Hub really and you can set it up exactly how I have have client One customer support client one marketing client one reporting create all the different Bots and the cool thing about Kodi is that once you've built all these different knowledge bases out and created the Bots you can super easily connect them to Integrations as you go to account and Integrations here you have slack Discord and jpo this AP is actually coming soon but slack is really big one if you're going to be working with companies like marketing agencies and in any company really that's using site for communication you can create a chat bot you can add it to a slack Channel and make it available to chat for all of the people in the workspace really cool deployments and I think you guys are going to think up a ton of cool options for this but this is another prototyping platform that I like to use as you can see it's different to the other ones each of them is good for their own little thing but that about wraps it up for prototyping or you can actually get done with the basic stuff and start getting into the fun stuff which is actually building powerful robots with voice flow now the first thing you need to do in order to follow along with the next part of this tutorial is to sign up to voice flow which is going to be the chatbot builder of choice for the rest of the tutorial it is a very powerful platform and there's a number of reasons why we're using it mainly because I think if you guys are going to be learning a new skill and really starting to become a chatbot developer you need to be starting off on something that has enough depth where you can build a really expert skill set now saying you're a chatbot developer on Kodi AI it's there's no depth to the platform the reason why I'm really liking voice flow at the moment is because there is so much depth to it I've been attending to the team and they've shown me how that massive and how complex you can make the applications here they have a ton of Enterprise clients so like large businesses BMW JPMorgan those big companies are using the exact same bot building software that we're going to be using today so I figured if I'm going to start you off on a proper bot Builder why not choose the one that gives you the most sort of depth that you can learn and really become an expert on because if you're going to follow the skill and follow it see where you can go with it this is going to be your new home so we may as well start to get your board up to speed on how to use it and the different functions and features it has if you are going to sign up and follow along I'd appreciate it if you could use my link in the description it helps me to keep these resources free for you guys I continue to make these monster videos so that I can keep doing what I love doing also before you dive head first and follow me into signing up for this platform the pricing is also very affordable as well it's going to be 50 a month for the Pro Plan which has a ton of great features but you do have the sandbox option to follow along with me within this video so they do have a free trial I definitely sign up for that and give a get a proper taste of all the different options they have but then beyond that it's also a shared editor so as you start to build a team if you're going to collaborate with other people hey figma style editor so you can get multiple people on there working leaving comments doing all sorts of stuff so I really like using this with my team at my automation agency and another reason why I think this is very fairly priced is that it combines a lot of the features that I've been using with other softwares into one so you basically have all of your body needs knowledge bases and everything for what fifty dollars a month on the Pro Plan so definitely check this out to see 100 clear those are the pricing options now we can get stuck into using this thing once you're inside voice flow we have a couple things uh just for the home screen here first of all you have your team obviously I'm with my Morningside AI team so you can add different workspaces you've got a resource Hub a education hub for them which is great so if you want to really take a deep dive into this platform and come up to speed even more after this video definitely jump into this I've got a ton of resources uh essential tutorials here they've got a YouTube channel as well so if you really want to get ahead feel free to dive into that back on the dashboard here they have templates which are really cool as well so if you want to come in here browse around the different templates they have it might save you a bunch of time for a future project and they have what's new the Discord Community is great as well if you want to sign up to that and then you have basically the the invite section so you can invite different collaborators so if you have a team member you want to bring on you can invite them here and then you have the important button which is to add a new assistant which we're going to be clicking now so in this case we're going to be doing it's called customer support we can click build in your assistant continue select the channel we're going to be choosing web chat for this one as you can see there's different deployment options so you've been learning all the stuff like that we've got the web chat deployment we've got twilio SMS deployment we've got WhatsApp we've got Microsoft teams one thing that I'm really looking forward to them dropping is this Facebook Messenger deployment because that's something I like to do with my lead generation chat Bots but here you can go web chat for now select the language English and continue so once you've got that you can create the assistant and then you're going to see a screen that looks a little bit like this so this here is the voice flow editor it looks nice and simple which is what you want but it does have a lot of features packed into it just walking you through firstly we have the designer tab on the left which is what we end right now so this is called the designer then we have the all-important knowledge base section so we're going to be adding some stuff into this shortly but you can add data sources up here select the different types of data all sorts of things then we have transcripts which you're not going to need to worry about just now here's a little transcript from previously you have analytics which is a very important thing to have Within These chat Bots how you have the Integrations tab which is going to allow you to export the the functionality to a or query your knowledge base and all sorts of things I think this is Advanced and we're going to be covering this probably in a later video but there's some really cool functionality that voice file allows you to do out of the box and then finally you have your project settings which is just some basic stuff the name Global no matches and your navigation methods I'm using this on a trackpad I need to probably change this over to trackpad now and then there's a couple different settings you can play around with this feel free to get comfortable down here we have the number of tokens you've used on your AI usage so they have been limit that you're allowed to use up in terms of AI usage throughout your different applications I've obviously got a quite a bit of token usage left you guys will probably have a smaller amount based on the trial that you've started but we can start jumping through the different features here up in the top left we have the sort of home menu just going to allow you to do a whole bunch of important admin things with the chat bot you can export it you can clone it you can go back to your dashboard Etc we have different Mouse types as we've just been playing around with you can leave a note so I can drop it on here and say something a nice way to just annotate it for your other team members I can drop an image right a video in here all sorts of different things in commenting of course as I mentioned before if I want to leave a comment I can jump here and say my teammate's done something stupid I can tell him that he's stupid right here and then if I want to go into the nlu model this is just basically a high level look at all of the different intents and things you've got set up so we'll be probably using this a little bit later in the video and we're doing the advanced builds but for now we won't need to look into that too much on the left panel here we have topics and our topics are essentially going to be Pages let's call them layouts or canvases maybe this is the home topic but I can create a new one and I call it topic two and then I can start an entirely new sort of page of my application but I can still access it through the chatbots sort of interface and through the flow of the conversation so if I wanted to build something out within the home that links to an entirely new page maybe it's like an entirely different section of the chat bot that's going to handle a very different bunch of features whenever the user hits a certain trigger in the home topic we can shoot them over to this new topic it might be the refunds topic or something like this and we've got an entire page built out it's just mainly for sorting the different parts of your application in order to keep it a bit clearer and not having it all modeled on the one page we won't be needing this for now let's just close us down fit back to the home one and we can delete this and that's most of the orientation we of course have the publish button up here which we'll be using later and then we have the Run button so whenever you want to test the functionality as we're going to be doing soon you can just hit the r key or the run it allows you to run a test of the bot and then we have the share button so if you want to send the Prototype over to a client in the same way that we've done with the prototyping softwares this of course has the ability to send over a quick prototype so we're going to be seeing this very soon you can change the branding the appearance as I've done here invite your teammates export and all sorts of stuff and up here you can easily change the name of your chat bot to whatever you want just edit it here I don't need to do mine for now and I will mention one more thing and that voice flow has their own assistant down here it's actually built on voice flow I've had a look at it it is insane the amount of complexity these guys have built into their own assistant using their own technology if you need any help this thing is going to be very good at helping you out so if you've got any questions if you don't know what something does if you're running into an error I really urge you to give this thing a go and see how much you can get done if you get stuck so this guy will probably end up being your best friend as you're learning this platform now with that helps keeping out of the way we can jump straight into sort of checking out these features now I've gone over this section A couple times and I've tried to walk you through all of these one by one and show you what it does but really without context they don't mean anything so the best thing we can do is just jump straight into building our first chat bot and you can learn on the go all of the concepts and things we talked about earlier in the video are going to come into play in full force as we're building this try to connect up the dots as to the things I've mentioned and how they look in real chat Bots but with that out of the way we can jump straight into building our basic customer support chat bot with voice flow now my use of the term basic throughout this video is going to refer to something that's a pure AI chatbot as I mentioned earlier in the video we have pure AI chat Bots old school chat Bots and we have these modern ones and in this case they're going to be custom knowledge chatbots so I say a sort of infinite loop with a prompted AI plus a knowledge base so we can get stuck into creating new knowledge base for this and and setting up this Loop that's going to go around and around now when you're approaching building a chatbot for a business it is important to understand what your goal is and what you're actually trying to achieve not only for you as a developer to know when you've got it right but to clearly communicate to the customer what to expect so you'll find a lot of the time if you don't get those the balance right between expectations and what you're actually able to deliver you're going to have issues with clients it's important to say this chatbot is a basic customer support chatbot it is intended to deal with 80 of the common queries that we're going to get in this case we're going to be talking about an e-commerce store called Pet Supply or PetSmart or something whatever I've called it all of the information that I've included in the knowledge base document is meant to handle the 80 of questions so it's not meant to be a Beal and indoor solution it's meant to say I don't know and send it off to a customer support email when it's a more complex question they can't answer so the 80 is still going to be a great help to the e-commerce business and we're going to work to build this first at 80 rate and then when we go to the advanced one we're going to try and really push the boundaries and and set something up that's going to best basically eliminate the entire customer support team now the most important thing to get right for one of these to work how you expect is obviously the knowledge base itself so when you're making a custom knowledge chatbot like this that relies so heavily on a knowledge base it's important to make sure the knowledge base content and the document is actually good in high quality it has all the information you need because that's going to really sting you in the butt if you don't have the right information available so here is an example of a e-commerce store called petmates that I got chat CPT to generate um it's not very good this is probably not a great example so here's one for a Jerry's gym one the example we used before now this is a lot closer to what you actually want to be working with there's a bunch of background information about the business we've got the contact information section which has got the support email we've got the gym locations the billing inquiries app support all of the locations and addresses Etc so this is really in-depth offering trials FAQs as much information as you can get and throughout it we are dropping the links to the support email so if this happens then send a support email we also have links to the parts of the website when it answers a question that's related to a membership system it's going to send them a link to Jerry's gym prices so having the links included into the document for these kind of chat Bots where they're dealing with 80 that's ideal for you to have the links included in the resource document so that it's able to send those during the chat as well and really direct the people to the correct resources since it doesn't have that full range of functionality to to deal with everything themselves but because the advanced version of the customer support chatbot that we're going to build after this is using the petmates example I'm going to be using petmates as our knowledge base for this so we are here on our home page we can head over to the knowledge base section list these resources and these documents are going to be available in the resource Hub so as I said anything that prompts the documents as well going to be available to download so you can follow along step by step with this link is going to be in the description first step is to go to add data source we're going to add a doc I'm going to click on the Petmate stock load that in there and it's going to load for a few seconds shouldn't take too long so that's all processed and ready to go now we need to go to the settings section and so in here as you can see I have the Dave prompt what I want to do is actually spin this to be for petmates.com or whatever website we're talking about so you can just go to chat GPT and take this exact same prompt that you guys are going to be able to get which works for customer support in most cases drop it in here give a bit more information about the new company we want and it's going to shuffle it around and make it about the company that you're looking to make it for change this prompt to be for a e-commerce pet product called pet that's the name of the assistant is Annabelle and there we go it's writing this out it's a great way to just repurpose The Prompt for whatever different business you're doing so feel free to take this prompt send it to chatgpt and say hey look this is the business I'm working with now can you re-shuffle this thing around to work for the business somewhere so we can copy all of this and head back the exact version of this is going to be available on the resource Hub so you don't necessarily need to follow along here but we can paste this in I want the max tokens to be about 200 temperature can be low I'm going to be using Claude V1 for this which I've been recommended as is pretty good so we can use Claude V1 in this case scroll down and save it and then when it comes to your knowledge base it's important to check that it's giving you the right responses so what we can do is once this thing goes away we can hit the preview button and then we can ask it a question so we go what information do we have in our resource Hub okay we can say how can I return an item to initiate a return log into your pipmates account go to order history and share return login to Facebook yep so that's responding correctly and it's telling us the right things to do so we've got the knowledge base set up we've tested it to make sure it's working then we can head back to the designer and start to actually set up the conversation design for this so step one is going to be grabbing a text and dragging it out here now we can put in here hi my name is Annabelle from pitt put a little dog emoji and there's a cool feature here where you can generate a couple different variations so it's not always going to be the same there we go hello Amanda Bell from hip Bates greetings I'm Annabelle from Peter mates and you can hit enter on each of these or you can just hit command enter to save them all looks good to me then we need another talk step so we're going to put another text one here you can just zoom in on this say how can I help you today okay we're back for day two of filming if you couldn't tell I was getting a bit dark so we're back the next day got a new cup of coffee ready to go so let's jump

luck and let's get back to the video so back we left off we have our first text card my name is Annabelle from pepmates and then we have the follow-up message as well so we can connect this up here and then if you want to quickly write and test your app you can just click R and we can hit run test and then there we go conversation has ended great now next thing is going to be hit escape and we can draw up here we can take a listen step so this is going to be capturing some information we want to capture something that the user says after that so hello how can I help you want to catch that information now we get into the first interaction with variables within voice flow so this is a variable called last utterance we have the last utterance which is typically the last message that the user has sent and then we have the last response which is the most recent response that the AI has sent so good thing to distinguish early on in this case we're going to be saving what the user says to us as the last utterance we're going to be capturing the entire user reply so the entire message they send and this is a little bit more complicated we will cover entities later but then this here is where we're going to be saving the response so we're going to take the entire user apply if we're going to save it as the last utterance now we can tape it to a bunch of different variables in here I can create a new variable and I can save it to that but in this case last utterance is just fine for us we're going to wait for the user to message us and then we're going to a that reply for later so next step is to get a response AI box these blocks enable you to send a message back to the user based on some prompting whether you're using an AI model sort of out of the box or using your knowledge base in this case we're going to be using our knowledge base and then we're going to be saying answer the user's question and then what we can do is reference the last utterance so this is going to sort of insert what the last article tool saved at and then it's going to inject it in there so if I go preview and I say what is your refund policy it's going to inject that into here answer the user's question what is your last refund what is your refund policy and there we go we're getting a preview back making sure this is all working and then the little magic here is that we can just Loop this back up to the top here so understanding how these little loops work is very important so as you can see here we've just got a little Loop going where we ask them how they're going and then we start the conversation they ask us a question we save it to the last utterance we pass that to the AI to answer from a knowledge base and then we just pass it straight back up and open the floor again so let's see this in action if I click here and go R run test hello Amanda Bell from petmates how can I help you what is your refund policy and then it's going to take that question save it as a last I don't want to take it down to the AI and then insert it into the prompt that we have here and you can also click play from here which is helpful if we go what is your refund policy and then it's just taking it straight back up to the top and we can ask another question so it's just looping around now understanding these Loops is really important because we're going to be using them a lot and this is how you can keep the AI kind of in an endless conversation there's a couple cool features we can build off the back of it but that's the basics right there and then we can ask another question how can I return my so how can I return an item to initiate a return Etc what about refunds but then it's also working so in this case I've talked to the voice photo team and they said that there is chat history here so as we mentioned earlier in the video in the concept section chat history is important especially for these kind of conversational chat Bots where you're working back with a customer support agent so the chat history is a thing here I will say it's not amazing it's not the best it's not super strong like chat gbt is but it is enough to have a little bit of context I definitely think there's room for improvement on this so I'll be talking to the team at voice flow and seeing if there's anything that they can do to potentially Crank that up and make it a lot more Chanty like when it comes to chat history so this is the basic Loop for a customer support chat but now in this case we don't have many links and things being put in here but the knowledge base itself so you're working with a different business you need to include lots and lots of links to the different parts of the website so say they ask about pricing or they ask to manage a membership you can just be dropping directly from the knowledge base as your response you say hey we can manage your prices here or you can change the system about your membership here's where you can do it and you can provide the link and so they're going to click through to that and get all the information they need or you can just start to drop the support email if there's any questions that are not within the scope of the chatbot but this is a pure AI chat bot just set up on a loop that's going to continually answer questions so this is just the start and what we're going to be doing now is going to an advanced customer support chat bot which really expands all this functionality lets voice flow really Flex its muscles and terms of what it can do for these kind of chatbots so we're now going from a basic customer support chat bot over to the advanced side of things now the first thing we're going to do is actually delete this connection here then we're going to select these select this and we can just Chuck that down there somewhere and what we're going to do now is drag this out and get a new block which is going to be called a choice block now this is a very very interesting and important thing within voice flow what we're going to do is set up a number of different intents so that the chatbot can pick up on intent from the user rather than just answering sort of from the knowledge base the whole time so we're going to be building in a number of functions into this chatbot as we've mentioned earlier in the video to make it do cool stuff and not just be stuck in this endless loop of being a pure AI chatbot so we're trying to identify that the user wants a specific thing in this case we're going to have things like they might want to leave a review on our e-commerce store they might want to leave some feedback Etc so we're going to build in a couple different features and then if none of those intents are detected in the user's message when we go around this Loop then we're going to just reply with the knowledge base is normal so we're going to pick off a couple different cool things and then have some sort of fallback which is just okay we'll just respond with the knowledge base here we have the choices what we're going to have one is a choice a choice a choice actually we can just click that so we just need three paths here so the first intent or the first function we're going to add to this is tracking that the user might want to track their order so we can come here and click on this we need to create a new intent so this is the how you set up an intent within voice flow so we need to give a couple examples to the system to the AI to the natural language understanding system that's underpinning all of this give them a few examples of the kind of things that might trigger this intent well in this case we're going to be saying a track order and then we're going to say where is my package that's how can I see where my package is can I get an update on my pack where is my order so I'm giving these manual examples just to really fill this out but what you can then do once you've got a couple good ones I really like what you want to do I like to click give five new utterances so this is going to use AI to generate more like it how long will it take for my order to arrive what is the status of my order can I track the shipment in my order yep these will seem good so you can either go through and just press enter on each of these one at a time like that or if you want to do will generate even more make sure that they're still on par as you can see this utterance level the strength by here the more examples we give it the stronger this is going to be and the better it's going to be at picking this up than the chat so what you can also do I will mention is if all of these look good what you can do is just hit command and return and it's going to approve all of them so this is going to save you a bit of time that I've found now we have our track order intent so this is going to pick up any time the user is asking about where their order is and then we can do special things with it so we can create that intent there I'll just leave that there for now then we're going to create our next one we're just going to be leave a review I'm so in this case we're looking for things like I love my product my audit arrives so fast I am very happy with my purchase I highly recommend your score so these kind of things where it's just raving about the product recommending the product Etc we want to be able to catch this and and get them to write a review on the product essentially so I was very satisfied with my purchase I'm impressed by the service here so pleased with what I bought definitely we'll be back to purchase more telling my friends so we can just go to command and enter on this I do quite like all of those that's good let's leave a review we can create that intent and then I'm going to create one more this one is going to be something about looking for products so looking for that in this case because we're in online pet store we're a pet smart or whatever break all this we're going to be putting in some keywords for what people might be looking for in terms of a product so what toys do you have for large dogs um for cats what products do you have do you stock any dogs so we can see what they want to generate us here if they gotten the right idea what type of products do you have do you have any dog food um do you offer any dog food products which products do you carry okay that looks good to me maybe we can throw in some for cats as well um what cat food do you have and now we can create the intent so now we have our three different intents so this is going to try and capture it as the message comes in same as before we're going to ask them how they can help but then we're going to potentially pass it through the intent classifier and give it a couple different routes that it can go before it ends up at the fall back so before back in this case we can set up here which is going to be in the settings we can have a node match and we can add it manually just going to leave this empty I'm going to create a new path and then what we can do is just route this over to here then we can take the no match and just route it over here for now and do the same sort of response AI step and then here we're going to have this exact same thing as we had on the earlier setup we had on the basic chatbot which is just to answer the user's question I'm gonna head back over here add it in as the prompt select knowledge base and paste that in answer the user's question now we have all of the different intents set up in terms of the different examples and it's ready to identify this message as it comes in now we need to actually set up what happens so to do this we can set up an intent here drop this and what we want to do first let's start with lever review so when they come down here and we detect that they are wanting to leave a review potentially based on them loving the product then we want to have an action we can go to intent then we can go to leave a review this is essentially going to teleport us up to this part of the chat so we're ready to start leaving a review so if they reach this part of the conversation up here they've probably just said based on our intent something good about the product so I really loved the experience the shipping time is so fast so we can jump straight into sort of going for the throat here and asking for a review so text you can say that's great to hear because I've just said something nice about the business and then we can drop another text card so it's not too sort of Blocky then we can say would you be interested in leaving a review I can send you a discount code for your next order then what we want to do is use a new feature that we haven't touched on yet which is buttons so we can add a button here that says yes sure and then we can add another button here by clicking add button and make it safe no thanks and then if they say yeah sure you can come up here and start a new block add a new text card so they've let us know that they're interested in leaving a review for a discount so we can say amazing can you please provide the product name and something you liked about the product and your experience shopping with us with this I can create a little message for your review so we're going to use an AI feature just here to generate them a review based on like one sentence from them so it really expands on the review and then all they need to do is approve it so we have that put in there then we can add a capture step in because we want to hear what they say with this I can leave a little message for your review so we're going to capture the entire user reply which is going to include a name of the product and something they liked about the service and then we're going to take this up here and we're going to use what's called a set AI step so we've used the response AI before which is going to generate a a response back to the user what we want to do is just sort of the set AI can work without necessarily putting something out in the conversation so it's basically like running a little chat CPT function you might send a bit of information to it tell it to do something with it and then you can save that information back as a variable and use that variable later on so as you'll see if we use the set AI card here we can say generate review so this is just the name of the particular card here and we're not going to be using our knowledge base this time and what we're going to be doing is just processing the information that we got from the user which is being captured in the last utterance variable and then we want to prompt this AI into generating us a little message for them to send back so in this case I have the prompt ready to go now if you see me go a little bit fast do not worry because all of these templates and everything I'm building here is going to be available on my resource Hub so at any point you want to copy some of this and not have to write it out by hand you can head down below and grab the template then you can import it into voice flow and you have all of the stuff I've been working on all at your fingertips and you can even just take that and start using it so if you're struggling at all if I'm going too fast there is going to be the template in the description for you to go over yourself at your own pace and when you pick apart what I'm doing here and why it works how it works so and really make it your own as well if you want to modify it feel free to do that and start selling it if you really want to so the prompt that we're giving this is that the following is information from a customer on the product you purchased from our eCommerce store pet mates and what you like about the product or experience don't mention e-commerce please create two to three sentence of review based on this information that is cheerful and reflects well on the business and then all you need to do is put a colon and then we're going to reference the last utterance that we've received here so we asked the user for some information we capture it into the last items variable and then we just inject it into this prompt here so what we want to do is create a new variable we've already made it like what you can do is just click the create new variable and name it the exact same thing so we're going to be calling it tracking API response and then in the prompt settings we're all good maybe we can turn this temperature down a bit I don't want it to be too too creative here and then we have the max tokens we can probably bring that down a bit and yeah now we can do a preview so if I hit this we can actually test what it would output if we put something in so I could say I bought the doggy bottle chain really fast it's super easy to use so I like this with a voicemail how you can very very easily test the outputs I absolutely love the portable dog you bought it from petmates I've only did it arrive quickly but it's also incredibly user friendly I highly recommend this product and this wonderful company I mean it's a little bit overboard you can prompt this more as you want but I think for the purpose of this tutorial this is going to be fine now we have our output from the review generator then we need to actually save the output of this to a variable so we can use it later in our application in this case I've already created it called review but you can just click here and create a new variable and create one called review also you can click here and it's going to save our output to their variable and then we can add a text card and we can get the ok so we're going to say thanks is this okay to post for you and then we can provide the review this is just going to be again inserting the variable into the chat so this is how the Syntax for it is going to be using the curly braces around it in this case we're using the curly braces around the review object and I put some quotations as well to let them know that we're kind of quoting what the review will be eventually then to approve it we just need to add a button here we can add looks great here I want to add another button also and we say no I don't like that okay so now we have these two outputs we're going to tell them where they want to go we're going to have a talk step here and we can have another talk step here this is an interesting chance to take a look at the kind of design elements that make the the editor voice Globe feel a lot less boring and plain so we can have a red block for the no route and a green block for the yes route so makes it a bit clearer without having to name all these different blocks we can see very clearly what this sort of happy route or unhappy router so it looks great or no I don't like it so to edit the colors you just need to right click on it and it's going to show you what color and you can use the slider Etc you can add comments you can save the library all sorts of things if the user approves it we can say amazing I'll post this on your behalf now then if you're actually building this up with a really common store you could either integrate it into their system so they'll automatically or you can use API or something like this to basically take this information send it to a Google sheet for a VA to go through and start to add these reviews and manually once a week or once a day whatever you want to do and then if they say no they don't like it we can say I'm sorry I'll try harder next time please leave a review on our product page I'm not going to bother within this application but we can Loop it back around and try to revise it and have sort of a back and forth with them until they're happy with it but for the sake of this tutorial I think this is good enough this is the branch of leaving a review ending a helpful little node to add a sort of a reset I found as you put a text on just here above what I'm going to call our main Loop so this is our main Loop here what we're going to do is when we can send this one back here on its own but right here we can just make the chatbot say how is there anything else I can help you with maybe generate a couple different versions of it just something else I can do for you sure that looks good that's good to name this one back to me look maybe I'll give this a color and then what we need to do is connect the back to main Loop up to the main Loop of course and then what we can do here is a cool feature of voice floaters to be able to drag this and drop it here and we can actually go to actions go to block so here we can actually type in back to main Loop and now instead of having to draw this big Arrow out that goes across the whole screen we could just make this little thing here that's going to shoot them back over to this and start it again so I think with that we're good to actually test this out we can click the Run button here but you can hit run test now because we've played around without intents every time you add new things to intents new utterances and things like this you actually need to do what voice locals training I'm not 100 sure what they actually do under the hood I'm sure it's just bundling up the intense and putting that into a system-wide prompt or something anyway you need to click this button and it trains it I know we're supposed to not say that but they do something here figure it out anyway you just need to give it a few seconds to dial in the natural language understanding system and then we're ready to go so hi we can just restart this actually just click on the plus button here click on the play button on start hello I'm available for petmates how can I help so the first thing I want to test is that this no match is working so that if none of the intents are triggered we're still sending it to sort of a regular customer support knowledge base so if I ask something about nothing to do with ordering nothing to do with reviewing nothing to do with what products we're looking for if I just say what is your refund policy it should route it all the way down to the bottom here and then answer it from the knowledge base yep and our return policy is great so that side of things is working now we need to test if it's sent us back up to the top of the main Loop now we can ask you I'm really happy with my purchase boom and then what we've done is it's taken us up to the leave review section as we planned because it picked up on our intent that we were happy with the product and now it's taken us to this section up here sort of teleported us up that's great to hear would you be interested in leaving a review I continue with discount code for your next order and then we go yes sure amazing can you please provide a product name Etc I've just run into a bit of an interesting issue here guys so it's important that you see this stuff live so what we've set up is an intent that listens for when they say they've loved the product right so if I say that's great would you be interested in leaving a review yes sure and I go I loved my doggy bottle okay so so fast and my dog loves it let's copy that now if I send that we think it's going to go onto this generate review section but what it's actually doing is jumping back to here here you can see it's important to come up here and click the debug mode actually so if you want to turn that on you can see a lot more but we're jumping back to this legal review section now what's actually happening is it's picking up on the intent we created originally to look so what we need to do to fix this and to make sure it goes through to this generate review block is to click on this come to the settings here and then when it comes to intent scoping only intense in this step so that's going to prevent it from listening to Global intents and it's going to run through as we expect so if we go here leave a review hit the play button yes sure I'd like to leave a review I've also set up the no route here you can see I've just taken node to go back to the main Loop and it asks hey how can I help you with anything else now we can paste this in here I love my doggy wallet came so fast and the dog loves it now it's going to go to this step yeah there we go thanks is this okay for you to post the bottle is perfect for our walks and hikers so convenient looks great I'll post this for you and it shoots us back is there anything else I can help you with and bang we're back to the main Loop so that is one example of how you can set up an intent and build a cool little function around it I'm going to start to speed things up now that you understand how intense work how a lot of these cards work what these AI things the AI features do and how we're kind of routing things around this app in general or going back to this main Loop a lot of the time before sending them back to this so this again where we are right now in the conversation is back on this main Loop and it's ready to pick up any intent from our questions or it's ready to send us to the knowledge base again if we say what is your refund policy it's going to send us down there okay now I'm going to speed run through one more of these intents that I think I really want to show you guys how to use external API calls to get information I will send information at least first things first we need to go to the event section click on intent drag it down here so we have a new little area I'm going to call this track and Order and then we want to have this go to track an order so if the intent is triggered we can go to track an order now I don't want this particular function to do is actually the text first of all via intent classification if they're asking for a an update on their order or they're wondering where their Packages Etc so that's going to trigger this coming out here then we're going to ask them for the order number we're going to check our our database and pull some information back on that order number and then use AI to manipulate the response and give them a natural language response to where the package is so first text is going to be please provide us with your order number so this is obviously coming off the back of something mentioning about like where's my package because that is what was set up in the utterances for this particular intent and sorry guys if you're not sure what utterances are then each one of these different lines or ways that you can trigger this intent is called an utterance so we have intent which is the whole thing and then we have utterances which are examples of showing that kind of intent so just to clear that up there first first message here is going to be please provide your order number and I'll check the status for you then you want to open the floor to the user to message us so it's going to be a capture step we're listening for a response we're going to capture the entire user reply now in this case we could actually set up a custom entity to try to extract the the order number but it doesn't come sort of out of the box so for now we're not going to touch intense we're just going to do pass the exact order number and assume they're giving it to us in the right format and then what we're going to do is come over here send another talk step and let them know that we're checking in on their order and now for the real fun stuff this is what I really like to do with these kind of Bot Builders is to actually integrate it or make it access some external information and pull it into the chat and make it more contextual make it more valuable all that sort of stuff so in this case what you would be doing is taking that order number and then depending on your e-commerce client querying yeah after ship API or whatever wherever they're handling the track and maybe even the Shopify API if you want to be pulling directly from the store you'll probably be using a tracking API like aftership in this case I don't have any Commerce clients to do this on currently so I'm going to be setting up a a zapier store just to put a little bit of dummy data in and simulate how we might pull some information back in this case we're going to be making a get request so we're going to be asking to get information from my Xavier store and that's going to be done with this URL here now this goes back to our API section we'll be talking about requests and responses in this case we're going to request information on a specific order from our API so to get this figured out you're probably going to need to look at the documentation for the particular API that you want to use in this case I've retested it all out I can just paste it my JPS store URL here so that's basically the number that I'm going to be calling to get the resources that I want within this is going to be as you can see over here on Postman I've done a little bit of testing this is the information that's going to be returned when we call it so I have the order number and then I have some tracking updates I will just generated as such as dummy data but ideally you'd be getting this from after ship or something like this and it's pulling back all of the latest tracking information what we want to do is is grab this whole thing based on the order number and then we're going to pass that to the AI to write a response to it so we have the URL we have it set to get we don't need anything in the headers we don't need anything in the parameters now I can't leave my zapier store exposed for all of you to to hop on and start pinging so I'm not going to be able to show you the exact URL but this is just a placeholder and a dummy for what you would eventually do with the clients so in this case I'm going to create a new variable it's going to be called tracking API response you can create it here I've already got it what we're going to do is send a request we can just click the send request button here and it's going to we've got a 500 error so internal server error oh yeah we got that error because I haven't put the S colon slash slash and we can send the response and there we go we've got all of our information back so this is being stored if you just want to see if your store is a very basic way of storing a bit of information absolutely just a web page with this this information as I've done it so you can add a ton here I've just got the one but in this case we can pull this information back from the store and then we can pass it over to an exponent of our applications we have the information we're saving it to the variable of tracking API response and then we're going to be taking that onto the next step so if the API call succeeds we're going to do something up here actually it's going to be a JavaScript step and if it fails we're going to do something down here and we can say a text step again maybe I'll change this block color to be red and I'll change this to B Green okay now in order to do something useful with the information we've gotten back from the API what we need to do is first do a little bit of code and that was scary but don't worry what we're doing is just calling the variable that we've just saved and we're taking all of this this code let's let's call it code it's called Json and what we're doing is is stringifying it and turning it from this sort of object structure which is a a data type just like sort of flattening it down simplifying it down to just being a string so we're just making it into something that we can pass around within our application and use is within our AI query so we're just using json.stringify you're going to be able to get this code from from the templates it's very very basic so I'm sure you guys can probably just read it from there and copy it and then what we need to do is take that information and create a response out of it so what we're going to do is use the AI step here we're going to use a set AI or let's pop here and then what we're going to be doing is using the AI model this is going to be summarize tracking update so we've got a little prompt here please give us a brief status report to the customers asking about the order here is the latest tracking info and then what we're doing is pasting in all of the information that's just come from the API that we've recorded take made the API call saved it to a variable we've flattened that down into a string that we can use within this part of our application and then we're using some example responses saying given all of this information these are the kind of example responses we want and then also reminding that you're responding mid conversation it's not do you need an introduction just just give us the message and that's we need to do so we want to apply this to I think I've already got it saved here order up update so you can create a new variable and just call it order update I'm going to save it there and then we can actually preview this so I'm going to preview it get the information from here this is the example that's going to come back from the API now we can generate and see what it's going to give us your order number one two three four has been shipped by China Post and has arrived at the original Depot of Los Angeles Etc so this is a good little update on the order that we can send back to them we've done a good job to take the information from the API process it and I'll send it back so we have saved this to our order update variable now we can just go here and go order up there great so now we can actually just test this quickly so there's one little thing I missed out here that I need to add this response word into here so make sure you've added into the capture response you're also capturing What's called the response a good way to debug this if you're having issues is to actually just sometimes it'll be returning stuff but not actually saving it or doing something wrong it's actually a good idea to add a text card here and actually just put the response so I was able to see it printed out in the chat what was going wrong so if I go up here and I can play from this part again let's go to prints out what's actually being returned within the chat here so there we go I can see the information we're getting and then this is the response it's getting so now I know it's working I can just delete this come here click that right click and delete and then we're good to go there we go so now we're getting a nice little response back and then after that we can just send them back to go to block back to my look and if this doesn't work issue with Qing order information then we can just go and get actions go to block back to main Loop sweet so that's about as much as I want to do within this application for you all so let's run through it quickly we can we don't have this look for product section that's sort of just dummy dummy information there now you can very easily add that in and have some kind of assistant that helps them find the chatbot you can have a knowledge base that is all the information on your products and they can ask back and forth and help them find products so I'm not going to cover that within this video it will be here all day we can run through here now so if I say where is my package jumps up here great please provide the order number okay my order number is one two three four great now I'm going to check for information thanks checking out this won't be shown in the actual chat it's just the the debug mode shows you all the information so we can turn this off up here and it won't appear so your order's been shipped it's excellent is there something else I can do for you and so that's a quick walkthrough of an advanced or modern chatbot that uses an intent classifier Loop so every time we come back down to this we're going to run through it ask them they can ask a question ideally we can pick up on a specific thing that they're interested in doing and then we have built out specific functions to deal with that that interact with the business that pull the data from different places they can do valuable things Beyond just talking to them in this little bubble so what we can actually do now is publish our chatbot I can show you this we can go publish we'll call it a V1 publish it so it's not successfully published we can embed the widget so we can click on this and we have all of this information here so we can go to the web chat section it's going to actually help you do it here but we're smart boys and girls so we know what to do so you can play around with the settings here you can play around the appearance customization I'll let you guys do all the fun stuff there but there's a lot of things you can do in order to customize how it appears and I can copy this and do as I did before just give you a little example of what this looks like I can come in here and edit to there boot up the site so when it comes to actually putting it on your client site you can just give them this code and they'll be able to add it on themselves as we can see down here in the corner we have the started web chat hey my name is Annabelle from petmaids how can I haven't customized this as you can tell but this is what your client will be able to have on their website so we can remove The Branding and things like this where is my order please write order one two three four and there we go back to what we're just doing so this is how you can put it onto a website you can provide the client or whoever you're working with with this particular little script you can make all the customizations you want and that's how you can actually deploy to a web chat there's also another cool thing I want to show you briefly when that is if you want to share it we can go share the Prototype so we're actually just working on this as a as a prototype and you want to show the client you can open this link in a new tab and here we have a actually password protected if you want to do it so you can add a password in the effort called Jerry's and you can go Jerry's view the Prototype and there we go we're into the chat you can send this to clients to demo with I love live and there you go so that's how to make the beginnings or release the foundations of an advanced customer support chat bot using intent you can prototype it you can send it over to a client with this you can send them the script tags out onto their website all sorts of options here but that is the web chat deployment free a advanced customer Sports outbot now what we're going to be doing is jumping into a very very similar example but we're going to be deploying it to WhatsApp as well so if we go back to the dashboard how to get started with our WhatsApp staff training chatbot we can go to the new assistant we can type in staff training chat what we can go build an assistant and go next and then when you select the channel you need to select WhatsApp and language English whatever you want to do and this is going to ensure that we're setting it up on the WhatsApp Channel Once you click create and when you've done that you should see a blank canvas like this with the WhatsApp similar at the top knowing that you've in a WhatsApp deployment style chat but I've already got my one here so the point of a staff training chatbot is to allow access to all of the relevant information and training documentation within their business making it available through a sort of permission list and around the clock access to this information so whenever a employee or a contract or something has a question about the business instead of having to call up a manager and start off a whole communication string of emails or text or whatever it is basically distracting the people higher up in the business from the important tasks you need to be doing instead they're dealing with little small Castle over here and they're trying to answer questions for people who are in that ranks below them so by centralizing all of this information into a custom models chatbot you can take it and give it access to them in this case we're going to be doing it through a WhatsApp chat bot so that whenever say you have a contracting business and someone has an issue with something on site or they can just pull up the WhatsApp chat and actually ask a question say hey what are you supposed to do when this happens or who's the person to contact if there's a leak in this building or something so all of this information can be put into a chatbot it can get everyone on the same page and this can be a very cool thing to offer in terms of your automation package in terms of this and this can be a cool deliverable and particularly handy in specific Industries so it's not going to be amazing for all Industries but there's some specific areas where these kind of things can be very very valuable so I thought I'd include it in this video to show you another application for this chatbot technology and voicemail in particular okay so we're going to be starting with the basic customer support chatbot and it actually uses is the exact same loop as we've just done previously which is a short little introduction about who the person is you're talking to and then it goes into this main AI Loop so this is the pure AI chatbot kind of style and this is going to be answering from a knowledge base that we've created in this case I have it over here training.box I can pull this up to give you a little bit of an idea again I've just created this with chat gbt but in this case you'd want to get as much information as you can on the business that you're working with and really a comprehensive guide on on how to be an employee at that company in this particular case we're talking about a solar company called Smith solar and this particular chatbot is a sales rep training chat bot so when you're on board a new sales rep this is going to have all of the information in it so that they want to know okay what are the what's the voltage or what are the Watts of our particular solar panel what are the brand that we work with what are our payment terms are there any special discounts that we can offer at the moment so this kind of information can make it really accessible to these new sales reps and you bring them up to speed and even with common objections and things like this so This has a lot of information I have fairly big discounts referral discounts payment plan options common objections and solutions Etc CRM and Lead processing so what the sales rep should actually be doing he or she can just say hey I've just closed the client what am I supposed to do in the CRM and it's going to tell them the exact steps you need to take so you get the team all working on the exact same information and then clearly go on doing the things you want them to do at the right time so this document is of course the probably the biggest and most important part spending your time making sure this document as A1 is going to be a much more valuable than spending a ton of time building the chatbot out so this basic Loop will do the job for you in most cases but we're going to add a little bit of functionality just to make it a bit cooler so you've got your document again this is going to be available on my resource Hub if you want to get out and follow along I've added my data source here uploaded it and then what we have is the same loop as before you can go back to the project we just did and copy and paste this in and I've changed this around to being a guy called Angelo from Smith solar sales rep assistant I'm here to help with any questions you have what would you like to know so I can just connect this up here intro message a main link and now getting a major part of any of these customers chatbots when it looks so simple like this there's usually a lot of complexity happening elsewhere and in this case it's happening on a training document and how that's structured and the information that is included in it but then also we have the prompt as well so we have the settings up here in the knowledge base maybe I'll change this over to quad V1 for now temperature I'm going to have it nice and Low Max tokens and then I've got this prompt here this is going to be available in the resource Hub so if you want to make a a sort of sales rep stuff assistant chat bot you can use this exact same prompt as well and then we're going to be able to save that come back and give this thing a spin so we can see play from here what discounts can offer and there we go here are the discounts we can offer referral discounts early grade discounts payment plans Etc what is a PPA PPA is a power purchase agreement so it's all working good we've been able to ask it questions escapes get out of there the cool thing about this is that we can actually test it directly on WhatsApp send us out as demos to clients when you set up your app for the first time it should have asked you a bit of information about where you might be interacting with this on WhatsApp so I've already given it my number so this option pops up here on the top right and I can click test on WhatsApp and just like that that messages me sent to my number and I can update it up here if I want to change it to a client's number but if I go over to my WhatsApp here now this can work on my phone or on my laptop I'm just doing it here for ease of use it's popped up YT staff training is really fused okay launch the assistant then it's going to kick the chat off what would you like to know I'm Angela what how do I use our CRM all right what is the best way to handle the cost objection they are saying it's too expensive and then we go we're able to chat to the chatbot with on WhatsApp now this kind of WhatsApp deployment is good for testing and sending to clients for demos to approve when it comes to actually deploying it really for production you're going to want to get your client to set up a twilio account and follow the steps here available on the documentation for voice flow so that's a bit different to actually get it up and running in a in a proper production sense but it's fairly easy to set up with things like twilio you're going to need to be using your clients twilio account for this so just be sure to communicate that early on that this needs to be set up on theirs and at the end you're going to be able to connect the the app that you've made to your WhatsApp business account that they're using and then you're going to be able to deploy that and have this thing ready for production and ready for General use by the team now in order to take this to an advanced chat but we're going to follow the same kind of process but we're going to take an attempt classifier and we're going to add a function in this case I'm just going to do the one because I think you get the message but we're going to be doing something a little bit cooler with what we're doing within that specific action so we can start to make the same modifications as we did last time which is to disconnect this we can select this by holding shift and then selecting it all we can move this guy away a little bit and then we need to get an intent classifier going so what would you like to know we can go listen and we want to go choice you have the special action or function that I want to build into this app and it's going to be a incident reporting so this can be good for all sorts of sort of instruction or any any labor kind of businesses where there might be incidents to report this can be very very important for health and safety purposes and things like this so I want to have a function where it's able to detect if they want to report an incident and then take them to a specific set of steps and then we're going to do something with that incident data and which is really cool I'm going to show you in a second so first off we need to actually set up the intent for reporting an answer so we need to click on the choice block we've added here head over to create a new intent I'm going to call this a report incident and you can say all right report into the event report and accident reports and issue there's been an answer I need to report an incident Etc so I've got a couple here now I can just generate 10 more see what they give us there's been an accident yep that checks out reporting issue report next and I want to report a problem register an issue document an accident file a report file up it's not a complaint I need to report an incident sure okay so we've got our tent set up with a very strong excellent level of utterances you can create that intent and then we need to have the fallback option which can be set up here no match we can add manually and then we're going to add a path to this as well so what we can do with the path is just send it over here what we can do actually save a little bit of time let's just head back over here and grab this and we can drop this over here we can delete these so if there's no match we can send it to the knowledge base answer the user's question excellent then we're going to Route this back around maybe put it down here we need to delete this so if it does to get that report incident intent then what we can do is add it up here we're going to go report an incident I hope you guys are starting to see the pattern here now and then what we can do is take them through okay what's first thing when you say okay first thing you might ask is is this urgent is there an emergency or something like this we can say is there an emergency okay is there an emergency now as you can see on the listen side of things there aren't actually buttons with any basic deployment of WhatsApp within voice flow you don't have access to buttons but you can do it on the advanced setup there's a little bit of custom coding you need to do with a riplet so we don't actually have that option here but we can still do a choice and we can use natural language input to determine what they want so path one we can have this as a yes option and then are we going to add another path as well and these are built out of the box so as you can see we're just selecting an intent voice loads obviously got a pretty good idea of what a no intent might be so this isn't going to necessarily give them a button it's just going to open the floor for us to say what we want so if I just run it from here actually let's just set this up this is the emergency fix okay so if it's an emergency please call 9-1-1 and get the help you need from the agency Services we don't really want the chat away and what's happening is emergency so they should be getting straight to the action but if it's not an emergency then we can say okay can you provide some info on what happened include the following rocks time of incident where the incident occurred three who was fall and what happened okay so we're asking them for a bit of information about the incident with this info I can okay we can just test this out make sure our intent is working correctly and all the stuff up here is as well what would you like to know report and we need to train the assistant like that when you add a new intent utterances you need to train it again as I mentioned earlier we just need to do one little thing here click on this we can do actions and we can go to intent and in this case we're going to be going of course two deep report Incident That's in so we can play this again run test report and incident is it an emergency there we go no it's not great so that's all working fine we can play this again from here with the play button again and because we've set up an intent it doesn't need to be a strict Max so I can say sure rather than yes so that's because uh The Voice flow intent has a bunch of different options that we built into it and the AI has a good understanding of what is a sort of yes intent or a no intent so we've got our non-button using routing here so we can just provide natural language in let's go into relative to the different places now we need to take in this input click the capture it's going to take in the information we're going to to save the entire user applied to the last utterance yep that's all good with me next we're going to use a set AI step to extract a bunch of information out of what they've just said so they can provide a natural language so they can even like use dictation and just say hey I was standing outside on the porch I'm working on a project and then Dan came along and this happened and he got an Island's foot and this is the issue so they can provide that all in sort of a jumbled mess of ticks but we're going to use the AI to do is extract that information and put it into variables and then we can use this variable for the cool next step that's coming up in a second extract entities okay so I've done a little bit of prompting here I'm looking to firstly extract the date and time so you are an expert text extract that your job is to identify information within a body of text and pluck out the specific information for the entity you're looking for now actually I might just make this a system-wide prompt cut this out so we can go to the prompt settings and add this as a system message so all of these are going to be text extractors or information extractors we need to turn the temperature way down we don't need that many tokens at all we don't overspend and then what we're going to do is I've told it from the text provider to extract the date or and or time and provide it in the format day month month year Etc use 24-hour time assume that the year is 2023 but you're going to save this to a new variable called date and time we're going to create a variable and then we're going to do the same thing but for the different entities so for the text provided extract any any names I mentioned we're going to add this to a new variable called names and then we're going to do it again add another one and then we have from the text related extract any locations building names or place names we're going to call this locations create new variable and what else do we have what happened contact provided extract effect what the topic of the text is and identify what the incident was and what happened then we can call what happened we can create a new variable put the temperature way down system prompt or ready to go you're an expert text extractor your drivers too so we just need to add this little bit at the bottom to each of them so insert the variable come down come down pasting these into all of them and then what we can do is actually preview it so if we click back on here preview now we can say at 12 M on the 12th apart if I was at the on and leave with very big and he slept on a first pass wood on the deck that was delivery and Earth is heading back okay we can generate see if we get the outputs we want okay we've got a couple tweaks to make here I wasn't too happy with it I mean what you need to start doing here is providing examples so say you put an import and output input and output then you can really dial in exactly how you want it to respond for the purposes of this tutorial I'm not going to play around with it too much but I think for now this will do the job if I preview this it's going to take us through all these different things okay so it's got the date and time coming out names mentioned Barry b yeah there's a little bit more prompting that can get rid of this stuff so we just get the action variable we have the locations building names placement names topic incident what happened Okay so we've got the information out now we've got them saved to the variables now for the cool part which is actually to take this information and push it over to a Google sheet so that we can analyze or do something with all of this information weekly so we want to analyze all the incidents that happened in the past week okay where are they where are they happening most often we can look through the spreadsheet Etc so easy data collection on the employee side of things and then it can be easy analysis of all these different things on the sort of management side and admin sites in order to get this information out of our chatbot over to a Google sheet we need to start to use automation platforms which is one of the things I wanted to show you guys how to do within chatbots so right now we're just going to quickly go through using one of the automation platforms that you can use and show you how to connect your chatbot to at least a Google sheet but the same principles applies where you can send the information over and then manipulator on the automation side of things so I'm not going to be covering the full in-depth of the automation platforms I'm actually saving that for a future video so if you want to know more about the sort of other side of this business model where you can build the chat Bots but also build the end immigrations and how it actually interacts with the business be sure to subscribe to the channel because I have a another big video coming on that to show you guys everything you need to know there now first things first we need to decide on what platform we're going to be using in order to create our automation so in this case we have zapier which is something that I've used quite a lot but there's also make.com which is something I've been getting recommended a lot by my community members just purely on the cost basis so it costs eight times less I think to use make it is a little bit more complicated but I believe it has a lot more depth in this tutorial I'm actually going to be signing up myself and trying out make I haven't used it much before so you're kind of going to get to see me learning live alongside you but we're going to set up I'm sure it does the exact same functionality as zapier we're going to be using an automation with the mate since you we can send the information up to make it's going to handle it we can tell it what to do with it and add it to a Google sheet so first things first we need to actually create an account on make link to sign up to make is going to be in the description I think I do have an affiliate link for that one as well so again if you want to support me in the channel you can use that link if not the domain is making.com it's not very hard to remember so once you go over to make.com we're going to sign up or sign in going to log in here once you're in the make dashboard here we can head over to templates now I think we need to go to web hook we can click on web hook and then hit the first one add data to Google sheet receive via web hook you can click on this they've got a template ready for us to use so we can click Start guided setup what you're going to do is create a new hook we can click add I'm going to call this incident reporting web hook I can save this now it gives us this URL here which we can copy to our clipboard and then we can head back over to our voice flow and now we need to drag out an API section very similar to what we did in the last one but we need to put a get request here I believe we're doing then we need to set this as a post request because we're going to be posting some information over to make.com and then we need to add in our parameters the information that we want to send has been all saved to variables from this extract entity step that we just did so that was the point of extracting it all into different variables now we can go into the body and we can start to go what did we get out of this we have the date and time the name change the location and what happens so we can go date and then we can go date then we can add another one and we can go names we can go people we can go names then we can add another one we can go not people but they locations we'll go location and then we can go finally we can go what happened what happened and now we have all of that information packed up we can send a request off to make we can hit the send request button let's go to uh names Liam location Germany what happened got rained on for three weeks which is what it's been doing here I don't know what's up with the German weather but send the request and we've got a 200 back which means it should have gone through now we can head back over to make.com successfully determined great that means it's received our information we can go continue now we need to create the Google sheet that's going to click this information so we can go over to sheeter we're going to create a new sheet and we can call this incident reporting and then we can do the same thing date so these are going to correspond to what you've set up on the voiceplay side of things so we have the date the names location what happened so now we have all of that we can head back over to this you need to connect your Google account it'll prompt you to do that then you click on the spreadsheet ID and we can go to or is it incident reporting which has popped up here all nice sheet name just sheet1 is fine then we can go continue then you can click on this again and now we can start to actually assign the values here so the information we sent from voice flow is going to appear here so you can see all the different ones that we've ascent and the body so if we go back to this all of these bits of data that we sent as the body of our post request has now popped up here for us to populate the different fields with within our spreadsheet so we have the date we can line up with that we have the names you can put as people I've had a bit of a mismatch here a location nice location of course and this one I take it is going to be what happened that hasn't come through yet but yeah that's all set up and we can actually start to test this thing so we can turn the schedule on and now we should be able to Ping this thing again head back send a request go to Liam home fun send request okay and so to make sure this is running non-stop in the background you need to turn your scheduling on so you need to flip the switch here and the settings should be immediately as the data arrives then you can head back to the home screen and then we can see here if we pop back over to our request we can hit resend and it's going to pipe play a new one here and we can resend it's going to populate a new one here so this means every time we run a new request through this it's going to process it it's going to add up to the sheet and then we can say a little bit of information back to the user so if it succeeds we can say text thanks for submitting report in a fail so we can say fail so please try again okay so now we can actually give this thing a spin maybe we should do it on WhatsApp as well let's try to do that so I can send a test on WhatsApp report and incident okay is there an emergency no there's not oh this isn't formatted very well and WhatsApp might need to tweak that but last on the 10th of August James and I were walking and the car of C block and the floor broke which made us fall down and badly scrape out legs so we've given the information now it's going to process that and hopefully we see oh there we go we've got the information that's been put over to the sheet now again as I said this needs to be a little bit more prompting done to make sure this is extracted because all you need is the names thing so you need to do a bit of a few shot prompting it's probably going to do the job here also for the date and struggling to get the date so a little bit more prompting and information can help there did we get the C Block C block yeah topic incident that happened what happened James and the and the writer we're walking Corona C block at the floor break causing them to okay so now we built an incident reporting feature into our chat bot we were able to take some information from the user process it and extract some entities albeit badly at this stage and I submit there is as I said there's many improvements you can make that extraction but for the sake of this video I think it shows you the concept and you can feel free to make the edits you want on your own time but but we're able to use make.com to use a web hook and send data using a API call and we're able to send information to make.com using a post request with the variables that we extracted and then it's going to put that into a spreadsheet for us to analyze at a later date now this is just one example you can of course use this template of using make.com and sending information over and creating a spreadsheet for it and things like this so many different things you could do with once the data is inmate.com I know there's a lot more flexibility there than what zapier at least so you can manipulate the data however you want you can send it to different parts of the business but when it comes to the automation site using platforms like make that deserves its own video so at some point very soon I'll be releasing that video on it as well so if you want to cover this side of the information in terms of chatbot building and then also the automation side be sure to subscribe to the channel because that's coming very soon okay so with that feature added and I think we're pretty happy with pulling an end to the staff training chat bot for now we took it from a basic chatbot with just a loop were you able to ask questions about the knowledge base and now now we've taken it to having an intent classifier and building in just one feature of many that you could potentially build out this is again just to show you the potential of this kind of technology and we've used for the first time connecting to an automation platform via a API call or a get request post request and we've sent information out of the chat box so that we can manipulate and do cool things with it elsewhere and we've shown you how to do a quick and dirty deployment to WhatsApp so that you can test it within a live environment you can send this out to your client and get it tested and whatnot so happy with this as it currently stands again you can get this template available on the resource Hub which is going to be available in the description so feel free to grab this download it import it to voiceplay I think is an import feature in the top left on my reasons Hub when you download this it's also going to be a little video on how you can upload this so once you download the file for my resource Hub you need to upload it so you can start using it so there'll be a video on the resource hub for that but for now let's get into our final chatbot which is on lead generation okay now we can get onto our final chat bot which is going to be a lead generation chat bot I wanted to include this one to give you all a very broad range of different applications you can use chatbots for so first off we have customer support which can handle a ton of different use cases then we have a staff training chatbot which is a good example of the point to WhatsApp and then finally we have this lead generation chatbot which really can provide the most value to a business in a lot of cases if you set it up right and now it's important to understand the concept behind this and why we're doing it and how we're actually going to generate leads with a chatbot like this so the idea behind this is we're going to create a chatbot that has specific knowledge within a specific industry and with that specific knowledge we're going to put it into a chat bot and make it freely available to people be it through our website chat bot or on maybe a Facebook messenger chat bot or even Instagram DM chat bot for a business there's so many different places that you can put it but the idea is that you have some interesting information that's specific to a user's problem and you're going to allow them to get access to that information and basically speak to an expert on the topic and they can ask the questions back and forth hey maybe they're looking to buy something maybe they want to know more information about a certain area you're going to give them access to that but in exchange for giving that free information away you are going to be dropping ad placements and in this case it's going to be lead captures throughout the conversation every three to five messages we're going to be dropping our own lead capture method so that when they're mid conversation we can be pushing our own products and really the key thing here is that if someone is interacting with your specific chatbot for the business that you're working with they are obviously very very interested in what they have to sell or the information regarding the niche they are a warm audience they have shown interest and intent to get information and potentially be a customer to some kind of service provider in the niche so your goal is to get the people on here get them chatting back and forth with it and then start to push them and say hey look by the way we're actually experts and we can help you with this or we have this resource that you can get click through here to get it or you can book in a call with us and have a chat to us Etc so that's the concept in this case we're going to be doing it on solar I've created with chat gpt's help and ebook resource I think this is a good way to go about it if you create some kind of comprehensive ebook or specific knowledge and put it into a document and in this way we're going to chop it all up and put it into our knowledge base and that's going to cover all the bases and people are going to be able to ask questions about the solar ebook that I've created and the solar e book is specifically for single-family homeowners who are interested in getting solar for their house the idea is that this Smith solar fantasy company that I've created has this chat by putting their website or maybe on their Instagram or something like this and when people come on they can chat to it and they're going to learn about how they can get solar for their home and it's specifically for residential solar and they get to ask questions about financing about the Best Brands about the best installers and things like this and every couple of messages we're going to be shooting in our own lead captures and things like that so that's what we're doing here you can see firstly the knowledge base of course is going to be the most important part of this at the beginning here is the knowledge base here it is about a massive ebook a decent sized thing that I've gone back and forth for chat gbt to generate and this includes things like why consider solar energy for your home evaluating your solar potential basically all the things that someone in this Niche could ask about we're going to have information in the symbiota provide value to them so it's important to have the knowledge base as a sort of comprehensive package of information that is going to be specific and useful to the people who are going to be using it so to get started we need to head over to our newest button we can type in lead gen and we're going to build an AI assistant of course once we're inside first things first we need to set up our knowledge base I've already got things set up here so I'll just delete that same sort of process what we're going to do is go add data source we're going to click on the doc we're going to select our document for these examples we're just using one but you can of course add a ton of information in here unless it just for Simplicity of the tutorial if you're doing the staff training chat what you can just cram that full of Staff training resources for this case if you want a broad knowledge base on a specific Niche you can start it full of any documents that your client has you do need to do a little bit of prepping though to make sure that it hasn't got a bunch of rubbish in it but the idea is you can put a ton of different ones in here so in this case I'm going to put my solar document in give that a second to load in and then we can go to our settings up here as always I'm going to be using Claude V1 here turn the temperature down a little bit Max tokens can probably stay around there and then we have the system prompt which is very similar to the other ones this is for a guy called Nick who's our solar energy assistant AI your mission is to help a single family home owners understand everything about solar energy enabling them to make the best decisions for their specific needs my name is mentioned things about the context Snippets that you're going to be provided with Etc and instances where the query Falls outside of your information or ability you should guide homeowners to seek advice from a qualified professional in such cases direct them to Smith solar speak to an expert page with a clickable link using the markdown format like this so this is going to be providing links to Smith Solas speak to an expert page I try to make these Legion chat Bots kind of unaffiliated if possible because there's nothing that puts a prospect off like instantly bragging about how your businesses so in this case you can tell I've said you're just a solar energy assistant AI you're kind of just helping them your goal is to just help them get the information they need not to be pushing products really hard but then when it comes to speaking to an expert you can gently sort of nudge them towards it because we don't need the Chapel to be selling selling selling because eventually we're going to have our own ad placements that are being put in there and those will do the selling for us so again this prompt is going to be available on my resource Hub if you haven't got it and also the entire template for this chatbot going forward so we can save that we've got a knowledge base set up and then we can head back so this looks very similar to the the prior ones we've done just a little introduction hi I'm Nick I'm an expert on solo for single-family homes what would you like to know and we're going to go through the same sort of process which is to capture the user input listen for capture and then we're going to catch the entire user reply in the last utterance variable and then we want to do a response AI block pop that here connect this down here then we want to use the knowledge base and we say of course transfer users question let me go last utterance so we can preview this if we go what is the best way to finance solar based on the information provided this is a common issue that you'll see with custom knowledge chatbots which is they mentioned that you're providing them with information this is an important thing for us to go over actually I'm glad that this has come up so I'd say based on the information provided there are a few good options for financing your solar system so we don't really want this AI to be saying hey I've been given a bunch of information we just need it to speak as if it knows it like that's what it actually knows so you can prompt the living hell out of this thing to try to get it to stop doing this I believe I've already put it in twice you guys never refer to these Snippets in your answers all the info given you should be repeated as your own knowledge and then I do it at the end okay so I've done a little bit of trimming on the on the knowledge base prompt here I've added in well you must never refer to these Snippets in your answer I've also said but you must never refer to this information directly in your answer so maybe we can save this and try it again it might actually be a voice flow related thing whether they're injecting a little bit of prompting into it themselves when they're running their own knowledge base so let's just give this a spell and Steve's question preview what's the best way to find it so long let's see what it says okay it's still doing it we might need to get a little bit more strict on this guy this is really strange if I can put it at the bottom here you must never say things like based on the you provided or similar never refer to the N4 formation right like you know all information yourself so this is actually some good stuff for you guys to be seeing behind the scenes because you're going to run into this a lot where it's not quite giving you the responses you want let's try it again there we go the best way to find it solo and it just goes straight into it so there's a little trick that you can do with prompting and sort of for every Cutting Edge stuff that we've been working with the Morningside and reading it out of some scientific papers but there's a thing called getting lost in the middle when it comes to prompting where depending on the size of your prompt if it gets really really big the stuff in the middle actually gets kind of lost and the instructions in the middle aren't noticed as much as the ones at the stop at the start and at the end so as you can see I added some stuff sort of in the middle there and it wasn't listening but if you slam it at the bottom it's definitely going to take a lot more notice of it and that's a general rule with prompting as well is that the longer the prompt get the more bloated it is the more fluff you have within your prompt the less notice it's going to take at the specific point so if possible make it direct make it short my one's very very long here I could definitely do some work to tidy that up but it is quite a long process it's literally like writing like copywriting or doing a really really specific writing task and being very very precise with your words for the sake of spinning output things like this I find this prompt does a good job but when it comes to a specific client and you really want to dial this in you should go back to the drawing board and plug things out and very very carefully lay out your goals for the chat bot and how you can instruct it on those things very very carefully and keeping in mind that the very first thing you mentioned in the prompt and the very last thing are going to be taking the most notice of and the stuff in between may not be looked at as much that's a little bit of extra sauce for you guys when you're doing your prompting as we can see that's solved the issue for us here so we've got the setup now we just need to reconnect this Loop up to the top and then we have a bit of a prototype let's run this run this test hi I'm Nick I'm an expert for solar and single family homes how can I help you I'm interested in solar but I'm not sure about if it's worth it in the long run solar energy is absolutely worth in the long run for most homeowners here are some key reasons why environmental benefits energy cost savings Etc so this is quite a long answer and as you can see it's actually been cut off due to the Token limit within the knowledge base but this does look like a lot because we're doing it within the little skinny editor but if you put this out onto the prototyping page it would probably fill out a lot more and look a little bit better you can add something at the Ender at the top in order to prompt this thing into putting out shorter responses so that's all good there we've got a little prototype running maybe ask it one more thing we say what is a PPA a power purchase agreement or PPA is a financing option for residential solar panels okay great now you may be thinking this is just a custom models chat bot what's the difference between this and what we've just done in a real business if you're working with a real client and you wanted to prototype this what you can do is include links into the knowledge base a lot more often because this is a dummy business we don't have the links to put in but when you're working with a real client you can include links to the the checkout page or the book A call Page Etc all the kind of products that they have available and things like this or even just a link to the page on about us and about our services and why we're experts or something or you can even be doing blog posts and things like that if you want to learn more about this specific side of solar for residential is a great article that we've found that kind of warms them up to the idea of working with some solo so in this case when you're just running this basic one and we haven't got the sort of manual ad placements that we're going to set up in the advanced version and your property you can say something like you're supposed to help them to learn more about solar for residential homes your end goal is to help them come to a decision about whether they do or don't and each of your answers were possible try to point the user towards Smith solar as being the ideal provider for their needs that they can really help them to get what they want then as they go through the conversation they ask about who's a good provider they can say hey by the way Smith soul is pretty good here's the link to book and a call or hey I'm interested in figuring out more about installation costs and say well if you want to learn more about installation costs so a solo actually Stacks up very very well against the competitors we have very competitive pricings on this system this if you want to book in a call or if you want to schedule a consultation here's how you can do it okay with the basic one out of the way we can jump into the advanced one now the first thing we need to do is set up some variables you can click on the nlu model at the top here here you have drop downs for different entities Etc what we want to do is add some variables in you can click the plus button here what we want is to have is just sent we can create the variable as you can see I've already made it but I won't have that error for you and then we also want to have router same sort of capitalization you can have lowercase on the first word and then each additional word is capitals after that at the first letter we can create this as you'll see I've already created it so you've got these two new variables what you want to do is when we start off the chat bot here we can put a set step in and we want to set up variables apply to the add router I want to set the add router to B1 and we're going to add another set I want to set the message of sent to zero not always necessary to do this but I do like to just make sure everything's set up at the start of every chatbot correctly okay and the next step is to grab this JavaScript block and put it here what we're going to do is go messages sent and then just type space plus plus this is going to add one message to the message Ascent variable so this is just a counter variable that's going to calculate the number of messages that we've sent it's going to keep track every time we send a message it's going to add one more and then we need one more block just to test this thing out so we can set a conditional if block here which is going to be check for trigger number of messages so this is going to say if the variable which is the message sent if the number I've missed send is three then we're going to want to do something and then we're going to have an else which is a no match so we can add a path if this is not true we're going to go back up here and then we're going to come over here if it is true so we can add a torque step I'm just going to say add triggered okay so you may be wondering what the hell's going on here we've set up these two variables of adrollter and the mess descent add realtor is going to be the variable that manages what ads people see and when and any number of messages sent is just to check how many messages have come through so that when it hits a certain number in this case we're going to make it every three messages then we're going to push and add placement in and then continue the conversation so we can run this and it should have the debug window on the side here you can pull this out let me just get this thing out and then we're going to be able to see our variables on the side here which is very handy okay so when we run this thing we can watch our messages sent on the side panel here look hi Nick and we're going to see our missed descent increase by one don't let this put you off you haven't actually set up any buttons this is actually just a setting in the guided navigation so if you turn this off and you won't actually see those things so this is going to stop and wait and give you buttons on the earth step so you can really control it so if you run this again say hi Nick and you see our messages sent will increase by one now the ad router is still set at one and we can go what is your name my name is Nick I'm an expert in single family homes what is solar so the ad was triggered which is because you sent the message we've also sent ours and so we sent ours it added one to the message here and then it sent his reply and then I put it through this Earth conditional block again and because we'd hit three messages it sent us over to the add browser so this is all working as expected so now we have the opportunity to start to place ads in front of the user as they're going through so now we're going to build out all of the content for that side of things so what we're going to do is have three different ad placements I'm going to plot them all out now each of them are going to start with a little JavaScript so we can pop this JavaScript one here oh I can install this so we need to go messages sent equals zero then we need to go add router equals in this case it's going to be two don't worry too much I'll explain this in a second paste this again paste this again rename this to add one add two add three so we're clear and now this one needs to be the add router set to two and this one needs to set the ad router to three and this one is to set the ad relative back to one so this is just the corresponding ad so after we see the first ad it's going to update the ad relative variable so it's going to be relative to the second one so it's basically just cycling through every time it shows an ad it's going to change the ad that's going to be shown next a little bit more Logic on that is coming soon okay to start off the first ad which is going to be placing an ebook in front of them that they can download and in exchange for the email or their phone number so we're going to have three different ads in this case I'll show you the complete version over here which is going to be one an ebook that they can click through to and claim secondly it's going to take them to a solar savings calculator which is going to have a lead capture on it as well and then finally we have add three which is just going to be a traditional lead cap so it's going to ask for the email or their phone number then we're going to take that phone number and email and put it onto a Google sheet so that we can track them later and do things with them so those are each of the ads we need to add in our card first there we go this title is going to be claim your free ebook we're going to browse this I have a little image made for this that I whipped up residential solar so you can add all your own images in here I'm going to provide these all on the resource Hub as I've mentioned so if you want to get any of these and follow along you can I'm going to add a description to this as well so a little line under it so this is going to pop up as a cool little card within the chatbot and then we can go a button we can say claim yours so they can claim it for free is the idea and then we want to open a URL I'm going to do my Liam otsley.com then we're going to add in another card down here as we have done before what else can I help you with generate let's get a couple different versions of that anything else I can help you with yeah sure that sounds good yep generate more and then what we're going to do is write from this link down here over to this so this is going to be the home base we can go this back to main loop as we've done before maybe give this a nice little color because I'm feeling happy and then we can take this and send it back to our main loop again so same sort of stuff we've done before just this time with some cool extra features in it we can pop this up here now we need to do ad number two which is also a card so I can add a card in here drop it below I can add in the title I can add in the subtitle and then what I can do is browse this I have it on my desktop here just a little picture of the calculator that they can use and then I'm going to add a button as well it's going to go to try free it'll be a good call to action here and then we're going to open a URL we have a URL here so this is a solar calculator by Google of course you'll be using one that your client has it's going to allow them to calculate something or some kind of tool that's going to capture the lead as well so we have that there and then we can link this bad boy back up here same as before and then we need to do our last ad placement which is going to be a little bit different what we're going to do is just add in a text block after this JavaScript block here and we can paste this in and then this is the message we want to send would you like one of our experts to get in touch with you if so what is your preferred contact method and then what we can do is have some buttons pop them down here and we can have that email and we can add another button and say phone now you can also set up an intent here so that they can type in just natural language rather than a button so you can add an intent here which is emailed as fine or do a bunch of different utterances on that so that it can identify that they're asking for email same thing with phone like you can create your custom intent here I think create a new intent do the same process that we've done before so that they can enter both by button and they can also enter by those typing in what they want to do as well so if you've got both of these set up and they're going to come up here the email we can put talk step phone we can do the same thing text please provide a valid email and maybe generate three different versions of that there we go please provide a valid phone number generate one of those just adding a little bit of variation so that if people are going through this multiple times it doesn't seem too repetitive no harm really they make it super easy just to button click and that's it okay so I've gone ahead a little bit just to make sure everything's planned out carefully for you guys one thing we do need to add in here is to add another button saying I'm okay thanks so this is basically the option for them to not give their information so we're throwing this out at them in their face and they can say hey no I'm not interested so there's buttons here if we just run this from here you can see oh it's untrained but there's three buttons here now so email phone and I'm okay thanks and I'm okay thanks we can take back to this back to main Loop thing and it's going to ask well what else can I help you with and it takes us back in order to get the entity extraction and lead capture working correctly we need to come over here we have this sort of same setup We'll be asking for a valid phone number or an email and then we come over we need to set up an entity so in order to create a new entity I should probably walk you through those steps click here we need to add a new one called email because I'll type email and then we can create this entity here so it's going to capture the email and then down here we can do the same thing where we're going to create a new entity and we're going to call this phone and we're going to make it a phone number then we can create the entity there and then now we should be good to come back through start this again need to train it I believe yep okay so we're just going to reset it from here run it now let's go email if I go hi my best email is Liam otley at gmail.com then it's going to pass through so it's correctly extracting the email I believe if we pull the sidebar out we can actually see so yes it has extracted the email correctly now we can try it again with the phone if you come up here and click on the play button start again from the top let me go by the phone route we can go okay I need a valid phone number okay let's go 301 332 and there we go actually let's run this again so the whole point of this entity extraction thing is to be able to not just provide the information that they want they can actually include it in a larger message so need to do that again so if we go along here phone I can say my best number is 303 82239 okay now it should be able to extract this phone number and we can check phone there we go it's extracting it correctly now we just need to know what to do with the phone and the email so we're going to be setting up the same sort of system with make as we've done four so what we can do is go to the templates again back over on make we can go search up webhook start a new web hook yep and then we have the Google Sheets sheet and there we go we have add data to the Google sheet for received via web hook do the same thing we can start a guided setup in this case I'm just going to add a new web click this is going to be lead YT save this and it's going to give us a link again could copy the address to the clipboard head back over to voice flow we can click on our get request here we can drop it in this and then you can set up the parameters so I've just done this a little bit at a time we can add the parameter so this is going to be email this is going to be the email variable that we created this is going to be oh we had another one this one can be phone now in this lead caps you'd probably want to get a first name and a last name or at least just a name to attach to it very easy step to add in you just put it sort of put it before this section and just make it go first you get the name then you get the email then you send it off to the to the webhook so phone and then we go phone and then we need to capture we don't need to catch anything we're just looking to send the information off so we have email and phone we have the hook we can paste in there and then we can send the request so let's put in the email liammail.com send request and then 200 code means it's gone through all good we can hop over to make and then we see we've successfully determined it we can continue I've set up my Google account already as we've done before now actually just to save the sake of more sheets I can add a new sheet down here and call this lead capture and I can say email phone obviously you want to enrich this more with that first name last name as I just said but also you can take some of the information within the conversation so you could do a little AI set AI task and you could take all of the messages that have been said during the conversation so far and summarize them down or even just pipe those straight over and send all of the transcript data from the conversation that the users have into this lead sheet as well so this means you're going to have these a first name last name email phone maybe then you're going to have a really enriched data set on what they've actually been asking to this bot and based off those questions you can very easily pass it over to the sales team or start off some personalized emails and things like this so it's like really really awesome stuff that you can do at the back of this I've kept the basic within this but I just sort of want to let you guys know you in the right direction and you guys can go and sort of brainstorm on it I will be doing some more advanced tutorials so if you want to stick around for that I'll be dropping them later probably on the second Channel at some point so be sure to subscribe to the channel and keep an eye out for the second Channel when it comes and so I can pick the spreadsheet here which was incident reporting you guys should make the correct one of course see you didn't reporting and then I can put it on the second tab of the sheet I can go lead capture I can continue and then what I need to do is probably send another one over if we go resend come back and then what we can do is click on the Google sheet here we can go we need to redetermine the data structure because I've backed out of it sorry look at searching for it we just pop back over how you know the drill now you can resend that it's going to come back in here and we can continue come over to Google Sheets Google recording okay okay and then so you may need to hit the refresh button there as I just did and then we can add the email to that and we can add the phone to that as well so we can continue there I guess the test really is to run a prop query in here and we can resend in order to test it it's working we can send the web hook and then we can click run once we can use the existing data run this and then we should have a pop over great we can just test it one more time I like to do this a couple of times if you can't tell we can run this again using existing data and we're going to pop another one and so then to make this lead capture work around the clock I can turn the scheduling on and then we can head back to the scenarios page and we can watch the data come in this one is still on we can head back over here resend and it should pop up there great okay so it's working correctly and now we need to actually test it with some real data so if I go back here click the play button I want to do an email I'm going to provide my email my email is Liam gmail.com there we go API called successfully triggered path not connected and boom there we go so it didn't have a phone it's just returned to zero but we did have an email so that's we can get a lead capture set up within your voice flow application sending over to a Google sheet and that I mean the interesting part about this is that as soon as you've got the information into your make scenario here you can do so many different things with you've got this big editor you can start to add in all these different flow controls all these different tools the cool thing is that Google Sheets in the build endle once you have this information in make essentially you've got the web of data you can start to manipulate it in all sorts of ways and really connect it to different parts of the business so I'll leave that open to you guys as I said before this is the really cool stuff once you get a chat bot as a data source and you can start to build stuff off the back of it which is what I really love doing so my final steps here is that if it's a success get out of this editor Escape what we can do is click on this drop it here add action we want to go to a block and then we can go to the back to home so after it's successfully completed we're going to send it back to home if it fails we can come down here and say failed and then we can just end here so you can walk this off and then just go to end actions end so that's how you can just end the conversation if something goes wrong but now the key part here is that we've got all of the ads set up we've got the lead capture we've got this main block as well now we just need to do the ad router every time we hit three messages we are going to be sent over to this ad router so the ad trigger that's just being sent at the moment what we're going to do is handle a bit of logic here so this is a multi-step process we're going to go if condition up here see if we can sneak this guy in can delete this maybe I'll leave it there for now actually just for debugging sake and we can say if the variable add router is one then we're going to go to block and we can go to add add one and then we can do a no match so this is an else block so if this is not met then we can add a path and then I want to go down here we want to do the same sort of thing we just create a logic step if condition actually I might just copy copy this thing paste it in here and delete this this guy on here add router then we're going to go if add router is equal to two then we're going to go to add to even that doesn't work we're going to send it down to here so add relative is equal to three then we're going to do something here no match we can just send to go here we can say something like text add browser failed let me just leave them down there then we need to change this to three add router three so if this is seemingly confusing basically as soon as it comes in we have three different ads and we have this toggle which is a variable that we're going to be editing every time we go through an ad so when the conversation starts we're going to have the ad router set to one as we do here so set add relative to equal to one that means that the first ad that's going to be shown when we hit three messages which is checked for here is going to be sent up to the ad router then we're going to check what the value of the ad router is if it's one then we're going to go to add one and then if we go to add one we're going to update the add router to two then they're going to show them the ad we're going to send them back to the main Loop they can continue to chat but we're also setting the messages back to zero so that when you get up to three messages being sent again it then goes to the add writer but this time the add writer variable is set to two and so it comes through here if the ad router is 31 okay it's not set to one else we're going to go to the no match comes down here we go to the ad writer two and then let's go okay this this checks out we have an ad router value of two then we're going to go to add to and so on then to add two is going going to set the ad router to three and it's just going to be this continual process and here we have on the lead capture the ad router is set back to one so we're counting the number of messages we are turning to the ad router to check which ad we should be showing and then we're going to be updating the advantage variable so that we're changing the ad that's shown each time now I believe we are in a position where we can actually run this bad boy and check it out in action and wrap this thing up so if we need to train anything more no hi I'm Nick what would I like to know let's just hi Nick sorry the answers are quicker if I'm not asking them a big fancy question there we go it's giving me a big answer add triggered boom and then we get the first ad so I can claim my thing and it's going to take me to your man here and then I've clicked this button it was claim your and it's going to take me back oh that should be claim yours now it's taking me back to the main Loop and it's put me back here and you can see the ad router is now set the two the messages are seen set back to one by this little bit of JavaScript up here and then we can continue to chat to it what are my financing options now the quality of these responses is going to highly depend on of course your knowledge base so here take this with a grain of salt this is chat GPT generated this isn't some secret source of the industry so keep in mind that this is not the optimal and this is definitely not what it's going to look like in practice again he's given me a big chat about how the financing options are available then we can ask them again hi Nick let's just keep them going and show some of these other ads hi Nick maybe I'll turn the debugging off so it's not bugging you guys huh add triggered boom take us to the calculator there we go we can capture the lead again and we say hi Nick again just using high neck just to get this conversation a bit quicker so I'm not sitting here for half an hour a high neck high neck and then add triggered blammo so if we hit okay thanks it's going to take us back to the main Loop but if we click on email I can go my best email is Liam at liam.com and then bam we've executed this and ideally Liam liam.com we've captured the lead as well and then ideally we can put some kind of column in here which is like transcript and we've also got a whole bunch of data on what the user's been asking about that we can use for personalized Communications we can even get the transcript and put it through a little AI function and get it too classified into different types so what kind of customer is this what kind of category within our business and our kind of uh Prospect and database could he fit into okay let's put into this team who's very good with this like a business clients really really cool stuff you can do as soon as you put in the transcript in here and then you can go back to make and you can run AI features on it and all sorts of things so that's the really cool stuff chatbots may seem a little bit stale but once you're actually providing real value to these businesses by collecting this information and then doing something valuable with it that's what this thing's all about really so that's what we're trying to work you towards but that's been the advanced lead generation bot I hope you've understood how this thing is working you can take this template and swap out the different ads that you're using you can adjust your knowledge base you can change the lead capture to be a bit more extensive asking for more information Etc but this is the gist of it now we can share the Prototype if I just pop this over here but we can also as I mentioned before let's get out of the designer here we can publish it I'm going to call this V1 I have the YT lead thing so hi I'm Nick hey Nick what why is solo good for residential and there we go so it seems a little bit better once we've got a wider chatbot window to look at this in again quality of the information probably not great because I've used the generator chat CPT to to create the ebook itself but that gives you an idea of how you could see it on a full screen share it with some clients Etc and then what we want to do is embed this widget so I can show you it on a web page if I just pop back over to this take the script tag out save it I can run this up again and now we have it down here here we have Nick hi Nick we can take a look at some of the ads in here actually let's see what they look like once you're on a web page hi Nick heck Nick hi Nick add trigger claim your free ebook there we go so what you do actually is remove this ad trigger now that we know that it is triggering correctly so you can come back over here Etc pop back to the designer and you can remove this ad trigger in that case you could redeploy Etc one thing I also wanted to point out that's outside of the scope of this video is that you can take all of the awesome functionality that you build on voice flow like this and you can use their dialog API which I'm showing on screen here you can sort of custom code this a little bit but you can create an amazing lead generation chatbot that the back end really the the functionality of it and how it's supposed to work and using all these AI features and then you can plug that into a custom front-end so if you want to create a cool lead generation website or something for one of your clients you could create a a new web page and you could stick this on and create your own custom UI and really bake it into a custom site so you use a voice flows to backend in the logic but then you can create some really really cool front-end address this lead generation chatbot up to feel more than just a little web chatty thing in the corner so I'll leave that with you there I might come Circle back and cover it in a later video maybe on the second Channel when that's all set up and running but I just thought I'd drop that in there and there's also a knowledge base API so you can query your knowledge base and not necessarily use it how they've set it up in the no Cody week you can actually call the knowledge base and pull chunks back and have a lot more control over it so that's it for the bot building guys we've really got a lot of rubber on the road here I hope you guys have hung in there and made a good effort of this or as I said all of the templates are going to be available on my resource Hub in the description so if you want to clip through to that you can sign up it's free you're going to get access to all of these different templates to download plug and play and use them how you like and with that everyone we've finished the chat by building section of this course we've collected three different prototyping methods so you have all the tools you need there to spin up something quick and really demo it and we've gone through six different examples of chat to basic customer support and advanced customer support a basic WhatsApp and staff training chatbot and an advanced one whom we've also done in a basic and an advanced lead generation chatbot so I really think we've covered a lot of ground here and now that you know everything under the sun about how do you build chat Bots the only thing left to cover for you all in this video is how can you actually start to sell these to businesses luckily you've been listening to and learning from the right guy here I do this every single day in my own businesses I run an AI automation agency which is a business model that I created as I mentioned we've been over a little bit before in the video but I want to give you a little bit more information on it now and exactly what it does and how you can start to take the skills you've created and begin to start selling packages of AI Automation Services Beyond just a little chat bot and going over to really a valuable package of of deliverables for a specific Niche so what is an AI automation agency well the official definition is this the AI automation agency model is an online business model focused on helping small to medium-sized businesses to automate their systems and processes with AI technology so a beautiful thing about you making it to the end of this video is that you've just learned basically half of the skill set in terms of delivering services for this what you need to do is combine chatbot building skills with automation platforms like we've been using with make today and zapier and things like that our job is AI automation agency owners is to help businesses to adopt this new technology and really benefit from the huge gains that they can provide so if that means to apply some of these chatbots to their businesses as new data collection points connect to different parts of their businesses finding repetitive tasks that are being done by their staff members and automating those processes and systems as well the the Bedrock that this business lies on is your ability to connect and draw a direct line as I say on screen how to draw a direct line between the product you create and the money that they're able to save all the revenue they're able to increase so it's no rocket science there's nothing crazy here you are supposed to identify a part of the business that you can improve or automate and you can draw a direct line from hey this is how many hours someone is going to be spending on this kind of thing per month based on what you've told me I can cut this down to one-fifth of that and you're going to be saving this much money so that is where you can really start to tap into providing value as an AI automation agency owner and the key to getting started and really finding success what I found from my own experience and from working with my students I have an original eight incubator program that I'm doing for free at the moment and I've also got thousands 23 000 people in the Discord as well that I'm working with on sort of a more distance basis but the key is that we've found is to focus on one Niche say you become the AI automation expert for real estate agents where you can become the AI automation expert for construction firms and things like this you focus on building out a package of things that people in this industry you know typically they're going to need and their business could benefit from and then you're able to package this up as sort of a bundle and start to offer this and this might include chat Bots it might include automation systems as we've been going through here as well but the key is to get to that point where you're able to have sort of a nice set of things you can go and be the expert at automating businesses within a particular Niche so if you're interested in learning more about how to start and build your own AI automation agency you're in the right place because I've got a ton of videos on my Channel about the specific topic book this is really all we're focusing on right now so if you want to be able to take your AI chatbot skills you've got now and convert that over into

don't need to know how to code I'm going to be creating an AI Persona chatbot of a famous YouTuber from scratch to show you how to make and sell these chatbots yourself but more importantly I'm going to be addressing a burning question within the AI automation space right now why would anyone pay five thousand dollars for a chatbot by the end of the video you're not only going to understand exactly why this is possible but you will also have everything you need to start building and selling these things yourself I'm going to be giving away the exact no code method for quickly creating these kind of chat Bots that we discovered and used regularly within my own AI automation agency which I'm totally fine with sharing with my community because I'm so confident that this Market is big enough for us to all get a slice this video is going to be broken down into a few Key Parts so feel free to skip around as you need firstly we'll be jumping into what are Ai personas and why why the opportunity around them is so big right now secondly I'll be showing you the entire process to create one of these chat Bots and just a few minutes really with no code tools and finally I'll be taking the chat bot we created and putting it to the test in my own life to prove that these kind of chatbots can be worth five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand or more if done correctly now if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I'm an online entrepreneur from New Zealand now based in Dubai but currently in Europe for the summer I have an AI development and AI automation company called Morningside AI we automate businesses both large and small with AI technology but we also build custom coded AI applications for our development clients I am the creator of the AI automation agency model or Triple A as it is known and I also own and manage the largest community of AI automation agency owners in the world almost 20 000 people in there that I'm in teaching regularly too on this channel we are all about building real skills building real businesses making real money in order to create a life you truly love living so if you're not familiar with what an AI automation agency actually is the official definite mission is that the model is an online business model focused on helping small to medium-sized businesses integrate AI technology into their systems and processes now if you're a complete newbie and want to get the full rundown on what this business model is and how I've created it you can watch my full beginner's guide here which is a two hour video explaining everything so maybe you want to watch that and jump back here so you have all of the foundational knowledge you need in order to be able to take advantage of this particular opportunity but long story short this business model is something that I've created in order to allow people like you and I our entrepreneurs who want to make the most out of this AI Revolution to be able to help businesses to adopt the technology and get paid while doing so for complete beginners you can start with something as basic as an AI chatbot template made by someone else that you can offer to businesses for free and then from there you can investigate the business and identify more high value opportunities for you to automate their business with AI and yes if you do it properly you can start to charge up to five thousand dollars or more for your chat Bots or for your automation packages as you'll see later in this video so now you know what an AI automation agency is what is an AI Persona chat bot and why is it such a big opportunity right now in its most simple terms an AI Persona is a type of chat bot that uses a knowledge base of content from a specific person in order to create what looks and feels like an AI version of that person for example if I wanted to create an AI Persona chatbot for myself I would take the transcripts from some of my YouTube videos and put that into a knowledge base to their custom chat what has access to and then I'd be able to ask it questions and it would respond as if it was myself another example could be my homozy GPT app which you can take a look at up here essentially I took 150 of Alex Modi podcasts I put them into a knowledge base and then I was able to chat to a chat bot that was an AI Persona of Alexa Modi and I was able to ask business related questions to this chat bot and get advice on my business and my own strategy AI Persona chat Bots like this are such a huge opportunity for us as AI automation agency owners because this represents a revolution in access to information on par with how the internet made basically all information freely accessible to people what these chatbots are now doing is making all of that information available at your fingertips but in a personalized and specific way what the internet did to make information freely accessible to anyone anywhere on the planet these chatbots are now taking that one step further not only is this information out there if you look for it you can now get it all from one chat interface and you can ask specific questions and have them tailored to your specific needs the most important thing about all of this is that the information can now be personalized to your problems to your situation for example I was having a conversation with my business partner last night and he was saying man I would love just to have an AI version of Alex huberman so that I could ask him instead of having to look up why am I taking the supplement how many times a day at what time of the day am I supposed to take it instead of trying to find the information through digging through podcasts or looking through blog posts he can now just ask a chatbot for it and it's going to give it tailored based on his questions so not only can he get the specific information in a second but he can ask about his specific information and the AI can respond in order to diagnose and treat what he's asking for another example of this Persona chat what's changing the way we access information is imagine if a CEO had a board of five advisors who were experts in different fields you had an AI persona for accounting and AI persona for marketing and AI persona for distribution Logistics and the point of this is that you can get access to experts in the given field and you have unlimited access to them or a more relevant example for you watching this video imagine you're an entrepreneur just starting on your entrepreneurial journey and you could have the benefit of the smartest people in the world at specific online businesses and you can ask them on how you should start your own and when you have all of the issues that pop up and starting the business you can go to them and get advice back I know that I for sure could have benefited from having something like this when I was just starting out instead of getting scammed by these social media coaches and things like that the point is that with these Persona chat Bots you can now have the smartest people in the world on your team ready to help you with any query you have and this is a revolution in the way we access information not only as the people consuming it but it's also a revolution in terms of the people Distributing this information the kind of chatbot that I'm just about to teach you how how to build it's just the beginning of an entirely new form of monetization for people with specific knowledge this means that people in Industries like coaching Consulting advising content creation tutoring all of these types of Industries and and professions really where you have a specific set of information that people want to access is now going to be revolutionized by a new way of monetizing with AI Persona chatbots people within these industries now have a way to really infinitely scale the way they distribute their information but it's still going to be in a personalized manner so one way that Alex Moore could get his information out to more people is through YouTube through writing books as he does but at the end of the day a consultation where you sit down with Alex for an hour and go over your business is going to be infinitely more valuable than reading your book and trying to apply it yourself so what these Persona Bots allow you to do is to have that information but create a personalized experience out of it and so our job as always as AI automation agency owners is to facilitate the adoption of this technology into these industries you can put anyone who is selling their knowledge currently with hey I will give you an entirely new way to monetize your knowledge with the bot I'm about to show you how to build you can go to anyone in these coaching Consulting sort of niches and say I have a new way for you to monetize your knowledge using AI people who run these kinds of businesses already have email lists SMS lists online communities and what I believe to be the next step in terms of knowledge monetization will be to have chat lists what these chat lists will be is another form or another Channel really for these business owners to communicate with people who are engaging with their content and when you add in things like running ad campaigns to your chat lists to push products and to push sponsorships you can kind of see where I'm going with this now enough just talking about it I hope you've got an idea of what AI Persona chatbots are and why the opportunity is so huge here let's get stuck straight into actually building this and getting something for you guys to start selling so first off what kind of AI Persona bot are we building and why the example bot that we're going to be building today is actually a replica of a 4 800 chatbot that we built for a client at Morningside the client himself was a marketing consultant with a a ton of written and also video content that we took took and put into his AI Persona so just to be fully transparent that was a 50 up front and 50 on a completion so I'll put screenshots up on the on screen now for you guys to see that and unfortunately because he didn't want to be featured in a video and have all the stuff shared around I wasn't on a case study rate so I'm not going to be able to show you the exact setup but it's going to be essentially the same thing but using a different knowledge base and since we can't use my clients knowledge base we need to find a new one planning for this video I really wanted to pick a knowledge base that I could use myself and really try to extract value out of these AI Persona Bots to prove to you all that there is value in these things and you can really see with your own eyes exactly the value that they provide to the end user after some self-reflection and really thinking about what I needed in my life right now and who I would want to speak to as an expert to really help me in specific areas of my life I settled on Ali abdal for his productivity expertise you may already be familiar with Ali he is a very big YouTuber who's doing very well at the moment I've been watching a lot of his stuff on productivity lately and I thought what better way of showing you guys the value of one of these chat Bots than to use his information on productivity to Revolution realize my own productivity so I've been going through a period of my life over the past six to eight months of Rapid change and really radical change in every aspect I now have a YouTube channel to manage it has grown quickly I have a Discord community that I'm doing calls with regularly and I have a development company automation agency to juggle so there's just so many changes and there's so much going on in my life my old systems and everything that got me to the point I am is no longer working as efficiently as it should I need to upgrade my systems upgrade my productivity systems in order to cope with this new workload and in order to step into my next level as an entrepreneur and so today we're going to be building an AI Ali abdal and then I'm going to try and radically transform my own productivity systems with the AI audio does help and just to be clear what I'm about to show you works for anyone as you're going along just use a different person grab some different information and put it in the same steps and you're going to have your own AI version of whoever you want I'm going to be blasting through this as quickly as possible so at any point you need to slow down you need to pause it do whatever you need to do but we're going to be going very quickly so step one is to give go to stack ai.com link is going to be in the description to sign up once you're on stack AI you need to sign up and create an account once you are in you will see this screen here you need to click on new project once we have a new project here what we're going to do is head to the llm section go to the open AI drag out the open AI node here next we go to data loaders and we need to go to documents drag in a document loader here then we're going to go down to Vector stores and we're going to grab a basic Vector Store and put it there and then we're just going to grab one more output and put it down here now when we are connecting up these nodes you're going to grab this from the input and drag it down to basic you're going to go across from here to here you're going to go from the document upload over to the basic Vector store you're going to connect the output up to the vector store also then you're going to go from the vector store up to the llm node here and then from the llm node down to the output here then you should have something on screen looking like this once we have this basic setup ready we can go to the next step which is to get our information on Alia Bell or whoever you want to use so I'm going to go to Ali's YouTube channel so I go to YouTube I search up Ali Dal I'm going to go to his channel and because I'm only interested in productivity I'm going to find his productivity playlist which is here somewhere I believe um productivity Club there we go so now I need to just pick a couple videos out of his productivity Club playlist in order to make our knowledge base so how to build the ultimate productivity system let's grab that one five essential tips for long lasting productivity my productivity systems probably be pretty good how I manage my time um 12 productivity Miss wasting your time sure we'll grab that and then we can grab this how to organize my life as well so we have a bunch of different videos here that I want to include in my knowledge base all productivity focused and hopefully this should give me a pretty good pretty good look at what kind of information he has to share with now that I've got these five videos all I need to do is get the transcript from them so we can head to YouTube transcripts generator this one here is just fine it's called YouTube transcript.com click on this and then I'm going to go through quickly take all of these URLs put them into this git transcript and then it's going to give me the transcript then once you have the transcript on screen you can just go to the bottom left here and click copy entire transcript then what I'm going to do as a Mac User is go to text edit I'm going to start a new document then I'm just going to paste in the transcript there and then I'm going to save the name of the video ultimate productivity system and I'm going to save this file call it that and then I'm going to save that to my downloads so just to keep it short on the video I'm going to go through each of these repeat that process copy the link put it into the transcript generator copy all of the transcript put it into a new text file just a txt or a word doc is fine and then I'm going to save that to my downloads ready to upload so I'll catch you when that's all done now we're back over in stack AI what you can do is click on this document upload here then all of the text files and all the transcripts that you've saved you need to locate them on your downloads then you need to click all of them select them and upload them into your document upload here now we have all our documents uploaded and they're being put into our Vector store right here next step is going to be selecting our model so this is going to be what's generating I know you guys probably don't have any any clue what's going on but I don't have time within this video to explain it all just trust me it works what we're going to do is Select GPT 3.5 turbo okay and then we need to get the prompt in order to prompt this AI into speaking like his Alia Bell now the prompt isn't absolutely crucial part to this kind of build on screen is the prompt that I'm going to be using for this chat bot an AI Persona chatbot has two main elements one is your knowledge base and a system for retrieving that and providing it as context and then you have the prompt and when you combine these two you can create a really impressive AI Persona in just a few minutes now this particular prompt is a great Persona prompt that I've been using and I created recently you can use this and you can adjust it to whoever you want so you can go into my resource Hub you can sign up in the description to get access to this prompt then you can take it copy it into chat gbt and give it a bit of information about who you want it to be instead and it will rewrite this in a way that's going to match the person that you're trying to create in your own Persona bar so what I'm going to do is take this AI Persona prompt I'm going to head back to stack AI I'm going to head up to the system message here I'm going to paste it in and there we go all of that is in there and then in the prompt box when you need to add a little bit as well don't worry about this too much but essentially it's just setting it up so that your question is going to be put in the prompt but also the information that comes from the vector store when we query our knowledge base we are almost there with the stack AI functionality all we need to do now is play around with the chunk length and how much it's going to be provided so on the side here you can see I'm changing the chunk length to be 900 and the chunk overlap to be 150 these are numbers I've played around with and these work best for our purposes you can also do the same with the vector store you want to make this up to five thousand then we're ready to start asking Ali some questions hi Ali write me a plan to optimize my work day play and just like that we are starting to get tailored responses using Ali's knowledge to our specific questions now there's actually one last thing that I want to double check and this is going to be the memory so you want to turn memory on here and we're going to change this to a sliding window and we're going to set the window size at six or seven tends to work and with all that done we can click the deploy button up here we can head to the deployments tab and then we can click the drop down here and we're going to scroll down and select our new project and we're going to click JavaScript and then we're just going to save this page here and head over to our other our front end for this chatbot which is going to be bot press so botpress.com again you can sign up in the description it's an affiliate link as well so if you want to help myself and help the channel I don't ask you guys for anything but if you want to sign up to the software there's a link in the description for you guys to use you need to of course sign up for an account first I'm just going to log in here to my account and once you've signed up the bot press you're going to be on a main screen here to get started we're going to create a chat bot now you guys are lucky because I've already done all the hard work for you I'm actually going to be giving you the exact template that I've created so you guys can get access to the template I'm going to show you how to import it so you can skip all of the hard work of actually creating this and literally just plug and play your stack AI functionality into your own bot press and you'll be ready to go so we can start from a template here let's go down we can just do a basic empty one basic empty suite and then we can go to the top left here snooze we can go to import export import from file this exact template is going to be available on my resource Hub so if you just sign up to that you'll be added download for free and follow along in the video so once you've downloaded it you can click here on the import and it's going to import it and just like that we have these three little nodes here I know it doesn't look like much but there is quite a lot of magic going on behind the scenes so just to give you a quick demo of what we're working towards here I can say hi Ali what are my three tips for a beginner to productivity and we can see what he says one start with the calendar to manage your schedule effectively to use a to-do list or task management system to stay organized three prioritizer tasks and focus on the most important ones first so this chatbot that we're building here is going to connect our stack AI functionality to a nice looking chat UI and we'll also put it onto a WhatsApp number so that I can chat to it via WhatsApp now connecting stack Ai and Bot press is super easy all we need to do is come back to stack AI we need to copy this URL here just down to the last quotation copy it over head back to our bot press and go into this first message block where it says execute code click on it and then click over to the right it's going to open up an editor don't freak out all we're doing is replacing this one line here mine's going to be blurred out of course we can paste that in there let me we can head back to stack AI again and then you need to click the show token button and it's going to show your API key once you click that it will appear here and then you're going to need to take that particular string of numbers copy it over head back to bot press and then after the bearer word here and you'll hit it you're going to replace the string with your information it's going to be XXX when you receive this template but you paste that in there instead and you should have this updated endpoint and the XXX is going to be replaced with your API key now we need to repeat this process one more time so we can just copy this endpoint again copy it X out of there and go over to this main Loop and click the execute code and do the same process copy delete it sorry and paste it in and then we need to go back to stack AI get our API key again and then come down and paste in our API key instead of the XXX and so with all that done we are ready to give our app a test what we can do is come to this part here we can hit the refresh button and we can start chatting with our bot so in my case I say hi Ali what are you famous for can you help me make a better productivity routine what is step one so as you can see we can have a conversation with him he's answering nicely but one thing here I want you to notice is that see this is no credits node off to the side this is actually a cool little feature I've built in which is gives you a hint of the kind of functionality that we actually built into my clients chat bot which is keeping track of the number of messages and then asking them to buy more if they need them what we have here is a conditional check so every time you send a message and it sends a response before you're allowed to send another message it's going to check if the number of messages that you've sent is greater than five so in this case let's just make it two and it's going to edit that and then we can run this again and you'll see what happens when you run out of credits so I can say hi Ali I need help with my email productivity I am wasting too much time in my inbox and then because we've already sent two messages it says oops you've run out of messages please come back tomorrow okay you're going to get free credits every day or buy more below then if I click buy 10 more messages it's going to take me back to the main Loop and I can continue to talk to them then he says thanks for purchasing now where were we so I can continue the conversation as I was that's just a little feature that I built in to show you guys what you can do within bot press and give you an idea of where you can take these things if you're going to put in a little bit more effort so I can actually deploy this now and show you what it would look like on a URL so we can chat to it outside of Bob press this is super simple to do all you need to do is Click publish in the top right give that a second and once that's been published successfully you need to go back to your Bot press dashboard and click on your chat bot and you can go up to the top two Integrations and you should see this web chat screen if not you need to go to the browse button here and click on web chat then once here you can do a little bit of customization I've already filled this all out for the sake of the video I'll put a little video on the resource Hub showing how I've customized this and how I've set things up pretty basic to do but once I've filled all the information out I've turned on the integration then I can click here and copy this shareable URL go to a new tab and there we have it in just a few minutes we've created our own AI Persona chatbot of Ali abdall in this case it's put onto a URL I'm able to chat to it within a web browser and get the information I need now there's one more step that I'm going to do off camera here I'm actually going to put the tutorial for it on my resource Hub so if you want to know how to do it you can check that out in the description below but I'm basically going to take this and use the bot press integration with WhatsApp bot press is great because it has a number of different deployment options here in the screen we have WhatsApp so I'm going to do that off screen and then I'll show you the result in a second sorry to interrupt the video guys but I have a really important thing to ask you all as you may know I am currently running my free AI automation agency incubator called the original eight we are in the process of doing that right now and from my calls that I'm getting on every twice a week with all of these guys I'm learning very quickly that there is a significant sort of technical hole that many of you have and in my experience of talking to these original eight people on the calls having a sort of technical advisor and having someone to talk back and forth with has been the most helpful thing for them they have all the ideas they have all the enthusiasm but they just don't have someone to bounce the idea off and that's the main role that I've been doing within the original eight is being that technical person to bounce ideas back and forth with so I'm currently brainstorming a bunch of solutions for you all in terms of how I can best help you guys make that bridge and get the technical help you need not necessarily building things for you but letting you know if it's possible the kind of ideas you have for Automation and also guiding you in terms of how you get prototyping yourself for low Code and low code tools and you guys know that I don't charge anything for all of my information I've never asked you guys for a dollar but in this case I feel like I may be harming our community and harming you guys progress by not having some kind of option that allows you to get the help you need so I want to get your feedback as my community on if this is worthwhile for you so if you want it and if you are willing to pay some sort of money in order to get the technical help you need I can definitely set up some kind of system where you can get the help you need at on demand release I'm only going to offer something like this if you guys are absolutely certain that this is going to be helpful for you so there's going to be a link in the description to vote on A4 and only if the results are overwhelmingly yes in favor of you guys wanting to get some kind of technical help from experts being able to speak to someone to bounce ideas off and get detectable help that you need I'm more than happy to put together something for you also please if you want to help me and help the other people on this channel be sure to go down and click the link in the description is going to be a four please vote on that and hopefully we can get something going if you guys want so I've successfully deployed our Ali abdall Persona bought onto WhatsApp I now have his number technically and I'm talking to him on WhatsApp I also have it on my phone so I can go out and still chat to him now comes the real test of me putting this technology and putting this particular Persona to the test and trying it in my own life so over the next day or two I'm going to be using this sort of religiously in order to improve my own productivity rebuild my systems and very soon you're going to see the before and after of that and and the results so I'll catch you guys in a few days so we are back about 24 hours later I've spent the past day working closely with Ali and really reshaping my entire productivity system I'm going to be quickly taking you through the changes that I've made with his help and the kind of experience that I've had while working alongside them so in order to analyze the value that I've been able to extract from this we need to look at the before and the after from honestly before state of my productivity systems was not really uh that great it wasn't that impressive but it wasn't really up to par for the kind of businesses that I'm running now and the amount of volume that I'm doing in terms of my community my YouTube my business as well there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done and I honestly don't think it was sufficient for the needs that I have currently prior to now the only productivity systems that I had really was my own personal notion which had some note-taking abilities and project management and also my Google Calendar which was just linked up to my calendly so Google Calendar was not optimized in any way it was purely just open free-for-all feedback to bookend and do Morningside calls and things like that and then my personal notion I was using sporadically and not really getting the most out of it and hadn't built it into a proper protocol for using it and getting the most out of it hey everyone this is me Jessica couple of days later I thought I'd show you guys briefly how far you can take these chatbots if you're willing to put in a bit of extra work I have two ad placements here that you'll see just in a second but I've also got a login sequence as well so just to give you an idea uh here's a login please provide your email they provide the email next your password which is just a dummy password for now but we start to come down and have a chat and then bang we have our first product placement now Ali is actually releasing a book if we go here you can see his book landing page so this is how you can start to sell products for the particular Creator or coach within the chat I've actually got another example in the chat here of his courses so you can also put a second ad placement so here's ad placement one I've just got this set up here and then I've also got a carousel with all of his courses but I wanted to give you guys a bit of a look forward into the future if you were to build this out and you could start to sell products for your creators within their chatbot the first thing that I did with Ali was ask him okay what's the first step if I wanted to completely change my productivity system then improve them what's the first step and he gave me back a list of requirements firstly what are your main goals and priorities one of the biggest challenges and obstacles you face when it comes to productivity what tools or apps are you currently using if any how do you currently manage your tasks and schedule and are there any specific areas of productivity that you want to focus on more so I gave them back answers to all of those and from there I got a very actionable and helpful first sort of set of step to do so I'll put these up on screen somewhere here but basically I've taken all of those and I've gone out and gotten a bit of feedback from them but put them all in place the first step in this was actually to plan my calendar ahead of time to block out my workbox and have a visualization of the ideal day and my ideal week so that I know where I should be and when I'll put a little before and after of that on screen now so you can see the difference but the key thing here was that I was able to go back and forth with the Persona bot and ask it if what I was doing was most suited to what my needs were right so it's personalized and that it's not just generic information on a YouTube video that anyone can watch and try to apply I was able to Workshop it with them and say hey I have these needs what do you recommend when should I squeeze in my admin and things like this so it's really really helpful the next thing that Ali recommended I improved was my email email system so I've switched over to superhuman which you may have heard of which is a email software that aims to really speed up the process of managing your inbox so I've set up my superhuman and I'm going to be doing that from now on which I'm really enjoying beyond that I've also used Alia abdall's own YouTube content production management system on notion so I've got that all set up you'll see that on screen now very happy with that and my team have just been getting onboarded into using it now and the final set that I'm still working on right now is actually how I can consume content better so I've started this off with a recommendation from Ali which is Castro for podcast so I can get all my favorite shows and I can sort of schedule them up and and plan how I want to listen to them in a more structured way and probably my favorite thing that I've set up thanks to all these help and what I think will be the most useful for me over time is actually a thing called rescue time which is a a complete productivity tracker for my Mac so I'm going to be getting analytics back essentially on what I've been doing over the day this is very helpful some of you who are entrepreneurs also or working for yourself you will know that sometimes you get through the entire day and you don't really have some kind of audit or analytics on what you've been doing and being able to say yes I did three hours of solidwork on my video planning or things like this so I've just set that up and I've been able to identify different tasks and how important they are so this is going to be a very good way for me to have the finger on the pulse of my own productivity and continue to analyze and improve over time now I'm actually really happy with how things have turned out so far with this I'm actually more excited for the ongoing aspect of it where I can get all this information technically from his YouTube videos and I could just go click click and edit and put it all in one by one but it's the ongoing the feedback right so when I get a problem say hey Ali my my scheduling isn't working I keep running over my time uh do you have any tips on that is when it becomes valuable because that's when it is personalized to me and instead of just asking a YouTube video and not being able to get those answers and trying to figure it out I can get it all synthesized into a nice answer perfectly for me and so with that kind of case study in front of you I hope that you've now been able to get a better answer and understanding of the original question of this video which is why on Earth would anyone pay five thousand dollars for a chatbot you can see just how much value myself as the end user was able to extract from it and throughout the process we're not talking away from that message kept popping up buy 50 more messages for 25 and I kept hitting it so you can only imagine how much value would then go back to the Creator and how much volume they could be doing with their huge follower base like someone like Ali hats this of course was just the start of the kind of monetization you can do with this as I said it is a V1 prototype but I hope you can see that if you were to charge so five thousand dollars that would be because them as a Creator or the MSC person with a specific knowledge could charge about 200 a month 100 a month to the end users and that would definitely pay back the five thousand dollars you're charging them so if you're selling a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars essentially they are paying you five thousand dollars to set them up an entirely new and exciting way of accessing your knowledge and monetization stream and that's going to be feeding back to them and bringing them thousands even tens of thousands of dollars per month so that's the math where it comes down to why five thousand dollars for a chapel like this would be worthwhile to someone who's looking to buy it like Ali Abdullah now if you can't tell I'm extremely excited about this opportunity so much so that myself on the Morningside team are actually working on a platform for this kind of thing and you guys be home more about that in the near future out but that's about all for the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you've gotten something out of this I've been able to see this new opportunity as the exciting New Frontier really of AI and how we access information that you guys can start to use this exact thing but I've shown you guys in the video and as I said there's all the resources in the video for say WhatsApp deployment our custom styling is going to be available on my resource Hub which will be in the description so you can click through to that get access to all of my AI automation agency resources including the ones mentioned in this video and please if you are part of my community and you want to help me do the things that can help you the most as I mentioned earlier in the video I'm doing a poll so that you guys can let me know what kind of things are going to help me the most so I need to get your pre back so please drop down there and click the link in the description for that and beyond that if you're not already in my AI automation Community we have 20 000 members in there now uh you can join up in the description and also join my AI automation ages and newsletter where I'm giving you my personal notes and on and learnings really from myself running my own AI automation agency people are loving that at the moment so if you're not already in my community and on my newsletter be sure to sign up to those also subscribe to the channel leave a like if you haven't already it'd mean the world to me

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be explaining how you can structure your AI automation agency offers in order to generate juicy monthly recurring Revenue in the form of retainers there are a number of ways that you can achieve this but if not done carefully and in the correct way the golden prize of monthly recurring Revenue can quickly become a dead weight in your young business and really cause you more headaches than it's worth so I thought I'd come on here and share with you some of my honest learnings and pitfalls of running retainers on my own AI automation agency so that hopefully you can avoid some of the mistakes that I've made along the way now to properly explain retainer offers for AI automation agencies I've broken this video up into a few different parts so if you want to skip around them as you need feel free to do that firstly I'll be very quickly going over what retainers actually are and whether you even need them in your AI automation agency then I'll be taking you through a few different types of AAA retainer offers that I've seen work best then we'll be following that up with four common retainer mistakes that you need to avoid then I'll be giving you guys a look into my own company and the retainer only variation of the AI automation agency model that we've been running recently now before we go any further if you're watching this and going what in the hell is an AI automation agency be sure to check out my beginner's guide here this is a two hour long video that I created we've had some insane feedback from it the likes and comments on it as you can see on screen here have been ridiculous so that's really my marker of whether or not this video is valuable that video will be linked up here if you want to go and watch that now and then you come back to this and you'll be ready for this information and I do want to briefly show some of the results coming out of my community just a week after I released that video these people are using the exact method that I covered and gave away for free and that to our video and they're seeing the kind of results on screen within their first week of starting an AI automation agency model so if you want to get started go watch that video and then be sure to join my community to get the resources that they've had access to in order to get these results so firstly what are retainers and do you really need them in your AI automation agency well if we ask Dr Google we get an official definition here of retainers are structured agreements in which the client agrees to pay a specific amount of money to a business usually monthly and in return receives a set of services during that same time period so what does that actually look like in a business well firstly it's going to be a month-to-month agreement maybe you're signed on for just a month at a time but it might be sort of a ongoing for six months so a six month contract month-to-month retainer where you're getting paid a fixed amount of money every month for doing a fixed set of services essentially you are going to be providing a set of services in exchange for a fixed monthly fee for example you might get one thousand dollars per month from your client for doing XYZ Services now the key thing here is that if you have clients on retainer within your business you are generating monthly recurring revenue or mrr you'll be seeing mrr pop up a lot throughout this video so here's a very basic diagram of how retainers work so say you sign the client in May on a one thousand dollar per month retainer you're going to collect that payment at the start of the month and then every month from then on until they cancel you're going to be paid one thousand dollars per month so in this case this business is generating one thousand dollars in mrr now what is the relationship between retainers and the AI automation agency model that I've created by default the AAA model does not include retainers the way that I've created and structured this model means that you don't have to have retainers at the start it just actually works better at the start as you're going to see later to not include retainers so by default it doesn't have retainers this isn't something like smma where everything is basically built on retainers this is more of a contract based initially and then retainers are sort of extra icing on the cake as you're going to see later in this video now for example if your AI automation agency deliverable is a prospecting chatbot for restaurants you might be charging up front a one-off setup fee of 997 dollars now it is completely fine to set things up in a way that the client no longer needs you and then you can walk away and get straight onto your next client but if you were absolutely set on getting some kind of mrr for your business there are options that do exist for squeezing more money out of each client now before we get into explaining the different types of retainer offers for automation agencies we need to answer the question of do you actually need retainers to succeed as an automation agency owner in order to properly answer the question of whether or not you need retainers to succeed as AAA owner we first need to look at why you'd even want retainers in the first place firstly mrr is the lifeblood of small businesses like AI automation agencies it's what keeps them afloat when times are tough as I've put on screen mrr creates a cushion of safety that keeps the machine going keeps your business moving forward even when times get tough if your business only relies on those setup fees then you're going to potentially have huge months followed by absolutely nothing so by having some kind of recurring income that you build up over time you can increase the Baseline and ensure that even if you have a complete flop over one month and you aren't able to get any new clients because you're on this hamster wheel or something happens you need to travel or something pops up at least if you stop trying to sell you're still going to have some kind of income coming in each month so your Baseline has increased when you have some sort of Mr also by having retainers you can actually increase the lifetime value of your client so instead of just getting a 1 000 upfront setup fee that client could now be worth up to two thousand dollars because they've got a couple months of retainers after that it can be a little bit complex for beginners but essentially by increasing their lifetime value you can afford to spend more in order to acquire that Customer because you've got this total amount of money that they're going to be worth eventually another reason why you might want to do retainers is because it can be very profitable if you you've done it right if you have the right team set up if you know what you're doing and you structure the contract and the fees in the right way so it can be very profitable if done right and the final Point here which kind of circles back to that cushion of safety is that having some sort of MRI in your business or retainers clients that are on retainers is going to give you peace of mind as the business owner that your bills can be paid the next month if you have any people who are on payroll you know that you can at least cover those with the retainers that are going to be coming in each month and this idea of Peace of Mind for entrepreneurs really goes back to to why we're doing this in the first place right it might sound a little bit backwards but as entrepreneurs we are trying to get to easy we want things to be easy we're just choosing to go through the hard in order to get this we are trying to build these businesses so that we can have peace of mind we can have all of the the fun things enjoy the life that we want to but we're willing to do the hard work now and by getting a bunch of retainers stacked up you're actually setting yourself up for that easy bit eventually because everything else is going to be taken care of by those fees there's a bunch of different ways you can do it but essentially that's why mrr can really be such a prized position within small businesses is because as a business owner having that that baseline or that cushion of safety can be really really the game changer between having a business that you enjoy running and you have lower stress levels or having a really nightmarish business where you're on a hamster wheel constantly I thought I'd throw in a couple little diagrams here for you guys to just be able to visualize how mrr can affect the business and how having retainers in your agency can actually affect your bottom line here's a triple A with no monthly recurring Revenue as you can see April to May to June is bouncing up and down and those sort of consistent level of income and the black line here is a trend line and here you can see what an AI automation agency that uses a couple retainers can look like and the difference it makes so the orange line here is the retainers which is sort of slowly increasing over time but sort of staying fairly stable and then you have the sails bouncing around in the same erratic way but the purple line here of the total revenue is the key thing here so you can see that rather than going all the way down to zero in June you've still got some baseline here of around 20. so in that case you can still pay your employees you can still pay yourself out of the company even and you don't have to worry about running into the red for that month and as you can see the trend line for this is obviously on a much higher gradient so over time you're going to be making more money and stacking up those dollars as you need them in the business account now we've identified why you would want retainers we can now look at why you don't need them or why you wouldn't want them at least initially so to be clear I think retainers can be a great thing for people who have enough experience and who have had enough time to really build up the systems required to manage them but initially for beginners who are servicing their first second third client I do not recommend trying to build some kind of retainer offer and for the reason it's on screen here firstly as a beginner your focus needs to be on perfecting the delivery of your main product your job as a beginner is already hard enough to be delivering this thing and doing this entirely new business that you've never done before you do not need to add things in like oh I got to calculate how often setup systems for when I'm going to be checking the client's thing and oh I've got all these obligations I have over the next month just cut all of that out focus on getting your one product your main product delivering it and moving on to the next and getting really familiar with that delivery process I get so many questions on how to structure retainer offers from complete beginners in my community and it's really sad for me to honestly see them struggling with these sort of more complex things that they should not be worrying about your job is to find one Niche and pick one deliverable and sell that thing over and over again and build up some kind of results before you even think about going out and adding these things in so please do not get distracted and do not let your lack of understanding on how to put together a retainer offer because it's far more difficult than just delivering one product do not let that from getting in the way of you signing your first client or first couple of clients secondly here for why you don't need them initially is that to handle multiple retainers without employees is actually going to be fairly difficult for you if you're a sole business owner most of you initially are probably going to be delivering these Services yourself you're going to be setting up the zapier Integrations or you're going to be creating the chat Bots and duplicating them over you're going to be doing a lot of that stuff yourself and now if you add in running the business getting clients Service delivery for the clients that you've got coming in and then also doing regular maintenance for these different clients that you've sold previously that's a lot of stuff on your plate and ideally you can start offering these retainers as soon as you have your first employees so you can set up some systems and say okay I need you to once a week check on this this will message the client it's just going to be too much on your plate as I say you always need to focus 80 of your time on sales and bringing in your business adding this big retainer thing and retainer obligation really is going to just screw up your time organization and mean that you're spending time doing things that are really not what the business needs at the current time and furthermore the amount you can charge for your retainers as a complete beginner without any kind of credibility or results to show clients is going to be too small for you to even bother with and it goes back what I just said about time management unless you're getting paid thousands of dollars a month for the stuff initially there's no way it's going to be worth more than you going out and getting your clients and getting new case studies and testimonies and results also when it comes to pricing retainers this can be a lot more complex than copy and pasting over chat bot and passing it off to a new client being able to properly estimate how many hours you're going to have to spend or your team members are going to have to spend or the usage that's going to be put on accounts and all of these kind of calculations can be really difficult for a beginner to do and until you have some kind of experience and track record of client science being able to estimate these costs was going to be very difficult and you're likely going to either get lost in the details and and put together a really bad offer or you're going to get it completely wrong and you're going to end up wasting or losing a lot of money on that retainer offer so it's difficult to price this is another reason I recommend beginners just do not focus on it and stick to selling your main product over and over and over again at start and finally I wanted to put this on here because I think this is why a lot of people I see in my community and all over the place really getting hung up on this retainer thing is that they're so used and they think AI automation agencies are smma just on AI it's not they are different and one of the main ways that they are different is that you don't need to have a retainer with an AI automation agency you have the luxury as an AI automation agency business owner you're able to come into a business and set something up basically copy and paste it over from a prior client and then still get paid a handsome amount for that which is something that smmas don't really get to do you can't go in there and copy and paste and add strategy over because you need to constantly maintain it and edit the campaigns and things like that don't think of it as a negative think of it as a positive you get to go in there with a product that you have already created and already sold charge a decent amount for it and then just go to the next one you don't have to be worried too much about trying to get these big retainers just focus on selling your product to your Niche and getting the money in that way so what are the different retainer offers for AI automation agencies so firstly I'm going to be giving away an AI automation agency retainer cheat sheet it's going to be on my free resource Hub and not only is it going to be this cheat sheet for a retainer offers but there's going to be all of my other workshops that I do within my Discord so weekly workshops on lead generation on website creation on anything you can imagine I've done a workshop on it by now there's also going to be a lot of my chat bot templates so if you want to steal my Airbnb chat bot template my onboarding chat bot is going to be all sorts of free resources and people in the community already getting a ton of value out of my resource Hub so if you want to get this and then all of my other resources it's for free available in the first link in the description if you want to get through to that so be sure to check that out at the end of the video on screen are the four main types of retained offers for AI automation agencies firstly we have a maintenance fee secondly we have maintenance and Improvement fee thirdly we have automation as a service us and finally we have a productized automation package which is a lot more advanced but something I'm going to cover at the end of the video now an important aspect of your retainers is going to be where the automation is actually set up now you have two options for this either to set them up on your clients accounts or to set them up on your own so obviously two very different ways of doing it and the retainers that you can do off these two different types are very different this includes the accounts for things like bot press for your chat Bots stack AI for any AI functionality you need and also on zapier as well or make.com whichever you're preferring to use so first off you have a basic maintenance package now this is something that a lot of the businesses you work with are going to want this is more so just a bit of Peace of Mind for them that if anything breaks or anything goes wrong you're there to help them out and ensure that everything is working as it's supposed to for a basic maintenance package I'd recommend setting up the automations on their accounts of course they're going to cover all the costs for the different platforms and then you're going to be charging a fixed monthly fee to fix any little bugs that pop up with deployment or any issues that they notice and finally a good thing about having people at least on some kind of small maintenance package is that if something comes along and they want to add a new feature to it your already there and they're ready to ask you for it so you can just quote them and say hey this is going to cost you 500 or 600 to set up and then bought me take the payment set it up and then continue the maintenance package as normal secondly in one of my personal favorites that I like to recommend to people is to have a maintenance plus Improvement package now this is sort of the same as your maintenance obviously you're going to set them up on their account they're going to cover all the costs but then you're going to have a fixed fee for the regular bug fixes and support but you're also going to say I'm going to give you additional features when they come available so if you want to offer them something that you create for say for another client say it's within the same industry for example the Airbnb thing if you create a prototype and you sell it to one client and then when you're working with another client they ask for a specific feature which is I wanted to be able to have incident reports if any damages is done within the property I want to feature within the chatbot that they can report that once you've made that for that client you can then go and offer it to all of the clients that you have on your maintenance Improvement package and say hey I've just got this new feature we've been working on it's been working really well with other clients would you like me to set it up for you for free so by this you can add a lot of value to the retainer because they're like well I can get one new feature a month and I'll recommend to set it at a specific limit so they're not expecting infinite improvements it's saying I can add a new feature in once per month for you based on what I'm working on I'm really on The Cutting Edge of this within our Niche and I'm seeing new things with the time so if either you want something so they can bring an idea to you and say hey would it be possible for us to get this you can say I can do one of those per month or you can say I'm also going to be coming with you with ideas and I'll present them to you and if you want to implement them then I can do that under the contract and there's also a little bit of extra source I wanted to give away for chat bots in particular so if you're doing an improvement in medicine service for a chat bot a lot of the time if you're doing some kind of knowledge bot where people are asking questions to add knowledge base and it's giving them back in the form of a an assistant answer that knows this information you can actually set something up so that every time the bot replies with I don't know and so they ask a question that's outside of the scope of the information that the client has provided you with and you've put into the chat bot every time it says I don't know you can trigger that using zapier to save it to a Google sheet and then you can say look if you go onto my maintenance and Improvement package I'm going to be improving your Bot maybe four times a month like at the end of every week is a good way to do it on a Sunday or something going you're going to go into that Google sheet and you'll say I'm going to take all these questions I'm going to go back and forth with you or your team I'm going to get the answers to that and then I'm going to add them back into the knowledge base you're maintaining and improving the knowledge base so that the chat bot can answer questions better and the way that you set these chatbots up typically they're not going to have all of the answers right off the bat so this is a really good way to continually improve it and charge a lot more than a typical maintenance package setting up something like this is actually very basic and I've actually covered it in another video I'll link it up here for you guys to watch that now but yeah this is a really really powerful way and a really big value ad for different clients depending on what their Niche is and what the uses of the chatbot are another way of charging retainers to your automation agency clients is to package your automation as a service so aaas it's not very nice to say but automation as a service is when you're going to be putting the automations on your own accounts and you're going to be covering all of the costs yourself so in this set it up they don't have it set up on their accounts they're going to be relying on you solely as a provider and essentially in order to benefit from the automations they're going to need to stay working with you the whole time this is obviously a far more sticky business model and that once you've set them up for the client and they're getting benefit from them it's highly unlikely that they're going to want to chop them off unless you start trading ridiculous retainers so it's going to be a bit harder to sell clients on this where you're going to have all of the access to it and as I say you're going to be asked fairly regularly do I even own this am I going to get access to the spot or this this so we'll be harder to sell but if you want to take this angle and charge it as an automation as a service then this is an option when it comes to charging your automation as a service clients you can charge them either monthly just a flat sort of two thousand three thousand dollars monthly or you can charge them on a monthly flat fee plus usage so you add a little markup on top of whatever they're using on your account or you can just sort purely by usage as well on these platforms APA bot press stack AI you get charged by usage so if you want to charge them by usage you're gonna have to track that based on whatever they're using so it's going to include some sort of support as well if you want to do this kind of package if they're going to to be paying you monthly you're going to have to provide some kind of Maintenance and tweaking for the client in that situation but when it comes to Major improvements and new features that they want added you can charge them and say hey I'm going to quote you 800 for this upgrade this is what it's going to cost you and these are the terms of the contract so you can include support basic support of maintaining it but if it comes to actually getting new things built into it then you should charge them a fixed price and then finally we have the Holy Grail of AI automation agencies which is a productized AI automation package which I'm going to be touching on later in the video which is something that we do with Morningside at the moment this is really the final form of a retainer based AI automation agency so if you're interested in hearing more about that and how we're running it and we can potentially take your agency in the future then be sure to stick around because I'm going over that the entire process at the end of the video an important point of course as I mentioned earlier in the video is the correct pricing of retainers if you get this wrong you could be stuck into something that's not going to be very beneficial for you in the long term pricing your retainers can actually be quite risky and if you're not careful you could easily start running into the red or just attach to something that you really don't want to be in some so the way that you can start to place them and estimate is by by estimating the number of hours your developer will spend per month on maintaining the software so if it's a maintenance package only you could say okay you might be spending three hours a week maximum okay times that by 4.3 okay that's roughly how many hours we're going to be spending on this or you can limit them and tell your developer you are to spend no more than two hours per week on this particular client when it comes to maintaining so there's two different ways you can do it once you have that estimate or that hard limit that you're going to provide to your developer you want to mark it up at least two to three times ideally more if you can get it depending on your prior results but you do need a significant margin because depending on the client as you'll see later you could have that suddenly double a triple in size so make sure you have a nice healthy margin that's worth your time and when it comes to billing by usage you can do the same process marking up the usage costs that you're paying on zapier and things like this marketing that up two or three or four times very very easy way to be making a nice margin on those kind of services that are ongoing so if it's by usage it's a lot easier to manage the cost and to be tracking how much you're paying and how much you need to build them so that takes a lot of the very variable cost out of it when you're bail in the buy usage rather than by the hours that you're developer spending on it just to give you an idea of the kind of prices you can charge then you can go anywhere from 300 per month for a very very basic maintenance package to one thousand dollars or more depending on what value you're packing into that package when it comes to Improvement and things like I've discussed with the chat Bots it's really up to you how much you can charge because you can really direct that value back into this thing's going to get better over time sell it as best as you can and see how much you can start charging those retainers for to illustrate these different pricing formats I thought I'd give you a couple examples so here on screen we have a say you set up a chat bot for a thousand dollars and then you're going to have a 30 per month maintenance you're of course collecting one thousand dollars and then the 300 in the month of May and then from then on you're making your 300 per month to maintain it and then if they cancel mid-august then you're not going to get paid in September so pretty basic and then same sort of deal with this if you're doing a two thousand five hundred dollar chat bot plus zapier automation package and you'll get that collected up front you're going to get the 2500 and then also one thousand dollars for the maintenance in that month and then so on from there now looking at this you can actually play around with it a little bit and this comes back to the off creation that I covered in my beginner's guide if you have these two different price points so say we have the setup fee and then we also have the monthly retainer when you have those and you're trying to sign the client you can play around with them and say hey look I'll waive this 2 500 up front if you buy today or if you buy this week so you can really use those or you can say I'll give you your first month of Maintenance because if you're a client and you're looking at this I'm already paying 2 500 to set it up I don't really want to pay another thousand dollars in that same month for maintenance so you can play around with those variables and really adjust them to create a really irresistible offer for your clients and finally here's an example of a basic 500 system setup depending on whatever you're providing the client with but then billing them by usage so here we have your 500 setup fee and then we have a usage-based billing so this is a random number 567 849 so it's variable depending on how much they're using the systems now this isn't great if you're looking to get some sort of consistent income in the business on the client side depending how much money you're really going to make but if you think they're going to be a high value client that's going to be running a lot lot of volume to these different automations you're creating then this can actually give you a really really healthy upside and a huge upside potential really for making a lot of money per month so if you can get the right client on the on a usage-based billing then you could be up for making a lot of money as well now I couldn't make a video on retainer offers for AI automation agencies without at least covering some of the mistakes that I commonly see and the mistakes that I've even made myself so that you guys can do this without making the same mistake so mistake one is accepting the wrong kind of clients onto your retainer offers now this probably isn't the most obvious thing for your beginners out there but accepting the rhyme kind of clients onto your retainer office can be a absolute nightmare that you do not want to be a part of as I say on screen here some clients can be problematic and trust me you do not want to sign on to a three or six month retainer with a client who you just can't stand to deal with so for your own peace of mind and also for the reputation of your business you need to be very very cautious about who you want to work with do not just open the doors to everyone and anyone to hop on a retainer offer with you if you're going to be getting paid and you're going to be working with them on going basis you need to be 100 sure 110 sure that these are the kind of people that are you going to want to work with on an ongoing basis and more so you don't think they have the potential to potentially go sour on you because it might be all good at the start when you're first hopping on the calls but uh by the end of the first month and the second month things could really get ugly if it's not a good relationship so be very very cautious about who you start offering these to it shouldn't be to everyone don't just accept retainers Willy nearly because you want the money need to be aware that you're going to be working with these people for potentially a long time and do the proper due diligence before accepting that deal and chatbot specifically if you combine a hard to work with client with a chatbot deliverable where the outputs are really subjective that could be a can be a very very bad mix because this person's grumpy and they're able to nitpick about the kind of quality of their responses if you can avoid getting in that situation I would seriously recommend it because chat bots on their own without having a grumpy client it can be very very hard to agree on the outputs and say yes we've achieved what we wanted to achieve with this particular deliverable and the second retainer mistake that you want to avoid is of course was charging too little you need to be making sure that these retainer offers are going to be worth your time and I know when you're first starting up you might think well 300 500 that is worth my time but if you're going to do all of that work you better make sure you're making some reasonable amount of money and there can be a lot of admin a lot of just messaging and mental clutter for you as your entrepreneur if you have two or three different uh clients who are on 300 or 500 a month at the end of the day if you've hired someone on and they're putting in a couple hours a week on those kind of projects you might be making 100 profit per client and you have to ask yourself is that worth my time is it worth the stress is it worth exposing my business to potential risk of clients going sour and having bad experiences and then wanting their money back it's just there's a huge opportunity cost as I've got on screen here an opportunity cost for you as a business owner to be dealing with these ongoing commitments that are really not bringing in that much money to the business as the business owner your job is to sell your main product and that is all you should be focusing on really if you're dealing with these kind of retainer offers and ongoing Communications with clients who are paying you three to five 500 a month it's just there's so much more upside and you get such a higher return on your time if you're going out and selling new clients and trying to get those thousand dollars fifteen hundred two thousand dollars uh upfront fees rather than trying to play around for 500 200 in profit you know it's just not worth your time unless you charge enough that it is so my point with this is that if you're going to charge a retainer make sure you're leaving plenty of room in their premium margin so that it's worth your time thirdly another mistake that I want you guys to avoid is getting into contracts that are too sticky particularly on your end you do not want to get locked into these maintenance contracts for many many months if you are going to be doing retainers you need to negotiate as ideally a month to month not something like a six month lockdown so the month of month is going to be far superior because if you want to get out of it you should be able to get out of it within a month because if it's a six month locking contract and you're making 300 500 100 profit a month whatever it ends up being locking into that for six month commitment is going to be a dead weight in your business as you scale and as you start to make more money you get more results you can charge more for your main product and you begin to upsell suddenly you're making three to five thousand dollars with your main product and then you still have to play around with with servicing and maintaining these things that are making you one or two hundred dollars a month so always make sure you have some sort of back door in your in your contract so that if you want to get out of it and if you think this is not a good use of my time or my team's time you can say hey look sorry I'm going to give you all of the resources you need to manage it yourself but I got to get out of here I I can't do this contract for you anymore long story short do not get locked into a long contract with clients unless they're paying you a ton of money if they offer you three thousand five thousand dollars a month to manage it then sure maybe that's worthwhile but if it's something small back yourself that in the in the next two three four months that amount of money that they're offering you is going to be very very small so it's a bit of a mindset thing and a belief in yourself and your future ability to generate money but just know that if you do the right steps and you're willing to put in the work those little 300 500 monthly retainers are going to be Pebbles compared to what you're dealing with within a couple months and that brings us on to our final mistake here which is going for retainer offers and trying to secure retainers too early in your in your business and too early in your in your time as a triple A owner as I always say in my videos and you guys are probably getting sick of me saying it by now but your first few clients are meant to get case studies you're not trying to bag a ton of money on these first couple of clients because you're probably going to be absolutely terrible at delivering your service you're going to have a product that's Half Baked and it's not really of massive value to a business you need to be using these first few clients to learn to further improve your product and to create case studies so get some results from your clients and use those to then go later on to other clients and start to charge them a ton more so you need to get those first few and as I say the focus of the first few clients is to get those case studies the goal in those initial clients where most of you guys are probably looking to to get now is not to build monthly recurring Revenue the goal in this stage is to learn and for you to get locked onto itty bitty little retainer contracts because as I say on screen here once you have results you can actually charge a reasonable amount but if you don't have any results you're not going to be able to charge them 500 000 1500 2 000 a month for a retainer because you don't have the results to back it up so doing it too early is going to mean you're taking these little tiny retainers that are going to distract you from the business what you really should be doing what you're selling so just wait a bit longer when you're working solo and I say here you should be focusing on sales not maintaining these clients for a couple hundred dollars a month just trust the process and know that in time you're going to be able to charge those higher retainers which are worth your time so don't get stuck into it too early you need to be patient in order to get the real money once you have some results to back up those retainers now I couldn't make a video about retainer offers for AI automation agencies without at least sharing a little bit about what we're doing at Morningside AI my automation agency and development company we have created a pure retainer variation of the AI automation agency model and I'm going to give you a bit of a look into how we're doing this now so that you can sort of look ahead and see potentially where you want to get your business in future after you've done the hard work of learning more about the model and delivering at least a ton of different clients so that you're familiar and you have enough knowledge to be able to start making this offer because it is quite difficult to do this is a pure retainer Triple H version and this is really the final form of the AAA model at the moment at least in the retainer side of things this is a first of its kind AI automation offer at Morningside automation I do have to give credit where credit is due as I always do in my videos You'll see a lot of similarities between what we do with our retainer model here and what the team at design Joy you're doing if you're not familiar design tool is a design agency where you pay an upfront monthly fee I want to say thank you to the design to a team and the guys over there credit what credits do thank you to the design dual team for putting this thing out there for people to share with this pure retainer variation you'll be charging a monthly fee at the moment I'll just sit at eight thousand dollars per month but I think we've cut it down for our beta test at the moment which are running to about 6400 this is more of an automation partnership an ongoing partnership between your business and their business where you are a automation partner and you're not doing this sort of scoping Contracting proposing there's like little cycle because when you're dealing with automations that can be fairly small and easy to deliver that only take a couple of days it's not worth spending days and days and days going back and forth over email it's better just say look you've got a lot of stuff we can do a lot of stuff we can help let's just jump into a contract like this where you're getting a ton of value from us you have people working around the clock on your on your projects in exchange you're just going to pass a monthly fee and we can work as partners from our experience of running this offer we have noticed not only a benefit for the customer and that they get a sort of concierge service where they've always got attention from our team constantly getting things built and they can sort of let us know and guide the development process without all the admin but but on our side as well by removing all of that admin and email communication and Contracting and things like that our team gets to focus on what they're actually good at the developers get to just work constantly and us as the admin team and the guys leaving the business can actually just focus on driving more sales rather than spending a ton of time on emails and stuff like that so how does this pure retainer version of the model actually work well step one is that clients need to come onto our website and purchase a subscription here you can see it's our Morningside automation website and down below is a subscription section so they can click monthly they can actually buy quarterly or yearly which aren't available right now because we're in our beta test but they can click here and apply for the beta and the final version they're just going to be able to click there and purchase it outright so from there you go on to step two which is a workshop call so after the client has purchased the subscription they've sent a link to book and they Workshop call with us and their team these calls typically last an hour or more and it's really just getting to know their business inside out and picking out all the different automation opportunities they have so we actually get the client to walk us through their business using a framework or a set of questions that we have so that really takes us from top to bottom and we can start to jot down the whole team's jotting away identifying different things we can help them out with and then they may also have some ideas themselves so we often have businesses that come to us and they say hey man I've been seeing these different things and I want to get this this involved and we go great we can put those down on the list and then we go through that framework and that questionnaire with them we also identify a ton more that they never even thought of that we know from our own experience of working with businesses like them and at the end of the call we have 10 to 20 different automation ideas that we can then go and boil down into a actionable list for them once you have that list of ideas boiled down to some actionable tasks then we create a Trello board for them and populate the Trello board with all of these different automation tasks so our developers will scope each one of the little tasks and say for this thing it's going to take three days for this thing it's going to take 10 days because it's a bit more complex and once they're all put into the cello board then the client can come on and have a look around and say yeah that one's going to take three days okay sure let's get started on that and once they drag it across and put it in the current request column then on our back end our developers are going to see what requests are being asked for and which clients are in need of work so that takes us to the next step of Service delivery we're using air table here to just track all of those different Trello boards and so whenever there's someone who's waiting for a review or they've asked for a new task to start our developers can just come onto the air table and see everything and determine which projects are currently on pause or waiting for review and which things they actually need to do work on so very easily all centralized sort of project management Hub here works very very well at the moment and we're really happy with the system that we've got set up a few more notes that I'll mention just to clarify the service delivery a little bit all communication is done on Trello via comments this is to as eliminate as much slack back and forth as possible which is a bit of a a black hole that you can get stuck in into as agency owner but by keeping all the communication on Trello includes a lot more friction right so as soon as it's on slack and other communication channels there can be a lot more chatter back and forth with comments it's a bit more blocky and a little bit more friction right so only investing us when you really really need to once you're happy with it we can move it across to a complete we can start on the next task so this basically results in more work and a tunnel less admin for us and a ton less back and forth for the client and I will mention that this kind of thing does require a lot of experience but the results are worth it and I wanted to include it in this video so that you guys can see we can get to with this model once you have enough experience obviously to to have your business come to you and you do a full audit of their operations and figure out a ton of different automation opportunities for them that takes quite a lot of experience and tied a lot of skill and a good team of developers behind you to back it up and really build those things out I seriously would not recommend it for beginners this is a very very difficult thing to do if you don't have the experience as I always say you need to focus get it as simple as possible get your foot in the door with a specific Niche and a specific delivery and if you keep at it and you continue to expand that eventually you can get to something like this and I'd love to see some of you guys do this in the future so that is your full rundown of retainer offers for AI automation agencies key takeaways here that I just want to reiterate is that you don't need retainers especially early on it's not your focus to be running up retainers early on your goal is to learn your goal is to get case studies and get testimonials and use that to start charging more for your main product more for your lead products so that you can make money on that setup fee right so don't worry about it too early on it's too complicated there's too many variables it is something that you should really really avoid early on secondly you need to be cautious about the timing and the terms of your retainers as I said if you're getting with a client that you don't necessarily want to work with for a long time or you're not charging enough as I say there's a lot of variables in there be very very cautious at least when you're doing your first ones before you have any kind of data points to base your numbers off so you could get locked into something you really don't want to be in for way too long you could lose money every single month if you do the math wrong so be very cautious about it but uh there's always plenty of help in my community if you want to have a chat to our guys in there and finally a full retainer or retainer only model does exist and we're running it at warning site automation but it is not for beginners now if you guys want me to do more of a deep dive in what we're doing on the automation side

other creators who were also talking on the topic now and it seems that many of you are being led down the wrong path so as the creator of the model effort I would come on here and set the record straight and give you a complete beginner's blueprint on exactly how I would start an AI automation agency and take it from zero to sixty thousand dollars per month where my business is currently so if you've heard all about how the AI automation agency model is the next big thing in online business and you want to get off on the absolute best foot possible then this is a video for you this video has taken weeks to prepare and the information that you're about to get is the result of three plus months of trial and error within my own AI automation agency so if you are serious about becoming a triple A owner and taking advantage of the enormous opportunity that is in front of us right now then what I need you to do right now is to pause this video close all the other tabs go and get a notebook and then come back and prepare to sit here for an hour and hour and a half however long this video ends up being and you're going to want to add this video to your watch later because there is no way that you can just watch this once and get all the information you're going to need to come back and likely watch this multiple times and go over certain sections again and again and again and don't worry when you get to the end of the video I'm not going to be sending you just some more free training where I've actually put up the real information I'm giving you everything you need in this video I'm not leaving anything out and you're going to be getting some information that I probably shouldn't be giving away on YouTube but I wanted to give you the exact blueprint that I would use if I was starting from xero and it's the exact same blueprint that I teach to thousands of students within my community now as you can already probably tell by the length of this video we do have a lot to get through today so we're going to be starting off with whether entrepreneurship is right for you which is an important question to ask before you even start this video then I'm going to be breaking down what the AI automation agency actually is and explaining why the opportunity for us right now is so large next we'll go through a quick explanation of the things you need to start and more importantly the things you don't need to start which often hold up a lot of beginners when starting a new online business and then we're going to be getting into the juicy stuff of this video which is going to be your Niche selection offer creation how to find and close your first clients how to service those clients and then giving away a few of my secrets to scaling to ten thousand dollars per month and Beyond any tips and tricks that I'm giving away in that last section are going to be immensely valuable for anyone who is serious about this business model because it's all of the learnings that I've had from running and building my company you're going to get to understand all of those things that I did wrong and apply them to your business and get it right the first time now if you're new to the channel you probably want a little bit of information about who I am and why you should bother listening to a big long video by me in the first place my name is Liam otley I'm 23 years old and originally from New Zealand but I'm now based in Dubai and currently I'm in Europe for the summer and I'm here in Dusseldorf in Germany I'm the creator of the AI automation agency model and I actually run the largest community of AI automation agency owners in the world I've got over 11 000 members in the Discord and we're growing quickly I've been doing online business since I left High School coming up for five years ago now I'm the founder and CEO of my own AI automation agency and AI development company called Morningside AI I'm currently doing around 100 000 per month in Revenue by growing very quickly so a little bit more information about my company we have Morningside AI Morningside Automation and Morningside Studio as I mentioned we're doing around a hundred thousand dollars per month in Revenue warning site AI is strictly a development company where we build custom coded applications for clients Morningside automation is of course the automation wing of our business where we do full business automations with AI and finally Morningside studio is where we build full SAS applications and SAS platforms typically partnering with a co-founder or a startup as development partners and we take equity in those businesses we've actually just launched a beta test for our new productized automation service so if you're interested in that and want to join the waitlist we do have a link in the description and in the pin comment now before we get stuck into the good stuff of this video I just want to draw a bit of attention to a giveaway that I'm running at the end of this video that I know many of you are going to be very very interested in if you've been watching my videos recently you'll know that I have a free incubator program that's just starting this week and that's called the original eight it is a 100 free and application only incubator and we have chosen all of the members of the eight but what we're giving away at the end of this this video is going to be what we're calling spectator spots so if you're interested in learning more about how you can win one of these spectator spots I'll give you more information on that at the end of the video so before you waste even another second watching this video we need to address the question of is entrepreneurship right for you is starting your own business right for you and do you have what it takes and have the commitment required to make this successful in the long run entrepreneurship and particularly online entrepreneurship has become very romanticized and hip these days but there's actually a significant Dark Side to it that you don't really see a lot of the time on Instagram and you don't see all of the failures really so I thought I'd take you through a little bit right now on my experience of becoming an entrepreneur and how I've gone from basically having no skills and no money to where I am now and comfortably traveling the world and living my the life that I've always dreamed of with my friends as I've said in my other videos building an online business takes time effort and sacrifice and there's no way around it I'm not going to sit here and tell you this is going to be easy it's going to be a walk in the park because it's not and it's going to probably take you a lot longer than you think right now to find My Success the life of an entrepreneur is dotted with brutal ups and downs the highest of highs and lowest of lows the most difficult thing for a lot of people to adapt to about entrepreneurship is that at the end of the day you are entirely responsible for your successes and for your failures so there's total accountability on both sides and because of this not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship and not everyone has what it takes everything I'm telling you is from my own experience of being an online entrepreneur for coming up five years now since I graduated high school over my years as an online entrepreneur I've had my fair share of ups and downs I started my entrepreneurial Journey on my Gap year while I was living in Edinburgh I have a crusty flat and I was working for hours before I went to work I'll go to work I would come back I would go to the gym and then I'd work all the time before I went to bed so the the life of an entrepreneur starting out can be very tough and a lot of the time the success that you envision happening takes a lot longer than you thought initially but success is possible and it is rewarded to the people who are willing to do the work on a long enough time scale so as someone who used to sell fake Rolex and protein powder at school to someone who now owns one just believe me and that it is worthwhile if you're willing to do the work and when you do get there I promise you it is the best job in the world I get to work on projects that I'm excited to work on every day I get to work wherever in the world that I want to I get to make money with people I really enjoy being around and with my best friends and at a certain stage you're able to set your sites on building something that you're truly proud of like I am right now with Morningside AI what I'm trying to say is that you need to be self-aware enough to be able to ask yourself the question of do I have what it takes am I ready to commit myself to this journey that is going to take probably a lot longer than I think but is the reward at the end of it worth my time and commitment now now if for you the answer to that question is yes and you are ready to commit to this journey just know that getting started is the hardest part and in this video I've created it around helping you guys get that first step done as easily as possible and with the absolute best information that's going to lead you down the right path now if you haven't already go and get your notebook and go and get a pin and save this video to your watch later because you're going to need to sit here for at least an hour an hour and a half just this first time and then come back to it and really study each part of this video so that you can get your start on the right foot now the first thing we need to cover in this video of course is what is an AI automation agency I'm going to be giving you my exact definition of what the model is before going into what kind of services you can sell and more importantly giving you real world examples of what they would look like in action so there's a lot of information in here and some of it might seem a little over your head but I promise you at the end of it it's going to all make sense so please just stick with me and don't get overwhelmed so my official definition for what an AI automation agency or AAA is this the AI automation agency model is an online business model focused on helping small to medium-sized businesses to automate their systems and processes with AI technology first we can take a high level look at what the business model is and first and foremost it is a beginner friendly model for a number of reasons that we'll be going into later it is a excellent business model to start as a beginner as long as you have the drive to succeed secondly I'm why this business model is getting so much attention lately is because it is the perfect on-ramp for entrepreneurs who are aspiring and experienced to get into Ai and start building businesses it's Auto suitable for people with a nine-to-five job who are looking to pick up a side hustle and spend maybe five to ten hours a week trying to sell a couple of these on the side at the end of the day for most people all it takes is one to two clients per month in order to replace your your regular income so it is totally doable and it's very beginner friendly in that aspect and finally one point that I want to address now before we get any deeper is that you do not need a development background the way I've created the instruction this model is that you will not need to know how to code in order to get your first foot in the door essentially so I'll be explaining that later but right now you're able to start as a complete beginner with basically no skills in any area as long as you're willing to do the work and follow the information in this video so what there's an AI automation agency actually sell what are the core Services of the business on screen we have the three main services that you sell as an AI automation agency firstly starting off with AI chat Bots secondly content generation systems and thirdly AI enhanced automations the most important thing that you need to understand right now is that these Services can actually be delivered on no code platforms initially this bit specifically is really the key to the entire model and when I discovered that you could create these services and sell these services using these low code platforms that was really the start of the whole model and that was the key thing that set this off because without it it's not very beginner friendly and you need to have a development background we need to have developers of your own within your team so this is the the most important thing that you need to understand right now and we're going to be going into more detail on this later now the first core service of course is AI chat Bots and the no code platform of choice for building these chatbots is typically bot press That's great because there's no coding skills needed there's a nice visual editor and visual bot creation platform so highly recommend that you don't need any coding skills there's a very easy learning curve it's not too difficult to get started and in my experience the most important and valuable thing about bot press is a platform for are delivering these Services as a beginner is that the deployment options are really really great this web chat you can easily provide to a client can put a chatbot on their website super easily you can deploy it to a WhatsApp chat bot a telegram chatbot all within a couple of clicks and this is typically the the most difficult part if you're trying to do this yourself is how can I actually take a Chapter that I've created and deploy it to a certain place for the client can use it so Bob press is an excellent chatbot platform it's my personal favorite and we use it within my own company and I'm actually working closely with the team to push new features that help AAA owners like us and one more thing I wanted to add here is that because of the fee structure being based on usage when you create your own chatbots for clients and you pass them over to their account you essentially aren't getting billed for any of that so it's basically free as a triple A owner and very beginner friendly in that regard as well the second core service of an AI automation agency is content generation systems now what content generation systems are is taking a bunch of old or prior content from a client and using that as a knowledge base it sends you to create new ones so say you had a ton of meal plans by a my personal trainer know a fitness expert that you're working with you can take all of their prior meal plans and use those as examples to create new ones so you're using uh prior content to generate new content now my no code platform of choice for building content generation systems and really any llm based applications is called stack AI stack AI is really our go-to platform for building any kind of llm or AI applications using a visual editor rather than having to custom code the whole thing for someone who doesn't have a technical background and you're looking to get into this learning something like bot press to build the chat Bots and learning how to use stack AI it makes you an extremely powerful developer in just a few days or weeks of practice you can get really good at building all sorts of AI applications within stack which is a excellent skill to have not only as AAA owner but in general in this current world we live in and finally we have ai enhanced automations using zapier now of course the API automations are nothing new it's been a very valuable thing for most businesses for a long time but the key here is is that there's a massive increase in value with the AI features that are now available you can see on screen here you can have a chat GPT action and essentially include AI features within your zaps now so it makes it a ton more valuable and opens up a whole world of new possibilities so this connective tissue between different parts of businesses is really really valuable in a lot of cases especially now that there are AI features within zapier so this is the final one and this is the sort of last thing you'll typically do for a client because it's quite complex you need to really be in inside their business and know how everything is working so to give you an idea of the kind of chat Bots you can sell I've gone and put together a big list here and we're going to be giving real life examples of each of them so we have prospecting chat Bots onboarding chat Bots customer service chat bot staff training chatbots and data analysis slash Insight chat bots so what even is a prospecting chat bot and what value does it provide to a business I've actually covered an example of a prospecting chatbot on my channel a few times basically when visitors arrive on the site they can click on the chat bot and they can ask a couple of questions and it's going to capture some information on their visitor and then typically you're going to push to a booking event or some kind of conversion event or capture their information and capture it as a lead so on screen you can see we have objectives and implementation so with any kind of deliverable like a prospecting chatbot or onboarding chatbot it helps to know exactly what the objective is what are you actually trying to do with this and this is something that a lot of people tend to ask questions about in the comments and in my Discord is like what are they actually doing for business where is the value and by creating this objectives and implementation layout every time that you have a specific deliverable or service you can provide you can give the clear objective of it so in this case for a prospecting chat bot the objective is to increase the conversion rate from website visitor to lead and also to capture the user intent for a tailored follow-up so by offering a chat bot on the home page visitors are able to come ask a bunch of questions be directed to relevant products provide a bit of information about themselves and what they're looking for and then you can capture that information as a lead or you can push them to a conversion event as you can see on screen here we have an example of a little demo bot that I created which was capturing the email info here and and creating a lead for the business and so the implementation of this is to get the chat bot added to the home page it's going to ask questions capture the info then it's going to push into a conversion rate or capture the lead now the second example of a chatbot which might be helpful for you guys is an onboarding chat bot so I'm sure you're familiar with onboarding and businesses how you can get clients onboarded into all of these systems and get Contract signs and invoices paid and slack channels set up and all sorts of things about getting a client into their business and starting to to work with them so again we have these objectives and implementation structure of course the primary objective of an onboarding chatbot would be to reduce the number of hours spent by your staff members and onboarding so typically that's going to be the head of operations or the Chief Operating Officer so if we can reduce those hours we're providing real value to the business so by reducing their average onboarding time from say two weeks to three days you're actually increasing the sales velocity now the implementation of this is fairly simple it's just to create the chat bot and deploy it to a web page and it's going to walk the user through the the business's onboarding process and that's going to integrate with DocuSign and stripe and slack and everything like that so they start and by the end of it they're fully onboard into the business and you haven't had to be involved at all now the final example of a chat but I want to share with you guys is a staff training chatbot which is pretty self-explanatory the objective of one of these chatbots is to reduce the number of hours required to onboard new hires so so what the staff training chatbot does is takes all of the training information and documents and frequently asked questions about a business that you typically provide to new hires and you put it into a chat bot with a custom knowledge base your hires can now get 24 7 access to up-to-date information on the business which not only frees up a lot of time on the manager side so they don't have to keep asking questions but also the employee can now get relevant info when they need it potentially leading to higher quality work and and I guess less awkwardness for these new highs and maybe performing the job better so the objective of a staff training chatbot is to reduce the number of hours required to onboard these new hires typically by the managers so if you can save your manager's hours you're saving money and the implementation for this is actually very very simple all you need to do is add the training documents to our custom knowledge base chat bot on something like bot press then you can deploy that chatbot very easily in a couple clicks to Whatsapp or telegram an important note that I wanted to mention now also is that while these chatbots are not always AI focused or strictly an AI chat bot the value of implementing chatbots across businesses is to keep up with the changes in consumer taste and preferences shift that is underway right now which was really triggered by the rise of these large language models and things like chair GPT if they're changing consumer preferences away from point-and-click websites towards natural language input and things like chatting to websites or chatting to services to get their information and do what they need to do so as AAA owners we can help businesses to keep up with these changing preferences by providing them things like chat Bots to do most of the functions of their business this kind of change Echoes the change we went through from desktop websites to mobile now we can get onto content generation systems that will give you a few examples of these we have of course a workout plan generator so we're going to use old workout plans to generate new examples we have things like website copy generators so we take the best performing website copy from a business and use it to generate more then you have things like personalized Outreach message generators which can use information on a person to generate a custom Outreach message to them that's tailored to their sort of background increasing the response rate of course you have blog post generation for SEO as well now an obvious example of a Content generation system that you could create would be a diet plan generator this of course is going to be for fitness trainers and personal trainers Etc and the objective of course is to reduce the time spent by your client uh weekly or monthly and actually writing these personalized plans for people the implementation for something like this is to collect all of the human written Plans by your client and there's typically a little step of actually preparing the data before you ingest it into the knowledge base and once it's in the knowledge base you can start to test and generate outputs and make sure that it's what your client is looking for and finally you can deploy the super easy to a website somewhere or to something like slack and the end result here is that your client can come on and say I need a diet plan for a 40 year old woman who wants to lose weight over nine weeks who's vegan and it can generate a plan based off prior ones that were similar to that now finally our third and final core Services AI enhanced automations there's an unlimited scope on the kind of things you can do here but typically you're going to be using the AI within zapier to handle unstructured data so you've taken a bunch of of text or a bunch of information about a client or a customer and you can take that through a higvd action and get it to Output a certain thing so you want it in this format or I want to extract these bits of information so these new chat GPT actions can really elevate your zpu automations because you can handle new data types now and do new operations really so a few examples of AI enhanced automations that you can create for businesses would be something like an inbound classification system to classify inbound requests also lead vetting to check that it meets a criteria that your business wants to work with and finally something like a personalized Outreach system using AI to generate personalized messages for people so a good example of an AI enhanced APO automation could be a resume assessment system so this is great for businesses that do a lot of hiring and they get a lot of inbound requests and people sending their resumes to apply for different positions for the HR team to look through all of these resumes and determine who is good news not can take up a lot of hours this system will be focused on as you can see here the objective would be to reduce hrl spent on resume so the way this kind of system would work would be with a hiring form where people can go on and see the information in they can upload their own resume and then once that's all sent off it can be pushed over to a Google sheet where all of the information is available there now from there you can get zapier to pull each row each applicant out of that Google sheet and get the information and scrape the data out of the PDF or the resume that they've sent pass that information as context to a prompted chat gbt action within and then in that chat CPT prompt you can give it a instruction saying you are a resume application grader you will be provided with resume information and then you're going to Output a grade from one to ten here is the resume that you're going to receive and then you programmatically enter that end within zapier then all you need to do is say if the output grade from the chat GPD action is above a seven then take that row that you've taken from the sheet and add that to a new sheet of successful applicants so that's taken a ton of time and ton of work off the HR teams hands example number two could be a lead vetting system the objective of course of a lead bidding system will be to reduce the number of hours your team spends vetting leads for the way this could work with an AI enhanced APS setup is to create a lead form on your website collect information on that such as the website and their LinkedIn profile then you need to set up a zap on zapier that's going to scrape the web page and also scrape the LinkedIn profile for the information then you're going to pass the information to it prompt the chat GPT action as we've done in the previous one and prompt it with a certain criteria of say you are a lead vetting bot we only work with clients who meet this this sisters you are going to be provided with information by about a business that's applied to us please output only a grade of XYZ or please output a zero if it's declined or a one if that's accepted then if the output of that chat gbt action is a one or successful then you can send them an email and say hey we'd love to work with you here's how you can book in a call so that's how you can set up a lead vetting system using a chat GPT action within zapier and finally to give you just one more example of these kind of core services that you can provide as an AI automation agency owner is a personalized Outreach system now I've covered this before in videos but it's such a good one that I want to cover it again the point of one of these systems is to create customized messages to reach out to businesses or clients that you want to work with so people get bombarded with all sorts of marketing and requests if you're a big business especially so many requests from people with generic emails the point here is to take information from the LinkedIn profile or any other data source and create a personalized message using your chat GPT action and zapier to increase the response rate so it doesn't sound right you've just been said blanket statement you've just been shot out to a big list of cold emails this feels like someone's taking the time to craft a special message for you and the point of it and the objective here of course is to increase the response rate on cold Outreach the implementation for this is very similar to the other two it actually connects to the lead vetting system if you want it to as soon as the vetted leads arrive on a new sheet you can set up another zap that's going to scrape information from their profile or you could even pass the information across from the previous one actually scrape that information then you're going to pass that to a prompter chat gbt action again and you can pass it some instructions like you are a personalized Outreach message writer here is some information about our business and the products we sell we are trying to reach out for clients for this Services here's the information about the client please write a personalized Outreach method and maybe you can throw in an example of some previous cold Outreach messages that you've used to clients that have worked as an example to increase the quality of the output then once you've got their customized message back from the chat GPT actions API you can use another action within zapier to send an email to the client instantly and start the communications from there okay that's all of the examples I've got for you please please please don't feel overwhelmed if any of that seems to be going over your head I promise you that that doesn't take long at all to come up to speed on that and there's people on my Discord who have been doing it for a couple of days or a couple of weeks and they're experts on it already so don't get overwhelmed all of the automations that I've just mentioned can be done with no code or low code tools and better yet ninety percent of them particularly the chat Bots can actually be copy and pasted using templates so I create templates and share them with my Discord and in my resource Hub and I can basically build something and give it to my community and they can just plug and play it into their own system so don't worry if that seems complex and you think oh no I can't do this there's no way I'd be able to figure out how to build these things a lot of it can be templated and a lot of it you're going to be able to get as resources from my channel and from my community so you can just plug and play it and and jump start your success and get off on the right foot and I guess the most important thing is that the method I actually teach and recommend for beginners and I'm teaching to thousands of people within my community is heavily simplified and I strip it down to the absolute Bare Bones of the only thing you need to focus on as beginner so that you can get your foot in the door because I know it can be difficult when you get overwhelmed and there's so many things you need to do I've simplified this method down and really really boiled it down to the only thing you need to worry about so you're going to learn about that next before we get stuck into things like Niche selection and off creation I'll actually explain my entire system for beginners so that we're all on the same page and you know where we're working towards so I'll be covering that in a few minutes an important question you might be asking now is okay I've learned all this stuff I know how to build this but how am I actually getting paid what's the pricing structure the fee structure the revenue model for this model well there's a couple of options firstly just fixed contracts say 2 500 in Syria or Contracting retainer where I say I build you something for a thousand and then you pay me 500 a month or you can do a strictly retainer model which is quite an advanced model and that's something that we've been doing at Morningside and we're actually launching that at the moment all of this and how you get paid is going to be covered in the offer creation section in a few minutes now I thought I'd add in this final slide in this what is an AI automation agency section of how AI automation agencies stack up against other online business models right now so here on screen you can see we have business model the saturation level the startup costs the learning curve and the scalability now these are important categories that I think go into making a business model good or bad for beginners especially and I've included some of the most common business models that we see in the online space today including social media marketing agencies Drop Shipping Amazon FBA trading and of course the new kid on the Block the AI automation agency or AAA of course smma and 2023 is a highly saturated and competitive industry I've got low startup costs because it's the agency model you don't have to pay anything out of your pocket until you get paid the learning curve for actually learning how to run a social media marketing agency is very very steep not only do you have to learn how to run a business aspect but you also need to learn how to sell products online and sell services online so there's two major things you need to learn and the online marketing as it's become more and more competitive has gotten even harder so it is quite a steep learning curve if you're starting smma in terms of scalability and smma is medium you know like you can get some good clients on there you can start stacking a bunch of retainers be making 50 to 100 000 a month but you're not going to be making millions and millions of dollars a month unless you're some of the top guys in the space secondly we have Drop Shipping which of course is extremely saturated the startup costs are obviously higher than smma because you're going to need to be using your your credit card or your debit card to pay for ads the learning curve is medium because you still have to learn how to use Shopify manage a Shopify store but more importantly you have to learn how to run traffic and run Facebook ads and Instagram ads things like that well Tech talk ads more recently but a good thing about a Drop Shipping Store is that the scalability is very high because if you do it right you can start making a ton of money as a drop shipper convert it over into a brand and do things correctly and then eventually exit on that so there is quite a lot of potential upside if you do a Drop Shipping Store correctly with the right product thirdly we have Amazon FBA which just like the other two I've just mentioned because they've been around for a long enough time it's also saturated the startup cost for FBA can be a lot of money because you're having to buy a ton of stock in order to get started and I've put their learning curve down as high because I think for anything where you're dealing with tons of stock and you're putting a lot of money up front you don't have that low risk environment to experiment with so you need to be a lot more calculated in every step you make your margin for error and being able to learn by failing is a lot lower it's harder to get good at it and they're learning curve is steep but once you have an FBA business up and running and you're ranking well and in keywords and you're getting a lot of sales coming in consistently it is fairly scalable up to a point where you're limited by the actual search volume so not much you can do after you get to that sort of cap on the search volume for your particular products now the fourth one here is trading which I guess is more of a job or profession rather than a business trading is probably one of the most saturated things on the planet you have not only regular people like you and I doing it but you have huge businesses and institutions who are trading as well now because trading has been around for hundreds of years it is probably the most saturated thing you could buy possibly get into at this point startup costs are medium because you need a little bit of capital to actually get started and start trading it you could start with 100 but that's really going to put a cap on how quickly you can grow and the learning curve for trading are put down as extreme because as I said there's so many other competitors in the market as the most saturated thing you could probably get into you are going up against hedge funds and institutions so you're trying to trade is basically going up against the big guys so to be able to consistently make money as a Trader is one of the the hardest things you could do an online business at the moment and of course trading has a bit of a scalability issue where it's you always doing the trades unless you're teaching other people and getting them to do it for you but really the only thing ever you can play with to increase your scale is to throw big amounts of money at your trades so how does this new AI automation agency model stack up against these other tried and tested business models well first of all the saturation of the AI automation agency space and of offering AI automation agency Services is is low I'd almost even say zero at this point because there's basically no one really offering these services and businesses have never been offered Arman Mission Services before because AI has only really been popularized in the last six to eight months and come to the front of the public Consciousness business owners across the world have not yet been offered AI automation agency Services they haven't had someone come to them and say hey I can integrate AI into your business and it's going to do this this and this they haven't heard about it and it's a new offer so the saturation is low and secondly of course the startup costs are low it's the same agency model as smma where you're only going to have to put up money when you've been paid money so you collect money from the client say a thousand dollars then you pay 300 to a contractor to deliver it or something like that now if you're listening earlier in the video you'll know that the learning curve for it is actually low because you're going to start off using no code tools so all you need to do is a new AAA owner is to be familiar with these no code tools to create AI chat Bots content generation systems and AI enhance automations and better yet you can get your start with your own AO automation agency using templates from other people so this is such a key part because it makes your learning curve so accessible to people looking to get into it and the last Point here of scalability is really still an open-ended question I'm scaling mine as fast as possible and trying out new services and offerings but we haven't really seen how far this thing can go and I'm really really excited to see not only where Morningside and our automation when goes but people within my community who are focused on different niches and doing different things with their agencies now that you are up to speed on what the AI automation agency model is and the exact kinds of services that you can provide and the benefits they provide to your clients we can get stuck into what your starting requirements are what you need and more importantly what you don't need many of you will be happy to know that all you need to start an AI automation agency is a computer or laptop with an internet connection and an email more importantly the things that you don't need to start include coding skills or a development background any form of startup capital or money to get started you don't need any prior business experience either while it is great and it will help you in a number of ways this business model is intended to be a great on-ramp for people who are starting as an AI entrepreneur because it's an agency model and you learn basically the full ropes of how to start a business now to manage clients and things like that you do not need a registered business you don't need to file for an LLC you can run this entirely under your personal at the start to get started and then further down the line you can get your company structure set up and things like that so at the start you don't need a registered company to begin you just need to register as a sole proprietor and despite what many of you may think you do not need a website to start an AI automation agency this is an issue I see all the time with people spending way too much time starting a website when you can actually get started with that one and finally you don't need any employees to start you can start with just yourself learn the ropes and then start to Outsource that to other people whenever you're ready now on the topic of employees there are two ways you can go about starting this firstly is the freelancer model where you yourself are the service provider and you are going to learn enough about bot press and stack Ai and things like that to be able to take templates from other people play around with them a little bit and hand them over to your client or you can use the agency model where you yourself are not actually delivering the services rather you have people underneath you who are servicing that for you so these are outsourced to contractors or Freelancers and things like that for many of you starting out I would recommend taking the freelancer route initially just so you can get familiar with these tools and then you're able to effectively hand it off to other people and Outsource that once you need to focus more time on the the business side of things of scaling up and getting more clients and how you can continually build these systems and be bigger and better and more efficient for those of you who are looking to jump straight into the agency model and not touch any service delivery yourself is a little incubator hack of mine for my community which is to find business partners inside my community we have literally thousands of developers who are hungry for work and some of them who are also Keen to partner with you on the business so if you were a a entrepreneur who wants to focus on the sales side on the marketing side on on the generating clients and generating leads you can focus on that side you can make a post on our very active startup board where you can say hey I'm looking to handle this side of the business who wants to partner with me on it and we go on together and in that way you won't have to pay them hourly but if you are looking to retain all of the ownership of the business yourself we also have a jobs board where you can say I'm looking to hire a chatbot developer hey is anyone interested in this role I'd like to pay you this this and this and then all of the developers in there will be able see that and they can reply to it and DM you and sort out a contract like that as I said we are the number one Community for AAA owners in the world right now with over 11 000 members and growing very quickly so if you want any kind of hiring be it a co-founder or hiring a developer or a salesperson even you can come in there make a post and get sorted out very very quickly if you're looking to join the community and haven't already the link to join will be in the description and the pin comment another key part of being successful as an entrepreneur and as an AI automation agency owner is of course your mindset so I just wanted to briefly touch here in this module to cover a bunch of things that I've learned and experienced in my journey as an entrepreneur and pass them on to you guys who was just starting this journey and things that I wish I knew sooner that's going to really really help you to become the best entrepreneur possible and find success as quickly as possible I'm going to be giving you a few points which will be hugely valuable on your entrepreneurial Journey so I want you to get that notebook and get that pin and start jotting these down because you're going to need to stick them up above your face on your wall every day you're working because some of these things you need to be reminded of daily to not forget them meant to continue to put them into practice every day firstly entrepreneurship is a marathon not a Sprint if you're watching this video right now you are obviously interested in pursuing this as a career but what you need to do is zoom out a little bit and understand that this is a long-term process and essentially you should be looking to do this for the rest of your life if you're really serious about it let me tell you right now that this is not going to make you rich overnight and if you are a complete beginner entrepreneur and you've never even run a business before what you need to be trying to do with this is to learn how to become an entrepreneur learn the skills of an entrepreneur not focus on the money necessarily initially you are trying to do this business model and running it so that you can learn the skills that entrepreneurs have and those are the skills that allow you to generate money consistently there are so many cases of people who make a ton of money then just completely fall back the Baseline because they didn't actually have the skills under them to make them someone who's able to generate money consistently so please approach this business model as something that is going to most importantly teach you the valuable and Timeless skills of the entrepreneur of how to get clients how to manage clients how to deliver Services how to run a business because these are the things that you are never going to be able to be taught in a degree or buy a course or something so it's the actual running of the business that's going to teach you more things than any of those degrees could if you value the freedom to be able to travel anywhere to make money with people you love to do things that excite you every day then you need to be clear that this is a marathon and not a Sprint but if you put in the work it will all be worth it secondly you need to avoid assumptions at all cost by assumptions I mean when you think to yourself oh I don't think the customer would like this or I think that this would sell or I think that this it does not matter what you think you are assuming things about the market the market will tell you what's true the market will give you feedback on what is actually the truth in the situation therefore it is your job as the entrepreneur to ensure that all of your assumptions are tested in the market you get data back and you use that to make decisions spending an entire month on making a website because you think this is what they're going to like this is not the way to go you need to directly test something as quickly as possible in the market get data back and make your decisions off of that so right that down because you're going to need to remember that every day am I assuming things about the market am I assuming things about what my customers wants which is an absolute death sentence for an entrepreneur thirdly perfect is the enemy of good this is an old saying which means that the insistence on Perfection often gets in the way of the implementation of good outcomes this is often combined with the Pareto Principle which is the 80 20 rule if you're familiar with it in this instance it means that 20 of the time spent on a task can deliver 80 of the Perfection so as soon as you start going past the good and trying to get to perfect you end up spending far more time than necessarily when you've really done that 20 already and you should just push that 80 out now sounds a bit numerical but essentially you need to avoid being perfectionist in the early stages of your business because this is often the number one killer of would-be entrepreneurs so all of that simplified down basically what I'm trying to say is that it's better to get something out that is of good quality than get nothing out at all that is of perfect quality or take five times as long so speed is your friend here and getting things out will always Trump waiting and waiting and waiting to push out a perfect instance of it now this ties back to my earlier point of avoiding assumptions it's so important to do the good work and get it out quickly and test the market get a response back and then you can go okay I'm on the right track if you spin five times as long trying to get a perfect outcome and then you test it on the market and it completely flops you've just wasted so much time when you could have put out a good example gotten feedback and then gone back to the drawing board and you could be multiple steps ahead of where your perfect self would be my fourth piece of advice would be to accept chaos and accept that it is a natural state for any small business you are going to be constantly putting out fires and when you put them out they're going to keep popping back up so just get used to it and don't get mad at it don't be like man I suck at this why is this happening this is just what a startup feels like this is what starting a business is like at the early stages don't get mad and frustrated that problems keep popping up with your business this is just the nature of early stage businesses and to get mad at that and feel down about it would be like being mad at the Sun for being hot you know it's just baked into it you're going to have chaos you're going to have issues all the time so get used to it and finally my personal favorite and something that I've used over and over again in my career is that you need to go through hard to get to easy learning new stuff and throwing yourself in the deep end is going to feel hard it's going to feel impossible and uncomfortable and just horrible to go through at times but that is just the nature of learning new things say for example after this video you go and try to learn how to use bot press you're going to get in there and you're going to feel stupid you're going to feel completely incapable and out of your dip but that is just part of it you have to go through hard to get to easy if you do the work for a week or two and you roll around in that uncomfortable feeling but you push through eventually and before you know it really it's going to feel easy you have to go through hard to get to easy I've experienced this multiple times in my career when I first started learning Facebook ads I remember going into the business manager and feeling completely stupid and looking around like how am I ever going to get my head around this but if you just keep pushing through eventually it's like breathing it's like riding a bike you know exactly how to do it remember that this is one of the most important traits of an entrepreneur and it's what separates us as entrepreneurs from Regular People and that's to be able to be comfortable in uncomfortable environments and literally sit there for years and years at a time feeling uncomfortable but still go through and still continuing to improve and of course the growth as a person and as an entrepreneur is always going to be where you're uncomfortable so get used to it with the mindset stuff out of the way and hopefully you've taken all those notes down and you're going to stick it up in front of your face now I can get stuck into explaining my exact system for beginners Who start an AI automation agency in 2023 and Beyond and this is the exact methods that I teach you not only all of my community members the 11 000 or more people in there right now but also to my free incubator program which is the original eight that I'm writing right now as well I've put this thing together piece by piece to make it as beginner friendly as possible and there's nothing else like this on the instair right now so we can jump straight into explaining my system the four key steps of my system are firstly to pick a niche secondly to pick a specific deliverable thirdly to learn by doing and then fourth you can increase prices and scale the first step in my system is to pick a niche now before we even pick a niche you need to know why you're niching down because this is a mistake that I see so many beginners make it's going too broad and thinking that they're smart enough or capable enough to take on an entire industry or even the entire scope of automation on their own as their first business I have covered this in depth and my best niches for AI automation video which will be available up here but for the sake of this video I'm also going to go through it again and give you a quick overview of why you need to Niche down and why it is so important by narrowing down to a specific industry or Niche or business type you have the potential to sell the exact same product for a hundred times the value or even more the example I used in my previous video is actually from Alex from Ozzie and his book 100 million offers where he uses the example of a time management course so say a time management course that's for everyone might be what 19 but what if we Niche it down to say time management for sales reps okay maybe we could sell it for 200 what if we go a step further and say that this time management course is for gardening and power tools sales reps maybe we could sell it for 997 dollars and if we Niche it down one more time and speak directly to a specific and small group of people we could say this is a time management course for outbound Power Tools and Gardening sales reps and the in the Texas area or something like that where it's so Niche we could charge maybe two thousand dollars for it and the key Point here is that you could be selling essentially the same product as the time management course at twenty dollars but for two thousand dollars it's the same product maybe with a few tweaks but it's at the end of the day it's a same product you're just selling it to a very specific Niche and the person who hears that this is an offer for them they're like wow this is exactly what I need and that's an example of how you can sell the exact same product for up to a hundred times more another factor that compounds this benefit of you niching down is not only can you sell your product for up to 100 times more you can streamline all of your messaging towards that specific Avatar so imagine I'm selling a time management course and I'm trying to run social media ads for it that's very very broad I'm not able to Target down and when people see it it's like it's just another time management course but if I narrow it down to that tiny little power tools outbound reps Avatar mentioned before and then the ad copy or the we website copy on your landing page is all tailored towards wow we do it for this this person or the specific thing they're going to be much more responsive it's going to shoot your click-through rate your response rate up through the roof and your conversion rate at the end of the day so not only are you going to be able to sell the same product for up to 100 times more you are going to be able to get far better results by narrowing down your your messaging and all of your websites and your ad copy so that you are getting a high response rate and better performance from your ads as well the final nail in the coffin if you're still not convinced that you need to Niche down and you think you can do it without it is that the systems efficiency gains of actually niching down to a specific Niche and deliverable are enormous what I mean by this is that if you are generalized and you try to attack all niches at once when you get a client come in you can build all the work for them you can service them all you want you can make with these automations and then when they're gone someone else comes in from a different Niche you have to provide completely new services for them you need to figure out how to piece together some kind of service offering for them by doing this over and over and over again your team is going to always be doing new stuff and the team's doing you stuff is not efficient you're going to be having to come up with new Solutions all the time and that takes much longer than taking an existing solution copying it over and changing a few things about it so by narrowing down to a specific Niche and a specific deliverable as I'm going to show you next you are able to build up a portfolio of different services and and products that you can sell to people so when you service a client within a particular Niche and you get a new one coming you can take all of the stuff you've done before copy and paste it over get your developer or your team member to make the tweaks necessary to make it work for that client and you've just saved so much time and your profit margins are going to be immeasurably higher and one final thing I wanted to add in here is that because this is such a new space and there's no industry leaders yet you have a chance if you Niche down and say I'm a legal automations expert or something you can become the the go-to guy because there's no one there yet if you start now and Niche down and start getting a a portfolio of companies and clients that are really happy with your services you can establish yourself as a leader and be in a great position to get unlimited business from here on Now The Next Step Beyond niching down is to pick a specific deliverable within that Niche so here on screen you can see it that AI automation as a whole is a very broad field as we've gone through in this video there's chat boxes content generation system there's AI enhanced AP flows and things like this there's so much if you're trying to take it all at once as a beginner your head's going to be spinning by narrowing down to one Niche and one deliverable say I make onboarding chatbots for tax law firms or something like this so I make staff training chat Bots for construction companies you Niche down to the industry and then also to the specific deliverable this makes it far easier to communicate the benefits to the client because you can say instead of I'll automate your business which is like what does that even mean you go to them and you say I will give you this specific AI deliverable which is going to do this to your bottom line or reduce these hours here and increase this here you can communicate the benefits much easier to clients in this way because the offers so new and people aren't used to this sort of stuff yet furthermore when you narrowed down to just one deliverable you can afford to invest in new features to add to that deliverable so say you have a a onboarding chatbot for smma clients you can now get a developer to come in and build some custom features into that chatbot because you're going to be copy and pasting that over to other clients you can invest in improving it and adding new features and really separating yourself from the competition so this is how you get ahead this is how you create at the front of the screen here in the house Source or proprietary technology that really sets you apart from the competitors and allows you to provide extreme amounts of values to the client and as I kind of touched on there the major benefit of narrowing down to a specific deliverable as well is again this messaging and systems efficiency your messaging can be more direct and you can say we do this for this to this this kind of business with these results we built onboarding chat Bots for tax law firms it's very narrow the messaging on your ads and on your website copy can be so specific and more so you can just copy and paste these over but when you're only dealing with one specific Niche and then one specific deliverable within that Niche you just go from one tax firm and make an onboarding chat bot copy it over adjust it to the systems and then you're done like it's copy and paste at that point when you're doing only one deliverable this is of course has huge benefits to your bottom line but I will say as a business owner to your peace of mind because when you have team members running around and solving custom issues every single time trust me I've dealt with it in my own company it can be a absolute Nightmare and knowing that these guys only have to copy and paste over make a tweak is the peace of mind that you're really looking for when you're running a business basically what I'm trying to say is do not make it hard on yourself by trying to attack the whole automation space or the entire niche of the whole world at once Niche down to a specific industry each down to a specific deliverable and that will just take all of the other factors away and as a beginner you need to simplify it as much as possible for yourself in the beginning The Next Step once you have your niche in your deliverable is to get out there and start learning by doing whether you are freelancing initially and delivering the services yourself or you're going straight to the agency model and Outsourcing to a developer or to another team member to deliver these Services the process here is going to be the same you need to get some experience of doing this for real clients the goal here is to get Hands-On inside a business and start to really understand who your Niche is who your avatar is and how you can deliver these Services easily and and get a real feel for what this business model is and how it operates and and how you can handle your team members and how you can deliver it's just so important to keep your foot in the door and start learning by doing rather than sitting around and trying to land this massive whale of a client that's going to bring you three thousand dollars you are in the phase of learning rather than earning and Alex mozzie talks about this all the time this is the phase of your business that is the learning phase not the earning phase as you can see on screen it is great if you can get paid to learn if you can go into a business and get paid 500 or 600 to go in and deliver your first services or your first couple of them that is great but you should really be willing to go in for free and offer these services to businesses that you can get in touch with for free and and really get an idea of how this thing fits together and most importantly collecting the testimonials and case studies that you're going to use for your sixth client your seventh client and then you can start charging some real money so you're learning you're collecting some testimonials and case studies that you can show to Future clients that is the goal here over deliver and give them the best treatment possible the last step might be beginner system is to increase your prices and start to scale the business from there here is where all of the hard work that you've put in in the learning by doing phase comes into play and you start to be able to actually generate money and profit with your business when you're pitching to new clients you'll be able to point to your previous ones and say these are the results for businesses that I've got who are exactly the same as you here's another tax law firm who I did this for and they got these results here's what I can do for you and this is how much it costs once you have the ball rolling and those testimonials coming in you can start to test higher and higher prices and you can start to Outsource the server delivery if you're still doing it as a freelancer so you can make your first hire and say okay I'm going to train him up on how to deliver these and how to copy and paste them over between and make the changes required at this stage you can begin to expand your offering Beyond just one deliverable so you're no longer going to just be the onboarding chatbot for legal tax law firms you can say I'm going to do this this and this and then once I'm in there and I have the onboarding chapel built out I can say hey I also do this or I can also add this feature to the bot or I can connect it to your I can connect it to your lead system and do this so you can start to blow more options and increase the aov of each of the clients by offering more services once you've actually got them in the door and it's at this stage that you as the business owner once you have it outsourced to someone else to deliver the services you can really focus on bringing more sales and building your funnel out so that you can start to build a consistent stream of clients if you're still here I want you to give yourself a pat on the back you've made it to the important part of Niche selection everything I've just taught you is absolutely crucial to know before you get started and this has prepped you to be able to make the right decisions within this particular module and thus we start the process of selecting your Niche now the first step in picking your Niche is of course coming up with a bunch of potential niches that you can choose now for this I have a little hack that we use in our AAA incubator Community which is to use a chat GPT prompt to get a bunch of different Niche ideas coming back at you so that you can start to analyze them with the Frameworks that I'm about to show you as you can see on screen here you're probably only aware of a fraction of the potential niches possible and I find when you're trying to think of new Niche ideas you tend to get stuck in this thought Loop of the same five or ten niches over and over and my reasons those Hub in the description you're going to be able to get access to the exact chat GPT prompt that myself and my community use to consistently generate high quality and ideal Niche ideas for your AI automation agency now I've carefully structured this prompt to ensure that it's only putting out the specific kinds of niches that are really good for AI automation agencies now when I was playing around with this it can sometimes throw some really complex ones and ones that are not suitable but the prompt that's available on my resource Hub will give you really really good ideas that will give you a perfect set of starting niches that you can take into the next steps of this video so if you want to get instant access to that and all of my workshop recordings and all of the resources for this video you can sign up to my members area in the description below the next question is what makes a niche good or bad for an AI automation Agency on screen here you have my Niche selection criteria and we have five key points here that I like to check each news against before moving forward with it firstly the niche needs to have a high purchasing power secondly it needs to be easy to Target thirdly it needs to have a large Market size fourth it needs to have a high automation potential and finally if you're familiar with the niche that's also a bonus we can break down those points a little bit more just to help you guys understand what each of them means so firstly we have purchasing power now a good purchasing power is typically decided by other clients or customers that they work with are they selling High ticket products or services or do they have extremely high margins on the products that they do sell so this will typically mean that they have a lot of money to spend on services like you're trying to sell them for easy to Target this can be determined by how easily can you find and contact business owners within the space a quick Google Facebook and Linkedin search can be very helpful here so you can Facebook search a a particular Niche name you might show something like SEO agency owners or something like that on Facebook or the same on LinkedIn if you're able to find communities of these people floating around online and that's a great sign that these people are easy to Target or for some Industries you can just Google Search and say find me a coach or a tutor if you search that up you're going to find a ton of marketplaces for coaches and tutors where you can get in touch with them directly and offer them your services thirdly we have Market size which is pretty straightforward how many business businesses are there in an XYZ area so how many taxable firms are there in the United States you can search this just trade on Google and it's going to give you pretty quick answers back on the total Market size now if you go too Niche with it you go down to a boutique arts and crafts stores for elderly people in Virginia or something like that's there's not enough in that market size for you to bother making a automation offer around and finally we have the automation potential criteria which I will go into more detail later it's a bit of a different story on screen we have an example Niche analysis table now all of the tables that you're going to see over this next course of the video is going to be available on my resource Hub in the description so when you're watching all of this you're going to be able to go and get a version of this for you to use on your own and start to put in the niches that you get from your chat gbt prompt and you can put them in here and start to do your own analysis of the niches that you have a quick glance of the niches we have here I've chosen Airbnb management smmas e-commerce restaurants dental and legal pretty straightforward niches Airbnb management companies typically have money to spend they're leasing out different apartments and stuff for above market rate smmas yes they have clients that are coming in quite a lot of cash flow lots of money to spend e-commerce stores a lot of money to spend if they're running profitably restaurants not so much dentists typically have high ticket clients so that's yes they do have enough money to spend and legal also the clients are typically High ticket as well so that's a breakdown of the money to spend side of things now are they easy to Target Airbnb management companies can be reached out to directly on Airbnb so they're easy to Target enough social media marketing agencies very easy to to get in touch with or find communities for online they they hang out in all sorts of places on Facebook and Linkedin and things like that e-commerce stores you can find on the Facebook ads library and get in touch with them via their email their support email for restaurants Dental legal all going to have their contact information available online somewhere where the Google Maps are on their website then we have Market size which for Airbnb managements might not be as large as these other ones but the rest of them are all fairly large niches and we haven't gone too Niche so we haven't gone say Italian restaurants which would maybe be a bit of a smaller Market size or tax law firms are trying bit of a smaller one I've kept them all pretty broad so the market sizes are all pretty large in the familiar tab I'm familiar with the top three but not with the bottom three you would do the same for you if you were familiar with restaurants you would say yes there as well as I said all of these tables are going to be available on my resource Hub so you can get them all there after this video the final piece of the puzzle for choosing your Niche is breaking down what the automation potential criteria meet to understand this automation potential criteria need to understand what I call the three tiers of AI automation agency Services which start off at no code AI chatbot secondly to low code automations and thirdly to custom automation this concept is one of the key things that I've been piecing together in the run-up to this video in terms of how you as an agency owner can understand the different levels of services and where the entry point is for beginners like you the first thing that you need to understand is that the only option for you guys as beginners who are looking to start your own AI automation Agency for the first time is tier one now why is tier one your only option why are building AI chat Bots your only option as a beginner firstly creating AI chatbots on platforms like bot press is very very very easy and beginner friendly for someone like yourself if you were completely new to building these kind of chat Bots you can learn how to use bot press and start to deliver chatbots to your own clients yourself which means that you don't have to take on extra risk of hiring a developer or hiring someone to deliver these you can completely remove the risk of losing money by delivering themselves and having essentially 100 margins on these on these clients secondly once you've created a chat bot and service their particular client you can then just duplicate it across to your other client within bot risks create a duplicate of the chat bot and then make the changes necessary and then sell it to another client in the early stages of your business being able to copy and paste these Solutions across and sell them for the same price is going to be hugely hugely important for you and since the learning curve to use something like bot process so low once you're up and running you can very easily Outsource this to someone else you can just say hey we've got a new client this is how you duplicate it these are the variables you need to change great and now you can get rid of that and you can start focusing on growing the business and I'd say the most important reason why people should focus on selling these tier one Services as a beginner is because these chat Bots can actually be templated it and given away and and sold and passed around so that you as a beginner you might not even need to create your own first chatbot to start selling you could find someone in the community or you could get one of mine off my resource Hub clone it download it import it into your Bot press make a couple changes and then sell that thing for a thousand two thousand dollars depending on how good your sales skills are so you are all clear that tier one AI chat Bots are the deliverable that you need to be focusing on as a beginner now we can start breaking down what are some options within this AI chat Bots tier one and how can you start to sell them as well so on screen you see the automation potential analysis this is breaking down uh the tier one deliverables of AI chat Bots into five key kinds of chatbots that I recommend you guys look at starting and applying to your own Niche so firstly we have prospecting chat Bots onboarding chat Bots support chat Bots training chat Bots and internal use chat bots on screen here you can see the criteria by which we analyze the automation potential of a niche we do this through having five different types of chat Bots and figuring out if a particular Niche can benefit from them so we can have a prospecting outbot which is when you might go on a website where they're going to collect some lead information we've gone over this earlier in the video when onboarding chat bot is where you're onboarding the clients obviously support chatbot is where you're providing customer Supports to clients a training chatbot is an internal use chatbot where you can load in documents we've been over this as well but the final one I wanted to touch on here is an internal use chat bot for document query so say you have a legal business or a legal firm they might have a lot of documents that they might want to ask questions on so that could be a custom model chatbot that you could create for the internal team of a legal business or maybe you want to put a bunch of sales data into a chatbot and ask questions about the sales data or things like that that is an internal use chat bot where you can ask questions and get answers back which could be a valuable deliverable for one of these niches please do not worry if you're strugging to get all of this down I know it can be complex initially but I actually have a full automation potential analysis framework where I explain each of these different chat Bots and what they look like in different Industries the exact steps on how to implement them and then you can also steal my templates if you want any of that which is going to help you really under understand this key part of the model it's going to be available in my resource Hub Link in the description on screen here you have the automation potential analysis example again this table is going to be available my resource Hub we have the exact same niches as we have before but this time we've expanded up that grayed out column to this entire screen here and we put each of the different chatbot types that I mentioned before on the columns so we have the prospecting onboarding support training and internal what we need to do is analyze each of our niches on the need for each of these different chat bots so we can start with Airbnb management do they have any sort of prospecting requirements are they going to be reaching out to clients and getting information back and forth not really are they going to be onboarding clients sure there's a bit of onboarding required for Airbnb management companies is there support yes there is a ton of support required as a Airbnb management company and they can benefit a lot from it so you need to go through all of these different steps and say smmas do they Prosper yes they do they're on board yes they do do they have any kind of customer support that they can benefit from yes they do and the the output is what you see here on screen and a good example to show how these vary between Industries is e-commerce we have e-commerce doesn't really need a prospecting chatbot to capture lead information and things like this they definitely don't need an onboarding chatbot so the only options you really have is support training and internal so I'll let you take a quick look at that and just see how I've labeled these yes or no I won't go into in too much detail but it's pretty straightforward once we go on from that we have a scoring system so low is zero to two points medium is two to four and high is Five Points so going back to that we see e-commerce has maybe three out of five it may be management four out of five they fall into the different labels and categories here and then after all of that work we have our completed Niche analysis table now with this automation need column filled in So based on the points that they scored in the automation potential analysis we take it over we score them and then we fill it out so this is the same table from earlier but we've filled in that grayed out column now you can look across and get a proper analysis of each of the niches that you've got and start to decide which ones are best for you and which ones you should move forward with here we can see that the restaurant's Niche might not be what we're looking for since it doesn't have money to spend has a low automation need and I'm personally not familiar with it but maybe something like social media marketing agencies could be good but you have lots of money to spend easy to Target and large Market size a high automation need they checked all five of those boxes from the previous screen and I'm also familiar with it so what you need to be doing is get 30 ideas generated with that chat GPT prompt and then you're going to want to lay them out all in a spreadsheet or in a document somewhere and start to go through this process of the move do they have money to spend do are they easy to Target okay now I'm going to bust that out into the automation potential and analyze each of these as what chatbots could they benefit from which of these Tier 1 deliverables of these five different types of chat Bots could they benefit from what I want you to do is start with about 30 of them and then narrow them down to say the next five and then we're going to take those On To The Next Step the next step is my favorite of all which is to create the offer and this is going to be an absolutely crucial step now that you've done all the hard work of getting five exciting niches that take a lot of the boxes for you is to create an offer and this is going to determine whether you flop off the stuff outline or you have an immediate success so pay attention here be taking notes because it's a very very important section the next task for us after we have these five niches we've narrowed down to is to identify the biggest opportunity for each so how do you determine which is the most valuable service for a business this has to be done on a case-by-case basis and this is done by calculating what is the actual Roi of this particular deliverable in this particular Niche you can attempt to quantify the ROI for clients by speaking in terms they understand such as hours saved or full-time equivalents replaced and what we need to do is determine a potential Roi for each of these different kind of chat Bots for each Niche and this is going to vary by industry as you'll see the best way to illustrate this is with a couple examples so for this particular client they had a support team on for 24 hours a day that was three people on doing eight hour shifts each and that was going on for five days per week and that's four weeks per month as well which ended up being 480 hours per month and our chatbot was able to come in and reduce support tickets by I think it was 78 at the end of the day following the implementation of our chatbot they were able to reduce the hours per month by the real support team the humans down to around 105 hours I wanted to show this example because it gives you a very very clear look at how a specific Niche and a specific type of chat bot can combine together to make a very very high impact so a customer support chatbot in the case of an e-commerce store can provide a ton of value whereas in different niches and different Industries customer support chatbot might not provide anywhere near as much value as that now the second example I want to use to help illustrate how you can quantify the ROI for a client as using an onboarding chatbot example in this example the figure that we're going to be targeting to really show the ROI of this particular chatbot is the head of operations hours spent on onboarding new clients per month so typically in service-based businesses like my own company Morningside AI we have our clients who come in the door they sign with us and then they need to be onboarded into our processes into our slack they need to sign contracts all this sort of stuff now typically my head of operations handles that and so for this particular example we'll be looking to decrease the L number of hours that he's spending on that and typically a head of operations or Chief Operating Officer is going to cost quite a lot of money per hour so any hours we can reduce here are going to provide a big impact for the business for example the head of operations could spend two hours onboarding each client and they could onboard two clients per week and maybe we call that nine new clients a month and that comes out to 18 hours by the head of operations onboarding new clients each week if your client's head of operations is on say 70 an hour you can do the maths and figure out what the maximum potential savings you can provide to them are which in this case on screen would be 1 260 per month so that already is a potentially huge benefit to the business and cost savings but that doesn't even factor in additional benefits to an onboarding chat bot light and increase close rate people following through and actually signing contracts and and paying invoices or increase in the sales velocity by reducing the total time for onboarding say it was two weeks now it's three days you can see by the sales velocity format on screen here you're potentially altering not only the win rate but also the length of the sales cycle so this can really speed up a business if you do it right now there's many benefits that you can really sell to the business on to determine which kinds of chatbots can benefit which of your five final niches we need yet another table and again this is going to be available in the resource Hub in the description but we have laid it all out here you can see that I've actually grayed out some of the areas that we know they don't apply so obviously e-commerce businesses don't need prospecting your onboarding chatbots so I've laid them all out and now we can actually analyze which ones can benefit from which the most so Airbnb management onboarding probably not that high impact support potentially a very very high impact and high Roi deliverable for them training maybe low they don't have that many staff the turnover isn't very high and the internal use there's not many documents that they want to be chatting from and the value that you could extract from that isn't very high now if we go to smmas the value of prospecting and helping them attract new clients better and capture information probably about a medium onboarding potentially a very very high Roi because there's so much onboarding that goes on in this mmas that's customer support potentially very high if there's a lot of communication done by the head of operations or developers if you can streamline that you can Save hours that's potentially a huge benefit for the business I'm not going to go through all of these what it does take is a little bit of Common Sense here and being able to say hey it doesn't really have that much of an onboarding process probably not the highest Roi you need to maybe do a little bit of mental math as well and say hey how much volume are they really doing on the support side not much okay okay let's try and look for something else once you've filled all of this out and I know it's another table but you're actually at the point now where you've identified not only a good Niche but also a high value deliverable to sell within that Niche so you're right there another little hack that I want to drop in here that we use within my AAA incubator Community is to actually use templates to create these chatbots and I know I've touched on this earlier in the video but that's actually a key point to be looking for templates because as you're selecting your niches and you're selecting the deliverable there may actually already be a template for that particular Niche and deliverable say a onboarding chatbot for social media marketing agencies if you can find that within my community or find it on my resource Hub then that could actually be a very very good place to start now that you have maybe 10 different specific niches and deliverables that you can choose from maybe you can start to look see if you can find a template for one and then you've narrowed it down even more to maybe three out of ten and they've got a really good place to start you can download that you can buy it off someone and then you can get started using that exact template the absolute best place to look for any templates is going to be in my community or in my resource sub because I have a bunch there as well so you can sign up to both of those in the description and with that I must say a huge congratulations to if you've made it this far you now have that filled out table that I showed you just before any of those niches where they have a high value in any of those you can actually pick one of those now and start to craft your offer so some examples on screen could be onboarding chat Bots for smmas customers support chatbot for e-commerce stores staff training chatbots for restaurants prospecting chat Bots for tax law firms now here you've seen of niched down Beyond just a broad niche of law firms I've gone to tax law firms so if you want to get a little bit more specific on the niche if you've got a really broad Niche you could actually narrow down a little bit more but what I want you to do now is pick one of those as you can see these ones on screen here I've identified the high impact part of the business to attack with the chatbot which is onboarding for smmas customer support for e-commerce stores you need to identify the high impact one as we've done with that table and then write down your Niche and write down your deliverable in the format like this so deliverable for Niche and with your deliverable and chatbot decided we are ready to get into the fun stuff of adding the secret Source now you know I'm a huge fan of Alex mozzie and a lot of the stuff I talk about my videos comes from him and this I'm going to give him full credit for all of the stuff I'm talking about here this is a hundred percent out of his book but I thought I'd slap him on screen here and give them credit where credit is due but we have pricing scarcity urgency bonuses and guarantees these are the secret sauce the icing on the cake that's really going to take what you're offering say onboarding chat Bots for tax law firms and really judge that up and make it a whole lot more appealing and add the stuff that you need to make this thing hit right off the bat when you first launch it into the market Alex from Ozzy always preaches that you should charge as much as possible for the customer for your own benefit but also for theirs because you get more more buy-in from them and they're going to be more attentive to you and more invested and the process but I'm going to sort of go a little bit off script from what he says in this book strictly because I think for you guys right now charging thousands of thousands of dollars for something that you've never delivered before probably isn't the best idea so My Philosophy when it comes to pricing initially is to instead of focusing on how much you can make initially focus on how much you can learn so if you can flip it in your head to where your payment is going to be the learning you get back from the experience you can see on screen here I say when starting out your job is to learn getting paid to learn is the goal that would be great if you can get paid 500 or a thousand dollars to do your first couple of clients and learn and get paid at the same time which is what we did with our company but it's not possible for all people starting out so go at it with a mindset of hey I'd love to make money doing this but if I can't get it then I'm just going to take whatever I can get so that I can get some experience get some testimonials Etc by no means am I saying that you should go and offer your services for free initially but you should go in with a a strong offer that we're crafting right here but you should be prepared if you've found a client who could be a good learning opportunity for you to downsell them and say hey I can do it for XYZ amount or just anything you can do to get in the door and get that first client under your belt but when it comes to setting that initial price what you're leading in with your offer you need to calculate this or a good way to calculate this is to estimate that the return on investment or Roi for the client and base your pricing around that Roi and the amount you're saving them essentially initially if you're working with an e-commerce client and making a customer support chat bot so if you were estimating the savings to be around fifteen hundred dollars per month for them based on the number of hours their customer support team wouldn't have to do you could charge them a thousand dollars and this comes back to the idea that homology talks about a lot and other other direct marketers as well which is you're trying to sell them a hundred dollars for twenty dollars so we're selling them fifteen hundred dollars a month of savings for one thousand dollars fixed so you're selling them a hundred dollars for twenty dollars it's an irresistible offer it's something that they it doesn't even make sense for them to turn down so especially in this example where it's going to be a monthly cost so you're saving them at fifteen hundred dollars recurring monthly fee and then you're going to charge them a single one thousand dollar setup fee you're giving them a great deal of selling a hundred dollars twenty dollars so when it comes to pricing your offer a good guideline is going to be that Roi that you provide to the client and doing a bit of napkin mathematics to figure out hey what are the potential savings that I can provide to them and I'm going to fall beneath that and and that's an irresistible offer for them in some Industries and deliverables you may need to actually get in touch with some of these business owners and get a bit of feedback and say how much time are you spending on this okay okay that's great and you take a couple data points down and you use that to base your future prices off now another aspect of pricing is of course your pricing structure what are the terms around the payment and how are you actually going to be collecting that money so there's a few options here we have 100 up front which is quite confident that not a lot of clients especially if you're taking on your first ones will be comfortable with 100 up front but then there's compromises like 50 up front and 50 on completion and you have things like a fixed setup fee so say I'll set up the chatbot for one thousand dollars and then I have a monthly retainer of say 300 for maintenance and Improvement or you could do something like a free setup and they only pay if they're happy with it which is what we're going to touch on later in terms of guarantees and things like that so there's lots of different options you can even build in by you usage should say if you have it on your Bot press or your stack AI account you can see how much usage is going through on that particular application and then you can build them based on that and Mark it up and that kind of thing that's the basics of pricing out of the way now we can jump into scarcity which is a hugely important aspect of your offer and if you're not putting some elements of scarcity in it you're basically asking do you have a hard time going out and trying to sell those things so you have to get some kind of element of this inside whether it's artificial or Genuine trust me it's a lot easier if it's genuine scarcity than than artificial but some of you might need to get a little bit creative on that side of things and and really factor in some some scarcity into this on screen is some examples of tried and tested scarcity methods such as we're only going to accept x amount of clients full stop so we only work with 10 at a time you can only get enough one of them drops off so we're fixed and we only do 10 people at once we can do a cohort based system like the second Point here which is we only accept two clients per week or we only accept five new clients per month so there's a waiting list and that's sort of a staggered release and they've got a B on that five will be on that two per week or per month to get it another method that is great that can kind of be an umbrella term over all of these which is just having a waiting list or saying that you're sold out and people can get on the waiting list and then you can notify them when the spots open up so having a waiting list or appearing to be sold out is another key thing and ideally you are sold out so that you have some genuine demand built up and genuine scarcity and the final one that I've put on here I thought I'd throw on to show you that scarcity can also come in sort of different forms in the above examples we're saying we only accept this or there's a strict limit on this this and how many clients are coming in but this last Point here of saying I specialize in doing X for why businesses means that you are scarce and the fact that you are a expert you have narrowed down who you work for and you can provide services to making you an expert or making you a scarce resource you're the only one of five in the world who can provide these services for someone so that in itself is another form of scarcity I mean Alex mozzie does touch on this on his books as well and this is another reason why I say it is so important for beginners to Niche down to at least in industry but ideally a deliverable as well so that you can appear to be an expert and be a scarce resource onboarding chatbot specialist for the tax law firms that is so scarce there's not many people like that on the earth so when you make an offer to them it feels like you are in higher demand than some generalist and then we have the close cousin to scarcity which is urgency this of course is more related to time and trying to get people to buy now rather than later this is an issue going to run into all the time with clients delaying saying I need to talk to other people this this and this if you can add some kind of time urgency factor and make them by now rather than later you can have a much higher success rate in turning leads into clients there's a few ways you can do this first so you can have some sort of discount or special offer that's only available for today or this week for example you can say that we have our spring sale ending at the end of the week if you want to get on that that price is only available until the end of the week if you buy after you're gonna have to pay the full price another great way that hamasi mentions in his books is to let your customers know that the prices are going up now this can be artificial or it can be genuine this can work very very well but as from Aussie says in his book every time you increase prices you need to let your customers know so you need to blast out communication via email or SMS to not only the leads that you didn't close that have gone cold but also to your past clients that you're trying to re-engage with new services and product offerings seasonal promotions can be a great way to dress up a regular promotion and get give it a little bit more credibility if you compare a generic and sort of arbitrary discount or offer say 20 off for the next two weeks ending on Monday that's very arbitrary and it doesn't have much credibility but if you compare that to Fan Easter sale and say we're running our Easter sale until the end of Easter this is going to be 30 off and you can have a much more credible deadline and so people know when it's coming up and you can rinse and repeat this and say a spring sale or a Halloween sale and things like this and it adds more credibility to your discount it's a clear deadline and so it pushes more urgency onto the client and the final way that I'll cover in this video is to have some sort of sign up now to get into the XYZ cohort so say you have a new bag starting on Monday and it's a Thursday you can say if you sign up now I can get you into the the Monday cohort when we start the next group if you don't sign up now I'm gonna have to give that spot to someone else and you'll have to wait another week or two or month however along your cohort sort of rolling system is they'll have to wait until that so if they want to get it now they have to pay now and then we have bonuses which can be a great way to couple with your urgency and offer them these special bonuses if they purchase now but they work in tandem a lot of the time for example you can increase the value of your offer by throwing things in specifically if you're offering chat Bots for say a free month of Maintenance and Improvement if you buy today or you buy this week or I'll do a free one hour workshop with me to assess other areas in AI other areas that AI can help your business so say I'm going to throw in a free hour-long Workshop which is an AI audit and that's a bit of extra value and business owners right now are really really interested in getting an AI audit done and having a bit of peace of mind so you're throwing in this hour-long Workshop that can give them complete Peace of Mind of where they sit in terms of all this AI stuff and how they're opposed to to benefit or how they're supposed to lose from it and as I say here expanding the service offering over time will make the bonuses easier to do so at the moment when you start out if you're listening to what I'm telling you to do you will only have one Niche and you have one deliverable so it's a little bit harder to upsell and throw in different and services apart from these maintenance improvements and hour-long workshops and things like that but as soon as you've got some experience and working with these clients and you've started to identify different upsells you can add and you've got your team to go and figure out how we can do this so I want to add this feature to our chatbot or I want to add the zapier connection to the chatbot so once you have those kind of upsells you can start to add those in and say hey look I'll throw in a freeze API integration that's going to generate a personalized Outreach method for you based on your prospecting chatbot over time you're going to have more of these to potentially upsell and throw in as bonuses and the final Point here as I mentioned before you can use these as an urgency lever you're trying to put it on top of the urgency layer that you've just put in which is you get a free month if you sign up today or I'll throw in this free one hour Workshop if you sign up today so combine your bonuses with your urgency if need be so that you can really combine the effects of both and the final step that I'm going to cover in this video is guarantees which is going to be hugely important for you guys starting out being a completely new business and a new service provider it's hard to get the credibility you don't have the backup and results to really show yourself and show you show your expertise so having a guarantee that protects the buyer not only protects them but kind of goes above and beyond it's going to make selling a ton easier for you guys so there's obviously a number of different ways you can provide a guarantee money back guarantee refund trial period all these sort of things these are quite sort of standard and regular and a lot of the ways that you're probably thinking of right now that you could run guarantees are not really strong enough but on screen here we have a couple examples of guarantees from Alex modi's book we have firstly the results-based guarantee which is you will achieve X results and wide time or we're going to compensate why and you have a value added guarantee which is if you're unsatisfied we're not only going to refund you but we're going to give you more than that so it's compensating the business owner for their time wasted yeah you might give them their money back but business owners time is valuable and expensive so you want to ensure that they are going to get something out of it if you don't do what you say you can do and finally another really good one for you guys who are looking to learn rather than earn which is a performance oriented guarantee and you say hey you're only going to have to pay for a product if you're happy with it so I'll make you a chat bot I'll install it in your business and with this you're obviously relying quite heavily on social norms and social using that if someone is really happy with the service it's sort of a expectation by society that you should give the money you're sort of throwing out the bait and you're saying look here's my product here's if you like it please you can pay me whenever but only if you like it so if they like it chances are 1995 of clients are going to say yes I like it and pay the money because they're running a business they have to have some sort of Integrity a lot of the time but you might get five percent ten percent of people who are scumbags and they're going to try and run away with your money and your products so just be aware of that but it is worth it that kind of guarantee will attract a lot of the right and wrong people but you'll definitely get enough within that to start making money we've added all of the aspects of the secret source to make your offer stand out so now it's a case of putting it all together bringing in all of these aspects of scarcity urgency guarantees Etc and adding them on top of your offer and putting it together so here we have the first example of a customer service chat bot for e-commerce stores and this is what it might look like if you were planning out your own offer using these elements we've just covered firstly we have the niche of e-commerce stores we have the deliverable of a customer support chat bot then we have the benefits or key objectives what what is the value being provided to the business here primary which is to reduce the customer support rep hours which is a clear Roi for the business and it's also good to throw in some secondary benefits such as increasing the customer satisfaction and reviews and particularly for e-commerce this is going to go for trust pilot the customers aren't being responded to in a timely manner and getting the responses they need then your scores on not only your own website but also on trustpilot and things like that could really be hurt and tank the the conversion rate a lot of the time then we have the pricing structure which I put here as a 997 setup fee plus 300 per month retainer for maintenance and Improvement I'm going to touch on how maintenance and Improvement packages can work and how you can structure a retainer offer a little bit later in the video but for now just know that this one is a 997 setup fee with a 300 per month maintenance and Improvement package there are no element of scarcity on this one is that we're only going to be taking in three clients for the month of July so we've got one squat filter ready let me know when you're ready to sign up and you can get one of those last two remaining and then the real trick here is the urgency and bonuses combination here of if you purchase today I'll give you your first month of Maintenance and Improvement it's free so that's a three hundred dollar value add to them or savings to them if they're able to purchase today and finally to wrap it all up you can put a big juicy guarantee on there look you don't even pay the 997 unless you're happy with what I set up so with all of these aspects put together the urgency the scarcity the pricing structure clearly communicating the benefits and a guarantee that basically it makes it no risk for them this is an example of a really good and really strong offer that you could start to run with and I'm going to give you another example here of a staff training chat bot for logistics companies obviously the niches and logistics companies we have the deliverable of a staff training chat bot then the benefit or objective of the chat bot the ROI we're seeking to provide is firstly the primary would be to reduce hours required to onboard new hires if you think about it a little bit you might be able to figure out why I've paired logistics companies with staff training chat Bots again this is going back to our method previously of trying to identify okay what does logistics companies what could they potentially need in terms of the five types of chat Bots we have okay now which one of those is actually going to provide the most value and in this case for this just for companies they've had very high staff turnovers so training new staff training new people who are working on the floor of the company are going to be very very helpful and very beneficial so there's a lot of time spent training new highs and the churn of new highs in these industries is very high and I have a secondary benefit on here of actually increasing the quality and accuracy of work by all employees when you have potentially hundreds of new hires each year by having some sort of chat bot that these new highs can talk to is going to allow them a way to get information when they need it and do the job correctly ensuring less issues and less mistakes by these new hires and overall increase in the quality and accuracy of the work done by all of these employees then when it comes to pricing here I've put it at 14.97 for the setup fee plus a 500 per month retainer for maintenance and Improvement so I'd expect a lot of these companies who have updates to their knowledge base to their training documents so having that sort of retainer added in there is going to allow them to continually make changes to it and improvements over time for scarcity I've used a waitlist so I've said look we're sold out right now but I can put you on the waitlist and notify you when a spot is open so I might email them and say hey look you have 24 hours to get back to me if you want to secure the spot if not it's going to the next person or something like that and then the real magic within this offer is this urgency and bonuses combination of if you purchase today I will waive the setup fee so you can see I've pumped the setup fee up to a 1500 price point then when you combine it with the urgency and bonuses it's a lot more attractive so well I get to waive this 1500 setup fee but the retainer is higher so you can play around with that price anchoring and stuff here but this is a a pretty good way to structure it if you increase that setup fee and increase the retainer as well and then finally I've added a guarantee that similar to the last one but in this case you're actually getting the retainer free if the team isn't happy with the chat bot and it's not providing what they need to get from it I've thrown in this slide here to give you an example of what it might look like when you convert all of that information all those sort of bullet points into some copy now this isn't great this was done in a couple of minutes but you get the idea which is I build customer support chat Bots for e-commerce stores that eliminate up to 80 of repetitive customer support queries my clients typically save XYZ amount per month after my system is installed the setup fee for my system is 800 with a 300 monthly retainer and Improvement fee I'm accepting only four clients in the month of July if you sign up today I'll waive my setup fee so taking it from the the strictly laying out how the offer is constructed through how you're going to actually write this and and communicate it to the client so this is a good starting point you might need to do a little bit more uh adjustments on it to make it really hit with all of that out of the way you should now be able to get a similar layout to what I've just shown you in those examples of what's Manish what's my deliverable what's my pricing structure Etc write that down in your notebook and try to do it a couple different ways maybe even go back a few steps and grab some different ones and experiment on say okay maybe I want to do a prospecting chatbot for social media marketing agencies and try to do some experimentation on offers for that until you really find one that you're happy with and you think it's going to provide a lot of value now that you have those and you've picked your favorite we can get stuck into lead generation how are you going to find clients that you can potentially sell to thankfully lead generation is actually a lot easier than you think and it's a question that I get asked all the time in my community but as a beginner there's a few different methods you you can go over and we're going to cover them in this video firstly LinkedIn search is a great way to find potential leads now the LinkedIn method I'm going to teach here is great for getting started firstly if you have the sales Navigator which is the linkedin's way of searching up companies it's more of an advanced research tool if you can get sales Navigator it is quite expensive I think there's a free trial use that if possible if you have the resources it's going to be better but in this video I'm going to cover the free method that doesn't require the sales Navigator if you do have the sales navigator at the same principles apply but it's going to be a little bit easier to find what you're looking for for the method for you guys just looking to get started would be to head to LinkedIn search up your niche as you can see on this this image here I've searched up Tax Lawyer and I've actually narrowed it down so you want to start to filter it by location by industry title or company size as well so company size is available only in the sales Navigator I believe that's not something you'll be able to do on the free one but firstly maybe you want to narrow down by United States as you see I've done here and I've narrowed down here by Legal Services as the industry and on screen you can see there's a couple results that came up already you can also narrow down by title and you can say CEO or founder and so you can try to find the extra decision makers and the real point of contact for these businesses you can pull up the results that look good into a new tab and then for each of them you can check the contact info section so on LinkedIn basically everyone has a contact info section so you can click on that and ideally they have the email or phone number or some kind of contact Point that's direct to them but if they don't you can use something like get Prospect or any of the other tools that allow you to basically look up emails and look up contact information based off the company of person for example the company name or leave you find might be johnsmithlegal.com tools I get Prospect are going to be able to look up and see if there's a if there's a John John Smith legal.com and then you can use that email in your lead so once you get that information off get Prospect or you just get it straight out of the contact info section you can create a Google sheet and you can start to add these in as leads you can say the name contact info business any kind of like website information as much info as you can have on them and add that to a row in your sheet method number two which is tried and tested as well is to use Facebook groups firstly you can just search your Niche so in this case I've searched up tax law firms or just illegal firms and of course you need to apply to join these so I would join a bunch of these here we have lawyers groups we have tax professionals helping each other I'd try to join them you might have to lie a little bit to get in and once you're inside you need to start looking for the members section sometimes you won't actually be able to view all of the members so instead you're just going to have to look at the Active participants who's commenting who's liking who's posting the process from there is to open up their profile in a new tab and then you can have a quick look at the info depending on the privacy settings you might be able to see uh Sarah Smith works at sarahsmithlegal.com CEO and founder if she doesn't have contact info on Facebook or anywhere within the group you can go and search LinkedIn and try to find her on LinkedIn and use the same process as before so Facebook you're going to collect a bunch of people who are potentially meet the criteria of being decision makers or owners of small legal firms and I'm using the legal example just for some sort of consistency here I hope you understand that you can replace this with whatever your Niche that you're working in and then then go over to LinkedIn get the information off their profile or using get Prospect or another tool and then add it to a sheet in the exact same way so your goal here is when you're collecting these leads is to just get a big sheet for of all of them you can start to outreach to or email and SMS and whatever you're going to do with them next and the last method I'm going to cover in this video is a local business search which is probably going to be the best option for a lot of you people watching this right now super simple all you need to do is go to Google Maps search for your Niche and click the information and add it to a sheet it's not rocket science at all you guys should be able to get hundreds and hundreds of leads within your own industry so for example on here I've just searched up Tax Lawyer and it's given me a whole bunch of Tech Law places within Dusseldorf which is where I'm at at the moment and there seems to be a ton in one city so you can just do this over and over and over again with this you're able to search by city or by country for say Dental practices and start to pick all of these leads they're going to have the contact information on there because it's a Google Business posting so you can grab their contact number which is great for cold calling which we're going to cover later or you can go onto their website and figure out what their support email is or figure out who the business owner is and get in touch with them do the same LinkedIn thing bunch of different things you can do once you've found a business on here but again you need to be getting all of that info over into a lead sheet once you have a big old list of leads then the next step is to reach out them contact them and that is called Outreach I thought I'd cover some basic principles for outreach here for you guys who are completely new to this so first of all and the most important thing you need to keep in mind is that you need to be selling the meeting and not the service so you shouldn't be trying to go for the throat and say I have this thing you need to buy it this is why why but you need to come in with and say hey I have this thing you may be interested in it do you want to maybe hop on a call and have a chat and I could tell you how you could apply it to your business and how it could benefit you you're selling a low risk commitment of hopping on a call and they can ideally take the information that you give them on the call and go somewhere else with it so it's not specific to you another key thing that's going to really increase the response rate of your Outreach is to hook them in by providing Value First and this is actually a sort of psychological trick because it engages the reciprocity principle and and social Norm of when someone gives you something you want to give them something back and if they don't do that then they feel like a bad person so you can play on that on reciprocity factor and by giving some value and saying hey I've just done a full AI audit of your website here's how I think you could do this and this if you want to up in a call with me okay so you can book in a call I don't know what Niche you're working in I don't know what chap what you're doing so you're going to need to think about what kind of value can I throw into an email or a cold call or something like that to provide value and then expect something in return later down the line also keep your Outreach short and sweet a business owner is not going to spend 10 minutes reading your Outreach they don't care if you can't get to the point within a few sentences or a few words ideally they're not going to read it and you're not going to get any responses so short sweet break it up into line by line so it's not a big wall of text and you should be going in the right direction and this goes back to making this Outreach method and potential encounter with a client as low risk or low commitment as possible so firstly you don't want any risk on their hands they should just be able to hop on there not spend anything not have to do anything other than give their time but you want to make that time commitment at law as possible so hey do you have 60 seconds for me to just explain what what I do for businesses like you and how I've helped them previously or you can say in your email Outreach hey look we can open a 5-10 minute call I can run through this all quickly I've got everything prepared for you let me know if you want to book in and we can get this done the first method of Outreach that I'm going to be covering is cold calling and I know that probably sounds terrifying to you but there's a number of reasons why you have to do this in your business at least at the start cold calling is fantastic for you as a new business owner because this is a very very quick and efficient way to get instant feedback from your target market now this goes back to what I was saying in the mindset section of don't make assumptions you need to test this offer you need to get feedback from real people real participants in the market in order to verify what you're doing so you can start to allocate more resources so you don't want to put all your resources in one bucket or go all in one offer and build a whole click funnels landing page or build a massive website Build A team out build a get office space you don't want to go all in until you've at least had some kind of feedback from the market that people are interested in this so cold calling is a great way to do this you can really call up 10 businesses in 10 minutes and get instant feedback on what you're offering them and more importantly understanding the kind of common questions and objections you're going to get when you're trying to sell a chatbot to a specific Niche it is so crucial that you learn those objections and learn what people are going to push back on then you're going to be able to piece together what information these people need in order to make a decision that's going to result in a purchase so I absolutely have to do this if you want to run this business in a way that's data backed and actually getting real data from the market before you make decisions you need to be doing at least some form of cold calling at the start to really fast track your success I would say if you're just going to stick to emails and things like that you're not going to get that real-time feedback from the market I know a lot of you guys are going to say oh but I'm shy I have social anxiety I don't care and the market doesn't care and if you want to make any money you need to get over that and it's just calling up a person how bad could it really be you're not even looking at them just call them get some feedback and go back to your business and start making some money get over it and there's even secondary benefits that come from cold cooling like building confidence speaking as a business owner this is a skill that you need to develop if you're never going to get on cold calls with clients the only time you're going to practice speaking is when you have a qualified hot lead who's ready to sign and if you hop on that call and sound like an idiot or you don't have any kind of professionalism and you can't beat your words out you're not going to close that client so why not learn on the the people who aren't clients who aren't even one warm leads yet and just get familiar with speaking to people on the phone and pitching your services you need to learn the stuff you can't just read a book on it you have to actually do it so if I could recommend anything and I know only five percent of you gonna probably do this but set some kind of quota on how many cold calls you need to do a day and just see it as learning don't go I need to be closing these clients just you need to get familiar with talking to clients you need to get familiar with pitching or Services you need to get familiar with what pushback you're going to get from people so that you can start the closing this is absolutely key and so I know only some of you are going to do it but set a quota and just start picking up that phone every day and start calling and don't try to give me the excuse of what I can't call XYZ because I don't have a plan that allows me to do that get Skype get some calling credit and spend 10 bucks on it and you're going to be able to make calls all around the world and start to close some clients when it comes to a script for cold calling I have a super basic example on screen here there's a number of different ways you can skin this cat and I'm going to actually have a bunch of cold calling script examples on my resource Hub also for cold email so if you want to get access to some scripts and some templates that you can start to roll with and test on your Market those are going to be available in the description in my resource hub and there was to be some floating around in the sales channel of my Discord with this example you could hop on the phone and say hey XYZ I've just worked with another client in your industry and we've got some really great results for them I was wondering if you'd be interested in getting something similar set up for your business we make AI onboarding chat Bots for social media marketing agencies would you be interested or would you have a couple minutes do you have 60 seconds for me to tell you a little bit more about it and then boom and if they say yes you give them a quick breakdown of the systems and the benefits it can provide such as my onboarding chatbot will shrink your onboarding sales process on average by 60 you're going to have much higher sales velocity and you're going to have a much higher close rate XYZ once you've had a chance to explain how your product works and the kind of benefits they might see from it within the industry you can start to move them towards getting them on the next call which again is what you're selling you can say to them if this sounds at all interesting to you I'd be happy to hop on a free 15-minute AI audit Workshop call with you and just go over your business and the systems and processes you have currently and how we can potentially get something similar set up for you in your business and the key part here is to book that next AI audit call or Workshop call while you're on that cool so throw it a couple times we'll ask them hey what time's work for you next week okay great I'll pencil that and you can also ask them for an email that you can send an invitation to so you can book it in both of your calendars as I said there's just one example of how you could potentially run your cold calls if you want more scripts and more examples like this they're going to be developing my resource Hub as I mentioned the other method of cold Outreach that I'm going to cover is of course cold email now if you're new to online business and you haven't done any sort of Outreach before you probably don't know that you can't just email people willy-nilly off a random Gmail that you create you actually need to warm up the domain to ensure that you're delivering the the emails you're not being marked as spam you're getting direct to the inbox or the person you're looking to get in contact with and before you start blasting out emails to the leads that you've just collected and getting straight to the spam box and and screwing up the deliverability of your domain and all the email that you used you need to use something like instantly.ai to warm up your domain instantly it's by far the best option in the industry right now for this I'm actually friends with the founder of instantly so I'm happily plugging it on here for you guys to use because I know how much work he puts into creating this platform and it's really really the gold standard in the industry right now once you have your domain warmed up you're ready to start a basic three-step email campaign the first email is going to be similar to the cold calling script and that you can lead in and say hey I've worked with XYZ competitor or XYZ in your industry and we built this for them and we got these results then you can cut straight to the Chase and say something like if this at all sounds interesting to you I'm happy to hop on a free Workshop or free AI audit call with you and analyze where this could fit into your business and what benefit we can provide a few days after that and if you still haven't got a response you can send the reminder email just saying hey I haven't heard from you wondering if you're still interested or you might be interested in these Services then email three is a hey it seems like you're not interested I'll take you off my list and I'll stop emailing you now now this example is very basic and will likely have quite a low hit rate but it's a good place to get started you've got the not only the lead in email but two follow-ups to potentially increase the response rate on this campaign now as I said I do have a cheat sheet for outreach that's available on my resource Hub on there are a bunch more examples of cold calling scripts but also email campaign templates as well so you can take either of those start running them today in your own business if you want to get instant access to those who can sign up to my resource Hub in the description and also join my community for any help and go into the sales Channel and have a chat with people about how to refine your sales scripts for your particular business and deliverable and Niche once you have generated your leads you've reached out to them you've gotten some responses back you've got on some of those audit calls and you have a client that's ready to sign then you can step into the service delivery section that we're covering now in this section of Service delivery and when you actually get to signing and delivering your first client it's going to become so much clearer as to why I'm so insistent on You niching Down by narrowing down to one Niche and one deliverable you drastically simplify Your Service delivery method because you're only going to be working with one specific type of chat bot and once you have it set up on your first client you're able to copy and paste it over to others and repeat the process over and over and over again minimizing any of this this discovery and experimentation phase that you have to go through with new clients and new Industries and things like that all you need in order to get to this point is to have some sort of prototype where you've gone into bot press and stack Ai and you've made a prototype save your onboarding chat bot or you've prototyped with a staff training chat bot what with a custom mileage base that you created and with that you're able to go to clients and say hey here's a prototype of it what I'm going to do when we sign is going to adapt this to your business and then I'll be able to deliver that value to you with it if you're really smart about it you might not even need to create it yourself you'll be able to use templates from my community or from my resource Hub and the key Point here is that you have a prototype to show to the client send a little loom video and as soon as you get onto their business and you're working with them you have real data and real examples to actually build this whole thing out and here we have another little hack for my AAA incubator community and this is contracts now writing a contract that not only serves your client well but also protects your business from any liability and things like this it's important to get the right contract to cover yourself in these situations getting a good contract can be difficult and expensive for beginners so all my resource Hub I have an example of a contract that you're going to be able to use that we've used previously at Morningside that covers a lot of the important aspects and you're going to be able to download that and start using it without having to worry about anything so if you need to get access to that it's available in my resource Hub in the description as I mentioned before when you've got off the call with a client and they're ready to move forward what you need to get a contract sent over to them so you can take for example the template I just mentioned on my resource Hub modified a little bit so it's ready to go with the information that you've discussed on the course you can send that contract over to them for signing with a software called DocuSign and then once that's all signed you can send them an invoice with stripe you're going to need to set up a stripe account if it's available in your country once it's set up you can create an invoice on stripe and you can send them a link to pay then once everything has been paid and the money has been received you can go ahead and create what's called a slack workspace slack is a communication software that we use at Morningside and it's Philly industry standard across any kind of Service delivery business once both you and the client are inside that slack Channel then you can request your requirements so say if you're doing a staff training chat what you can say hey I need the the FAQs or the staff training documents or if it's an onboarding chatbot you can say I need a document that explains your onboarding process so I can start to plan together and piece together what your onboarding Chapel is going to look like and then you need to actually do the work you need to deliver the service and I know I'm kind of skipping over a big part here but I can't give you 10 tips and tricks on how you can do it you just need to build what you said you're going to build and what you sold them on ideally you've had a prototype chatbot as I mentioned and now you're just going to be basically setting up with their business and making a couple tweaks and then you're good to go and you can pass that off as I say here you can deliver it for review and then go back and forth and iterate until they're happy with it key thing here as you're delivering these Services is to keep a copy or a download of the safer to bot press chatbot download that template or upload it to your own press account so that you have a couple examples and you have a backlog and you start to build sort of a catalog or a library of all of these different chat Bots as it says on screen here you will see some variation within an industry of course for example an onboarding chatbot for one business will be a certain way and an onboarding chatbot for another will be slightly different but they will have similarities so what you want to do in order to further streamline Your Service delivery and really speed up and be ready to deliver anything at the sort of blink of an eye you want to start to build up this Library so that whenever a client comes in and say hey we use this for our Communications and we use this for our CRM you're like okay I've got that I've actually done someone before I can just take that copy and paste it over okay that's that's basically a whole lot closer than this other one so very helpful to build up this catalog and library and this is really going to speed up your service delivery on the long term kpis and testimonials are an important thing to keep in mind as you're delivering your services so as I say early on you desperately need to get results that you can use as evidence so when you start a project you need to be collecting some data points say if it's a customer support chat bot for logistics companies you need to collect okay how much time are your managers spending on trading new stuff what's the average hours required by a manager to onboard a new hire or using the example on screen say we spend 20 hours per week on customer support as an e-commerce store when you finish the project and when you've delivered your service you should really only be tying off that project and ending things with that client when you've actually moved the needle because you're going to need that data point of okay this is what it started as and this is what it ended as and then you can take that data point and start to use it in your marketing materials and say here are our results and furthermore Beyond just collecting data points so you can use as your proof of results off offering potentially a discounted rate or just asking the client after you're done if they're really happy with the service if you can get a written or a video testimonial that you can add on your web page and use new marketing materials this is extremely important because the only way that you're going to be able to start charging more and more and more for your services is when you can increase the perceived chance of success of your offer so as there are more and more testimonials and proof that you're able to deliver and get certain results clients are going to be thinking in their head okay these guys are more and more credible they've gotten more and more people just like me results I'm willing to pay more for that service because I have a higher perceived chance of success I'm willing to pay more because I'm more confident that they're able to get exactly the results that they're talking about this of course was taken directly from Alex homazi's value equation so again credit where credit is due this is his concept and finally for those of you who are still here you're obviously and that few percent of people who are actually going to take action on this information and start to make real money with this I wanted to throw in a bit of advice on how to scale to 10K per month and Beyond and give you a bit of an idea of where you're going to be moving in the long term now I don't want you to get too hung up on a lot of this stuff what you need to focus on initially is selling your specific deliverable in a specific Niche to a specific Avatar and selling that over and over and over again and getting really good uh results and testimonials on that particular on that particular offer and once you're up to speed with that and you are doing around ten thousand dollars per month a lot of these things can start to come into play that will help you get beyond that Mark firstly as you'd expect upsells and actually expanding your offering is a great way to begin to increase the aov or lifetime value of your clients so as you deliver Services you will start to see opportunities for upsells so say I'm selling my onboarding chatbot to smma so I've done that a couple of times I've started to see hey maybe I could add this on or maybe this feature could be cool as I say here the best place to start when thinking about upsells and expanding your offering is to actually focus on adding more features into the chatbots you're selling it's not going completely unrelated and going I'm going to jump into zp now and start doing all these crazy Integrations no you are niched down to providing a specific chat bot to a specific industry you need to start looking at how you can make that a better chat bot and make it do more things before you start getting distracted on other things so for example if I had an Airbnb customer support chat bot that I was selling to Airbnb management companies I would say go to one of my clients or one of my old clients to say hey what we've been working on is a new feature that allows you to sell local activities through the chatbot that we've already made for you now if you're interested in this we we have it all ready to go we can start to build it in this is going to cost you six seven hundred dollars a thousand dollars whatever you want to charge for it and then you can start to build that into your service offering and have that either as an upsell and say once you've got a client in the door or before you even sign the contract you could say this is my fixed fee for the basic one if you want to have local activities feature included there could be an extra 500 or you can have those as sort of dry powder and ammunition for your bonuses as I mentioned before so you can say I'll throw in the local activities feature so you can generate more income for the particular property I'm going to throw that in as a bonus if you buy today so expanding the functionality of the chatbot initially is going to be the best place to start but then after that once you've really fleshed out a chatbot as much as you would really want to I would say start looking up and down the business now by up and down the business I mean looking at where your chatbot fit into the business say it's an onboarding chat bot for social media marketing agencies hmm okay what happens before that okay what happens after that and that's what I mean by looking up and down the business or or left and right through the business I think up and down is better we'll go there looking up and down a business can be a great way to expand your service offering within your Niche and saying okay I'm handling the onboarding here I want to go one step back and say okay how can I help them generate contracts okay maybe I can look at creating hiring a developer and getting a contract generation system setup what happens after onboarding okay that's Service delivery what about the service delivery for social media marketing agencies could I assist with some sort of AI offering maybe a Blog content or or content creation Assistance or Facebook ad copy creation or things like this so once you've got the chatbot maxed out you can start to look left and right or up and down up and down the business and say okay maybe I can start to go towards the the Outreach side of things or I can go towards the contracts or I could go further Downstream to a service delivery so think about it that way but as I say here do not rush into this do not get distracted from what you're selling as soon as you start spreading yourself too thin and trying to handle a whole bunch of things at once you lose the power of being a specialist for your particular industry so I make onboarding chat Bots with social media marketing clients there's so much power in that statement of saying I do X for y kinds of business and get Z kind of results you can become the number one service provider in that particular Niche and if you pick something big like onboarding for social media marketing agencies that is a huge market and you can really start to make some serious money if you stay Niche down on that but then just attach all of your other offers behind it you know you're not trying to blur it on the front and say hey we do all these things keep with that really powerful offer of we do onboarding chatbots for smas and then you can sort of upsell them on different things afterwards what I'm saying is keep the missing streamline and keep doing what has been working I do want to touch on retainers here because it is a question that I get a lot from people in comments on my YouTube videos and in my community as well when it comes see retainers within an AI automation agency it's a little bit more difficult than something like smma you really have to craft a special offer and really be an expert in your Niche you can't come and as an amateur as a beginner and start to offer some sort of retainer package it's just not feasible and and it will be very very difficult and overwhelming if you try to do that as beginners the only kind of retainers that you want to be looking at doing is some sort of Maintenance and Improvement packages where you create a chat bot for a company say I make a staff training chat bot for a logistics company and I say hey look you might want to make changes over time you might want to add new information into the training that sort of thing is going to take time for me to edit so what I can do is you can pay me 300 400 500 a month not only and I'm going to maintain it and make those updates but I can also do improvements on it and whenever you want maybe one new feature I can throw in one new feature a month when I get other features from my clients and the things that I'm seeing in the space I'm happy to add on one more feature a month for you doing that so that's how you can kind of structure it maintenance and Improvement package and it is a great way to get some kind of Baseline income for your business so that if you don't get any contracts you're still are going to be making money and this is great for people who are looking to equip their job especially and I will say these retainers can actually be pretty lucrative if you have some kind of client that you can sell multiple chat bots on say it's a Airbnb manager and they have tons and tons of properties you can say okay for each property I'm going to throw on an extra 50 or 100 per month so suddenly you have a thousand dollars or 1500 a month retainer because you're managing 20 properties so keep an eye out for opportunities like that and if you can sell your clients on it then definitely pitch it to them at least now while I don't recommend it for beginners at all there is actually a retainer only based variant of the AI automation agency model which asset Morningside at testing right now and we've just released our beta test for it as you can see on screen here we have a monthly quarterly and yearly package so people are able to work with us as partners on an ongoing basis and they're paying us monthly and we're doing sort of an ongoing analysis of their business and plugging in different things and building new chatbots for them here and integrating it here and adding new features so it's a constant scope of work and it's a very very different different way of delivering services to contract only basis which is what I want you to start with this retainer only variant of the AI automation agency model is unique to what we're doing at Morningside here so if you guys should see very soon on the channel a bit more of an update on on what we're doing here and how we're actually running it so if you want to stay tuned for that you can subscribe to the channel because I've got a video covering exactly how we're doing this which is coming out soon and as I said and I'll say it again this is not for beginners this is not what you should be focused on right now I thought I'd just throw it in there to show you where you could potentially take this model and the kind of fee structure and revenue you could potentially be generating with a full team and a better understanding of the entire scope of the model of course if you have a business and you'd like to supercharge your systems with AI and work with me and my team there's a link in the description where you can sign up and get in contact with us another important part of you getting to that 10K point and Beyond is you start building out your team and now you can actually get a lot of work done with a team of two to three developers so all it takes is a couple good highs and then you're really Off to the Races with being able to deliver on a large scale especially if you've listened to me and you're selling one deliverable to one Niche to one Avatar you can just copy and paste things over those two three Developers can get a lot of work done a question that I get a lot on my weekly q and A's on my Discord is where can I hire do I go on upwork how can I find people who have a skill set that can deliver these kind of chat Bots and things like this so the best place in fact is actually inside my community we have three to four thousand people within my Discord who have labeled themselves as developers alone so we are by far the best community if you're looking to hire all you need to do is get into the community and post on the job board and say hey I'm looking for two bot press developers or two chatbot developers if you're interested please flip me a DM and you'll get a ton of responses and this is a really really great way for you to meet co-founders on our co-founder board but also to hire people as salesmen as bot press developers as has anything you need you can post on the job support in the community and there's just thousands and thousands of people in there who are looking to to get involved as well so as I said you can hire from within my community which is the hot spot for botbs developers at this point or you can train one yourself and you can take a full stack developer and say here's some elim's videos here's some examples learn how to use this particular platform and then I'm going to be able to pay you XYZ dollars per hour once you've made a couple highs and you have your team set up then you need to be thinking very very carefully about creating standard operating procedures or Sops Sops are absolutely crucial in any business and your job as the business owner is to create these systems so something that you've probably never done before if you haven't run a business is to plan out systems and get people to do them so this is a major part of the entrepreneurial skill set is to be able to write these systems together in a way that's efficient and that everyone's on the same page with them now from my own experience of running an automation Agency on screen I've given you some serious Source because these are the exact things that we had pitfalls on and issues with so if you want to get a real jump start on how to scale smoothly and not run into the same pitfalls that we have then take notes on this and be sure to start setting them up within your business firstly you need to lay out what the onboarding process for new clients looks like in this onboarding process it is key to make sure both the client and your team are on the same page and they have the same vision for what you're going to be creating now this is very very important because sometimes you get to the end of a contract and what you've created is not lined up with what the client wants so I'd say an issue because you've got mismatched expectations and you've delivered something that wasn't what they had in mind you need to build an onboarding process that ensures that your client and your team are on the same page secondly I'd suggest you make some sort of work submission process so that when one of your team members has finished a particular part of a contract then you can all pass it into maybe a group chat within you and your other developers you can say hey can we all approve this can we make sure that this is good to go out because without this you're going to get some of your developers just throwing stuff at the clients stuff that you're not happy with and that you haven't reviewed and that's going to cause a bunch of issues so make sure you have some kind of submission process to evaluate and quality check and do some quality control on the work that you're being passed over to the clients thirdly you need some kind of Handover process to tie off a project make sure you're collecting data so you can do the comparisons and see if you've made any any changes to the metric you were trying to change in the first place and you can do things like testimonials and get referrals and things like that so A system or a process on how you can do the Handover is going to be important in your business as well and finally you need to set clear communicate rules for your team so that they know exactly when they're supposed to be sending updates to clients okay Monday Wednesday Friday you send an update and this is how you structure the update this assists you provide examples of messages you need to send you get them protocols for when you're going to go over if you're going over a deadline okay this is what you need to do let's say communicate it if you run into an issue this is how you communicated and when all of these kind of things need to be spelled out in plain writing for your team to be able to understand if you don't have this setup then you're going to run into so many issues because people have different communication Styles and between the members of your team is going to be different you need a way of standardizing it so it's consistent throughout the company please learn from my mistakes in writing and building my own AI automation agency and start to put these in place as soon as you can once you have team members and once you start scaling up my last tip on how you can get to ten thousand dollars per month and Beyond is how you can fill your pipeline how you can make sure that you always have a ton of lead and a ton of interest in your services so that at any point you need to bring in more money you can just open the door and suddenly you have more clients this is obviously no small feet but this is something you need to be working towards every business owner tip for filling your pipeline is that your initial sales the first couple of clients at your service that money should be going back into filling your pipeline it should be going out for dinner it shouldn't be spent on clothes and cars or whatever you want to buy it needs to be going back into the business in order to set up sustainable long-term methods of getting more leads and more business your real goal here should be setting up some kind of way for your business to start getting inbound leads now inbound there's obviously people reaching out to you outbound is you reaching out to them your business at this current stage is likely fully dependent on outbound you have to communicate to them before they get in touch with you but what you want to start doing in order to scale Beyond sort of 10K and Beyond you should also start looking at how you can start creating an inbound source of leads this is not necessarily a case of one is better than the other both require a lot of effort in different ways you want to be combining inbound without bound to make a sort of hybrid so that your business is able to be sustainable over the long term so where should you be investing your time and money in order to start generating these inbound leads firstly you have things like Facebook groups getting in there and being active finding ones within your Niche and starting to provide value and saying hey we did this this for clients we've found that people within our Niche are able to use this sort of chat bot or this sort of deliverable to get these kind of results and get active and then start building a bit of a reputation and sharing value same thing applies for LinkedIn groups find some LinkedIn groups for your Niche and start to provide some value set the network in there and building up a bit of a reputation for providing value and providing services within that Niche same thing goes for YouTube of course I have a YouTube channel myself and I get basically all of my leads to my YouTube channel so if you do it right you can get all of your business through a YouTube channel but if you're doing a Instagram you can do the same thing you can make some short form content saying we help these kind of businesses do this and then you should start getting a slow trickle at first of inbound leads another thing that you can start to consider now is getting your website set up so figuring out a little bit of brand identity and how you want to position yourself obviously keeping in line with that Niche down aspect where we are an expert in this your website should be very directed and be saying uh we create killer AI chat Bots to onboard social media clients doing this this and this need to keep that messaging streamlined and pointed at your avatar because if you go General and say hey we just automate stuff with AI you're not going to speak to anyone and it's going to be very hard for your people who land on your site to understand what you do and similarly to that my last Point here is that you need to work on creating a case study or something on a landing page you can start to drive traffic to so this may be a case of sitting down in front of a camera like I am here and saying hey this is an example of a client that we worked with we did this this and this and taking them through some sort of presentation similar to what I'm doing here and explaining this is the business we work with this is how we came and helped them this is the results we got and you want to make maybe a 20 30 40 minute long video put it on a landing page you make with click funnels or something with all of your your LinkedIn posts or Facebook groups or your your ads that you run you might even run some search ads or Facebook ads you can start to drive traffic to that page and then people will learn about your service learn about what you do and you can never call to action to book an accord and the final cherry on top that I want to add this video because I know you guys are about to go out and get stuck right into this and take all the notes put them on your wall and start trying to build one of these automation agencies but you need to take a few precautionary steps and how you're going to manage your time so that you don't start running down the wrong path which is what this entire video has been about I only have one point to make when it comes to time management for AAA owners and that is sales sales sales at the end of the day without money coming in and sales being made you don't have a business you can have sales and no website but still have a business but you can't have a website and no sales and have a business the sales are the business this is why I say that 80 or more of your time as an entrepreneur with a startup business like you're starting now should be focused on sales and marketing strictly on how am I getting more customers what am I building to ensure that we get some sort of inbound lead flow or what am i setting up to am i setting up email campaigns am i setting up a new cold calling script am i setting up new lead generation methods 80 percent of your time should be focused on doing that work or even cold calling like actually getting on the phone and saying this is the most high impact thing I could do for my business right now is sit on the phone the whole day and call because if I get two clients out of a whole day that is far more impact to my business than if I build a website and create a little document that is doing nothing for your business really without the sales and without the clients so do not let your brain take the easy route and go to things like oh I'm going to set up an LLC or things like this it doesn't matter if you haven't got sales you haven't got a business pick up the phone and start calling that is likely the highest impact thing you can do for your business because it's going to get money in and then you're going to be able to invest in team and build things up and then you can do an LLC and you can do all that down the road but without sales without money coming in you don't have a business as I say here LLCs logos office space website it doesn't matter without sales I cannot stress this enough it really pains me to see it in my Discord Community people saying oh I've done this and this and this like I've had a win that I did this like wait it doesn't even matter if you don't have sales if you haven't landed a client if you haven't brought in any money to your business over the past month you haven't done anything right you haven't done the Right Moves you haven't been focusing on doing the right tasks which is the biggest task for an entrepreneur is to be able to prioritize things correctly prioritizing your time on the tasks that are going to provide the biggest impact to your business and for you starting out that is going to be sales one handy trick that you can do and I really urge you to do this is whenever you write down what you're going to do say in your Morning Journal you write down your plan for the day ask yourself how much of this is actually helping to drive sales of the business how many of these tasks are directly correlated to potentially increasing our cash flow inbound how many of these tasks or what percentage of them are directly linked to Bringing more money into the business and if you look at it and you've got website design logo design all of that stuff it's not really related to bringing in business you need to cross them off and re-prioritize in order to make sure you're spending time on bringing business to your business and with that out of the way you are now clear to put your pin down to close your notebook but I do have one more thing that may be very interesting to you if you're one of the few people who are left here now which is the giveaway that I'm running for this video at the moment as I mentioned at the beginning of the video I have just launched my free incubator program

              "text": "if you have clicked on this video chances are you are hungry and aspiring entrepreneur who's been obsessed with AI for the past three to six months and maybe that's because you're smart enough to know a life-changing opportunity when you see one you've been searching desperately for a way to make money and build businesses with AI but all you've found a gimmicky and unsustainable loopholes pushed by people who have never made a dime with any of them if this describes you then what I'm about to explain to you will change your life just as it's changed mine today I'm going to be sharing with you the AI business model that I discovered scaled and now teach to thousands of people within my community some of which are making thousands of dollars a month all without knowing how to code but first a little bit about me and what I do my name is Liam oppley and I have my own AI development and AI automation company called Morningside AI that currently does around 100 000 Revenue per month I was born and raised in New Zealand but now I'm based in Dubai and currently I'm enjoying the European summer in Belgium I started my entrepreneurial Journey out of a crusty flat in Edinburgh during my Gap year with no money no skills but Big Dreams I'm I've been doing online business for the past five years living all across the world but for the past year my focus has been specifically on AI like you I recognize the huge potential of AI technology but struggled to figure out where the average entrepreneur like you and I could build a profitable and more importantly long lasting business fortunately enough through my own trial and error in building my own AI company I eventually discovered what I've named the AI automation agency or AAA model in this video I'm going to be explaining why starting an AI automation agency is by far the biggest and most beginner friendly opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to transition from AI Spectators as 99 of you are right now to an active participant in the AI Arena building real businesses making real money and building real skills what I'm not going to do is sit here and sell you a get rich quick scheme creating an online business that grants you complete financial and location Freedom takes time effort and sacrifice and there is no way around that all you can really try to do to make it easier is to select the right business mortal at the right time when competition is low and emotions are high the AI automation agency model that I've created takes both of these boxes which is why I'm so hell-bent on sharing my learnings and trying to build the biggest community of AAA owners in the world do not go anywhere do not click off this tab I promise you that the information that I'm about to share will be worth your time and it might just change your life so first things first why is the AI automation agency model the next big thing in online business and why is it the best on-ramp for entrepreneurs looking to get into AI to start building businesses and making money as you have clearly already figured out AI is the next World changing technology of our lifetimes it joins a long line of revolutionary Technologies from the wheel to steam power to electricity that have completely changed the lives of those who witnessed their wrath and Creation in our lifetime we've witnessed two of these things firstly the creation of the World Wide Web journey.com boom in the late 90s and early 2000s and secondly the smartphone revolution of the 2010s both of these technologies have fundamentally changed the way we live our lives right now we we are in the early stages of the AI Revolution which has the potential to cause a complete transformation of the way our world functions and you know what as soon as you're outside of that hype bubble these patterns are not even that hard to analyze better yet I've already done it for you the best way for the aspiring entrepreneur with little to no skills or money to make money with AI or any emerging technology is to facilitate the adoption of it and help businesses to apply that technology still confused stick with me when the World Wide Web took off Smart entrepreneurs built web development companies to help businesses build in online prisons when smartphones took off Smart entrepreneurs built app development companies to help businesses build their own apps when social media took off Smart entrepreneurs built social media marketing companies to help businesses to build the social media presence and drive sales from it and so 10 years from now what are people going to be saying when artificial intelligence took off Smart entrepreneurs built AI automation agencies to help businesses integrate AI technology do you see the pattern so I know what you're thinking what in the hell does an AI automation agency actually do to simplify it down an AI automation agency as a type of business that focuses on integrating AI technology into businesses this can take many forms depending on the structure of your AAA and the kind of Niche you're working in but services are typically aimed at automating processes boosting productivity and ultimately increasing profits Service delivery itself can actually be done with no code or low code tools like zapier for automations or bot press and stack AI for AI chatbots meaning that even people without a development background can start an AI automation agency we have people inside my community who have never ridden a line of code selling chat Bots that either they've made or they've taken templates that I've given away within the community and they're selling these for upwards of a thousand dollars a piece so how did I discover the AI automation agency or Triple A model how did I answer the question that we've all been asking of how can I build a sustainable and profitable business with AI well for a long time my company Morningside AI was strictly an AI development company building custom coded applications for our clients thanks to my channel we've been fortunate enough to have some of the best talent in the world on our development team but the best comes at a price and since originally we were custom coding every project we were doing this price was often too much for the small businesses that were coming us needing basic AI applications to integrate into their businesses it got to the point where we were eventually ignoring any leads that came in the door that were under five thousand dollars because we knew realistically they didn't have the money for the solution that we could provide them with and as a business owner of a young company it is pretty painful to hear that over the past week you've ignored 20 plus leads because you didn't have an offer for them and so to try and capture some of this Revenue I set out to find a solution the solution came primarily in the form of low code and no code bot Builders like bot press and stack AI which are now industry standard for anyone running an AI automation agency these bot Builders slashed the hours required for basic services that many of these small smaller businesses wanted like customized chat Bots but these bot building platforms had another effect of allowing us to essentially assign anyone who knew how to use these platforms to deliver the service for the client meaning our expensive AI developers could stay working on the important tasks of the AI development when we first tested this new lower tier offer to our backlog of clients that we'd been ignoring we were immediately swamped with requests so at that point we knew we were onto something big since I first shared this model with the world I've been posting my results and my learnings here on YouTube and I've started a movement far bigger than myself and thus the AI automation agency or AAA model came out of a need for more affordable development services for the smaller businesses who are reaching out to us in droves the solution and what makes this business model so beginner friendly for entrepreneurs is this Service delivery with low code or no code tools meaning that anyone can start an AI automation agency even without a background in development now I couldn't make this video without covering the one question you have left which is how can I start my own because I only created this model over the past few months right now competition for selling AI Automation Services is basically zero if you are watching this right now you have a huge early mover advantage that shrinks by the day where we are right now with AI automation agencies in 2023 is equivalent to smma in 2017. it is completely untapped many of those who got into smma early made millions of dollars 99 of those who start today will never make a dime why saturation today business owners are bombarded with offers for marketing services from all angles and for the past few years it has been a race to the bottom on price for even the veterans of the industry what makes the AI automation agency model so lucrative and so beginner friendly right now is that businesses have never been offered these Services before it is a completely fresh offer these businesses have no clue what AI can do for their business or how they can integrate it but there's nothing that sounds sexier to a business owner than hey I have a robot who can do things faster for longer and to wear higher standard than your current employees almost every day it seems in my community Unity there's people posting these responses from clients that they're doing cold Outreach too and it's always in the same idea of wow that sounds amazing or well yeah I'd love to try that and it makes you think when was the last time someone got that kind of response when they were offering social media marketing Services what I'm trying to say is that it will never be easier than it is right now as a beginner to start making money with this model right now someone with zero sales experience can call DM a business and end up closing that sale because this offer is so untapped right now and just to be clear I've literally seen the stuff happen and get posted in the winds channel of our community so with that urgency in mind and yes I know you hear this kind of stuff all the time if people trying to sell you stuff I don't have anything to sell you I just really really want you guys to take advantage of this opportunity while it's so fresh and while it's so easy for beginners because I know how difficult it can be as a beginner trying to start a business and running into these these headwinds essentially of this offer's already been used and it's saturated so if you want to get started with building your own AI automation agency here's what I would suggest firstly and this is an absolute must I can't stress this enough if you don't do this you're literally playing on hard mode for no reason and that's to join my Discord once inside you get instant access to free trainings free chatbot templates that I've created that you can literally steal and start selling for yourself and more importantly thousands of people who are ready to help you and are doing the same thing we are the only community that is solely focused on building and scaling AI automation agencies and I've made everything 100 free and accessible for you guys as soon as you get in there secondly I've signed up to bot press and stack Ai and get familiar with them at least these are the two main softwares that I use to deliver chatbots for clients so this is going to be the best starting point for you in terms of getting familiar with how to deliver and how these things work together and how you could potentially start to sell them and what sort of flexibilities and offers you could sell with these kind of chat bots made on these platforms now I never promote anything that I don't use myself religiously but these two are the only softwares that I partnered with so if you want to support me and support the channel you can find an affiliate Link in the description to get access to this platform and sign up thirdly I'd suggest that you subscribe to my AI automation agency newsletter called over the shoulder in which I grant you weekly access to my personal notebook that's typically include my learnings from

available in the description in the pin comment in a playlist so you can click that playlist and get straight into watching all of the videos that I put out on this exact topic now I know it seems a bit Richard me to make you watch this whole video and then get to the end and then just point you to more of my own resources but the truth is I've only been talking about this for the past few months and there really isn't anyone else talking about it right now this should be people soon coming out of the community who are also making videos on YouTube and covering areas that maybe I don't have expertise in a specific niche in other areas so I would love nothing more than having more hands on deck to spread this message and so to you the hungry aspiring AI entrepreneur your search is over I have just presented to you a business model with zero startup costs a beginner friendly learning curve a completely untapped Market plus the resources you need to get started my hope is that you take

softwares that you can use to get this set up within your own AI automation agency which means that by the end of the video you're going to be armed with five excellent opportunities to take and start building your own AI automation offer and business with now if you're listening to this and going what in the hell is an AI automation agency then you're going to want to head back and watch my previous video which will be available up here in which I go through exactly what an AI automation agency is how I discovered it and how I've come across this business Model A high level look at the kind of services and value you provide to businesses but more importantly I explain in black and white detail why this AI automation agency opportunity is so big and why it's important that you get started now so that you don't miss the boat so if you're new to the space be sure to click up here watch that video and then come back and you'll be ready to get started now if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley I have my own AI development and AI automation company called Morningside AI we help businesses both large and small to build custom coded AI applications but we also partner with businesses as an automations partner doing a top to bottom analysis of the business and how exactly we can apply AI Technologies to reduce expenses and at the end of the day increase profits I'm from New Zealand but I'm now based in Dubai and at the moment I'm in beautiful Antwerp and Belgium I've been an online entrepreneur coming up for five years now and I actually discovered the AI automation agency model that I'm going to be explaining in this video over the past couple of months now for those of you who are interested in the kind of results you can see by running an AI automation Agency on screen you can see that my results were forty five thousand dollars profit in the month of May I did an entire breakdown on of that month which is available up here and my agency and development company is currently doing around a hundred thousand dollars in Revenue per month with a near-term goal of a hundred thousand dollars in profit per month now before we get started with the five services that I'm going to take you through for one of the services that I'm going to mention in this video you can actually get my exact chatbot template and steal it and copy it and put it on your own bot press account and start selling it if you want to get more information on how you can get this chatbot template I'm going to be covering it at the end of the video hey guys to do a deep dive on one of them doing a full breakdown exactly how you deliver it and do the full video on it so if you guys want to see one of these in a future video where I actually deliver it and I show you these systems that you can set up be sure to let me know in the comments below each comment that you put down will enter you into the draw to win a 20-minute Consulting call with me whichever service has the most comments on it I'll be doing a video on that within the next week and I'll also be selecting the winner of the Consulting call within seven days so if you want to win that Consulting call and want to let me know what you want to see then comment down below service number one is a personalized cold Outreach system now the idea behind this personalized cold Outreach system is to be able to help businesses to convert more leads into paying customers what you're going to be doing is creating an AI enabled API flow which takes information on a prospect or a lead and you're going to use that as context to help generate a personalized message and ideally if you do it right that message is going to have a high response rate than a generic one now why is it such a good service to sell well firstly the response rates on cold Outreach already suck for most businesses and businesses are already paying good money to actually acquire these leads in the first place so that they're spending money to get these high quality leads your job is then to help them squeeze as much money as possible out of those leads by increasing the response rate and conversion from leads to paying customers or at least from a cold lead to a warm lead where they've booked an appointment Etc this increase in conversion from cold leads to warm leads is going to be facilitated through your personalized messaging system this is because people are already bombarded with hundreds and hundreds of generic emails and by making a personalized email to the person depending on the information on your LinkedIn profile or other source you're able to create a message that sounds personalized and speaks directly to them and cuts through the Clutter so how can you actually deliver this service it can actually all be done within zapier so you can start off with a lead sheet that's going to have all the leads arriving on it and it needs to include a link to the person's LinkedIn then you need to set up your zap so that it's going to pull information from a row and that lead sheet it's going to take the LinkedIn URL and it's going to scrape the information from the profile now there's a bunch of different methods that you can use to scrape information within zapier you can use things like Phantom Buster as well they have his API integration that allows you to get information from LinkedIn and then the key part here is that you're going to pass all of that data that you just got off LinkedIn into a prompted chat GPT window and within that prompt you can write things like you are an expert cold Outreach message writer your goal is to take information which will be provided from their LinkedIn and write a personalized message here's some examples of previous messages that we like and it's going to take the information in from the LinkedIn scrape it's going to inject it into that prompt and then it's going to give you the outputted message and then finally the last piece in this app is to take get information connect to the email delivery platform and then send off an email to the lead now onto service number two which is a staff training chat bot now the idea behind this deliverable is that companies often need to train new staff and by providing a chat bot that has all of the training materials inside it you can eliminate a lot of the manual work and sort of back and forth between managers and new new hires and things like that and streamline the process of hiring and not only are you allowing them to have instant access and on-demand access as a new hire to all of this information you're giving the manager peace of mind and you're giving them their time back essentially so of course training new staff as a business especially if you have high staff turnover can suck it's very painful for managers it's awkward for the new hires who can sometimes feel a little bit awkward about asking questions the idea with this chatbot and the value that you're selling is that you're going to reduce the amount hours required to onboard new hires and then Industries where their turnover is very high this can be extremely valuable by taking all of the businesses training documents and frequently asked questions and putting it into a customized chat bot you can have a 24 7 helper available to these new hires to answer their questions so how can you deliver the service the First Step would be to request training documents or frequently asked questions documents from the business owner then you can ingest those documents into a custom knowledge base within bot press or stack Ai and then you can deploy that chatbot to Whatsapp or telegram or even to a web URL for people to access within their business service number three is a customized plan generator now the idea behind the service is to create a Content generation system that's going to leverage a previous batch of documents that are made by a specific client and use those old documents to generate new ones and safety my time of time as you can see on screen here there are some industries that rely very heavily on these kind of customized plans of course you have nutrition for dieting you have Fitness for workout plans you have personal finance for finance tracking and methods of investing Etc by Nature creating these personalized and customized plans can take a lot of time for these business owners and so if you're able to sell them a service where we can say hey look all those hundreds of ones that you've already done all those hundreds of plans that you've already made for previous clients we can take those and repurpose them and use them to create new ones in seconds for you now if they don't already have any kind of system set up to to do this already this is going to be a huge Time Saver and a huge value add for that business so how can you actually deliver one of these first step is to collect a bunch of examples from your client for example if you're working with a nutritionist you could ask for a hundred examples of previous meal plans that they've created once you have all the documents you can put it into a stack AI Vector database and have it there for later recall then you'll need to do some prompting in order to get it to generate plans using the examples pulled from the Victor database once you've set that up you can deploy it to a chat bot either on stack AI or on bot press and then allow the client of yours to come on and enter some information say I might I need a meal plan for a 40 year old woman who wants to lose 10 pounds and she's vegan then it's going to search the vector database for any plans that match that are similar to that pull it into your prompt template and say here are some examples and here's what the lady wants please generate the outcome and then you're going to get that meal plan provided for your client within the chat bot service number four is an onboarding chat assistant the concept behind this onboarding chat assistant is that onboarding processes within businesses can be clunky they can be drawn out they can be extremely inefficient and if humans are getting involved and if every step of the way there's a lot of wastage and a lot of potentially lost Revenue when clients drop off during that onboarding process your job when delivering the services to take an entire onboarding process from a business and simplify it down to a chat bot where a client can be sent a link to the chat bot they can go oh okay my name is this this is what's your point of content okay this is the point of contact okay here's where can I see in the contract okay I'm generating the contract now and I'm going to send it the main AI aspect of this and what makes it so powerful for businesses is that you can integrate a AI powered contract generator within this chat bot using the exact same method that I just mentioned about generating meal plans you can also use it to generate contracts for your clients and integrate that into this onboarding chatter system now the good news is if you're going to be selling something like this basically every service business on the planet needs to onboard clients at some point so all you need to do is Niche down to one specific industry say social media marketing agencies or something like that you can say hey I can simplify your entire onboarding process down to a 15-step chatbot interaction with a client this is how much it's going to cost and this is where it's going to be deployed this can be extremely beneficial for both the person who was being on board and the company that is doing the onboarding and business owners are able to simplify much of the admin that typically goes into connecting people to slack or contracts or invoicing and things like that and just put it all into one place that can run autonomously so how would you actually deliver this well first off you would hop on a workshop call with your client and say give me the full breakdown of your current onboarding system where are people signing contracts where are people being invoiced from which communication channels are people being added to what things are happening in the background let's get all of that condensed down to a clear plan of what your onboarding system looks like currently and then you can take that away and as I say in step two here convert that onboarding process into a chatbot so you can map it out in figma or something like that or you can just map it out directly in a platform like bot press start to connect all the required components like information capture invoicing sending the contract generating the contract adding to slack channels creating new Trello boards Etc all can be done in the background via this chat bot and the best thing is if you use a platform like bot press you're able to easily deploy this onto their website so that customers can go on and get access to and finally service number five is a Airbnb guest support chat bot this week I actually did an hour-long workshop on this exact idea within my Discord if you want to get access to that Workshop we talked through how to position yourself and how to identify avatars how to craft your offer and how you can actually deliver the spot that's going to be available in the description and it's also going to be available to download the exact Airbnb support chat by template that I've created so that you can just copy and paste exactly what I've created and start offering this as a service to Airbnb hosts access to that workshop and the bot template is going to be available in the first link in the description so what's the concept behind this particular deliverable people who have multiple properties on Airbnb and they're self-managing can get really bogged down by the amount of communication that's required to handle new guests and have check in and check out and where's the Wi-Fi password and this this is so many questions that they can get bombarded with the point of this deliverable is to create an AI chatbot that can eliminate 80 to 90 of all the regular queries that come in we can do this by taking the frequently asked questions for a specific property putting it into a custom mileage base of a chat bot then make that available to the customers via WhatsApp or Telegram and it's actually a twofold benefit for this kind of deliverable because not only can you sell it as being beneficial for the host like you can get peace of mind of not having to be available at all hours you can have complete peace of mind that check-in is going to go smoothly all the information is there but more importantly the clients actually have a beta while the guests actually have a better experience on the property if they have that 24 7 service and and customer support so it's a very very attractive offer because you're not only benefiting the homeowner but you're also benefiting the guests and potentially increasing the guest satisfaction ratings reviews Etc so how would you actually deliver this as I said you get the sport and FAQ documents from the owner for a specific property then you can ingest that into a custom knowledge base with bot press or stack Ai and you can easily deploy that bot to Whatsapp or telegram so that the Airbnb owner can take that telegram handle or that WhatsApp number and provide it to them and say for all support queries contact this in an emergency contact this and as I've just mentioned on screen here you can see that I'm giving away the exact Airbnb chat bot template that I just mentioned I've already built it out I've made a template out of it so you're going to be able to download it people have already got access to it in the Discord but you can get access to it in the first link in the description that's going to take you to access the workshop so you can see me go through this entire opportunity and analyze it and then get access to the exact same bot that I built in that so that you can take it and start pitching it to other people on Airbnb and start selling it now with any of these services and deliverables sound exciting to you and you want to get started with your own AI automation agency but don't yet have experience with bot prison stack AI I've actually just released a 30 to 40 minute long video of me

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be building one of my own AI automation agency clients chat Bots that was worth three thousand five hundred dollars live for you guys watching over my shoulder every step of the way this video is going to be hugely valuable to anyone who is new to the AI automation space and wants to very quickly wrap their head around bot press and stack AI how they work together how to build chat Bots and Bot Preston you're going to see the end result which I was able to sell for eventually three thousand five hundred dollars and how you guys can take the exact same Blue Plate and template and start to sell it to your own clients onwards of course if you're new to the channel my name is Liam otley I have my own AI development and AI automation company called Morningside AI we help businesses both large and small to build custom coded AI applications and entirely new AI products but we also work with businesses as automation Partners we'll be doing head to toe analysis of every part of the business and how we can apply AI to reduce friction to decrease expenses and at the end of the day increase profits and for the current month of June Morningside is on track to smash our goal of one hundred thousand dollars in Revenue just to give you an idea you have the kind of numbers that we're doing with this business model and for our custom coded application side of things as well and for my regular views you may notice that um again in a different location I'm actually in Amsterdam in the Netherlands with my business partner for a few days we've got some meetings here before heading out uh later this week now before we get into actually building the bot you're probably going to want to know what this thing does and sort of a bit of context around us so to keep it brief this was a client that worked with us at Morningside he has a SAS platform that works with martial arts businesses to handle their leads and handle their systems and products and things like that and what this bot that we were creating was meant to do was be placed on all of the different sites of the SAS customers so that he could have some kind of AI chat bot element that's going to take caption information from the users since you figure out what they're looking to find on the site help direct them to the kind of products and services and booking Pages the point of this chatbot was to be able to be easily copied and pasted over all of the different clients that he has with the SAS business and the main functionality is to collect information from the potential customers who visit the site and guide them along a personalized conversation so that they're able to find the correct products and services and get pushed to the conversion event which in this case is a booking a booking page to book a class we also built in a lead capture aspect so for more the information that we're asking along the way figuring out the intent of the user why you're speaking to the business what you'd be interested in then we can capture all of that information with their lead the email and name and then essentially enrich that lead with the data we've collected in the earlier part of the chatbot once we capture this information we're using zapier to send it directly to a Google sheet now I can actually show you what the finished product is going to look like down here so I've just put this onto a test website here is the embeddable little bubble down the corner which we can easily put onto client sites we can click that and it's going to pop up with the bot hi I'm Joseph your AI martial arts assistant from Superstar martial arts what brought you here today so let me get through these nice buttons which are built into the UI you don't have to mess around with it too much martial arts for myself and since it's going to guide us along a conversation click some important information and then try to push us through the booking pages so that's great a martial arts program was designed specifically for adults so it's making me feel like this is a what I'm looking for essentially okay I want to learn self-defense do you have a martial art in mind let's do MMA great choice MMA combines different martial arts which are great for self-defense so it feels like it's personalized and feels like it's it's making me think that the product that they're going to sell me is ideal for what I'm looking for which is self-defense and I'm an adult would you like more information on how to get started sure tell me more best way to try our program is to see what's right for you and then we can book a trial here by clicking this link and that will send the potential customer straight to the booking page do you have any questions regarding getting started now here's the lead capture if I say email me the info so we have a info pack essentially you can send out so now I can provide my email and my full name and now what's happened in the back end here is that we've taken all of that information we've taken the answers that I said which I'm an adult I'm looking for self-defense classes that are MMA focused taking all of that information attached it to my email and name and then they have that in the Google sheet to start their email marketing too now you may be thinking this doesn't sound very AI enabled but you'd be wrong this last bit here is really the key AI functionality which is a open loop of being able to ask questions to a knowledge base so do you have any further questions yes what we have is a knowledge base that's been ingested and put into stack AI but also into bot press as well what would you like to know I can ask questions in the large space which is what um Marshall art do you offer now it's going to query the knowledge base do you have any further questions yes can my eight-year-old start classes yes children as young as four can start classes and the program is great for kids age four to fourteen do you have any further questions now this is an open loop we're essentially able to ask questions to this knowledge base until we have all levels of information that we want and the final thing I want to mention before we get stuck in is what tech stack we're using so essentially we're using bot press as the base of this application to handle the logic and to handle the general sort of deployment and and UI of the bot as well using the custom code blocks within bot press we're actually able to make API calls to our stack AI functionality which is super easy to create I'm going to be showing you that in this video as well so we're going to build the bot press application from scratch and we're also going to build elements in stack Ai and I'm going to show you how to connect the two so you can essentially have all of the amazing functionality of Stack Ai and sort of land chain visualized and how you can connect that into your Bot press using very very simple API calls that any beginner can understand now I will say there are so many different applications and platforms that are coming out to solve this problem of building chat Bots and having complex AI functionality that this is subject to change and there's sort of new new technology that I'm finding out about basically every day with another code hey guys just jumping and recording this a few days later bot press has actually just released their important export feature meaning that I can actually share the bot that I build in this video with you guys so if you watch it all you'll be able to see how to build it you'll learn how to use Bob press and stack Ai and how they work together then at the end of the video I'm going to explain how you guys can get this exact same bot template download it import it into your own botbras account and start to use it and sell it to your own clients and have fun with it so it's going to be available at the end of the video sort of just jump in and let you guys know that now so here we are inside bot press what you want to do is sign up to an account in the description there's a link there it's an affiliate link so you will be helping me in the channel out if you click on that once you're logged in you're going to want to click on create a chat bot uh it's not actually allowing me to do it right now so I've just cleared one of my older projects and then you're going to edit it it's going to give you a few different options as to the kind of templates they offer but for now just start on completely from scratch so you can follow along step by step and once you get inside you should be looking at something similar to this now I will show you the example of what we're building this is sort of the end product that we're going to be working towards so we have two different trees here essentially this takes a a bunch of information from the user and then we have a sort of custom merge based query here's our stack AI integration using a custom code block so a lot of work here but we are going to be able to get through it within the scope of this video you guys are going to be able to have this as a template that you can then use for your additional clients or for whatever purposes you want you can modify it whatever you want if you go along step by step with me here now this is going to be the perfect video for many of you beginners because we're going to cover a lot of stuff in a short space of time all of the different elements that you're going to use most commonly how to handle routing how to handle custom code blocks how to set up API calls to stack AI how to push leads to a sheet using zapier we have a zapier API call in here as well so a ton of value a ton of good golden nuggets in here for you guys to be able to take the exact same code and put it into your own applications so we can get started let's start by placing our first node here you can drag out and drop standard node for the sake of speed here so we can rename this node up here by clicking on this we can call this hello what we're going to do is add in our first text I'm going to be going through this fairly quickly so at any point if you need to pause the video just to copy down what I'm writing then feel free to do that but I do need to keep the pace up or this is going to be an hour long second text Block in here paste that in and now we need to get an information capture which is a single Choice here so this is going to allow us to capture some information from the user in the form of a button click so here we have it as a single choice and we need to ask users so when it's asking for the information you need to ask the question which for this case is going to be what brought you here today and we need to create some options for the users to select so we can click here to this little plus icon we can say Marshall art for myself then we can hit enter martial arts for my child and then we need to create a variable so we're actually tracking and saving what they reply to this so we can add a new one and call this uh who for and now when they click one of those buttons it's going to save it to the variable that we can use that information later on for creating personalized messages or for adding to the lead form when they submit their information now down here you can actually test your chatbot what we can do is start the conversation by saying hi and here you can see how each of the elements actually displays so we have the first message the second message and then this Yellow Block here which is I'm going to ask the question and it's capturing for the who4 variable then I'm able to select what I want so martial arts for myself okay we can go on to the next node so I'm going to call this one why you here add a new text block paste it in here feel free to take a read then we need another single Choice with the question of why are you looking to learn martial arts so this is asking for a little more intent from the user and the first option we're going to provide users with is I want to stay fit and the second one is going to be I want to learn self defense now for this particular node we don't actually need these to have separate routes essentially so we can click these two little buttons here and that means that it's not going to sort of split them based on the answer we're just going to continue on regardless so we can add a transition here just using the expression now you do have this AI aspect up here so you can type things in like no knowledge like no answer from knowledge and it's going to try to generate the code but I find a lot of the time it doesn't work too well so take that out of here in this case we're just not going to need to write true here that'll wrap your head around how these transitions work essentially we have this condition here and if whatever's in this comes out as true then it's going to send the user to the next node so if we can just hard code in true it'll pop up as always so that means it's always going to be true you're always going to send users so they send this message they take the user input and if it gets the next block it's always going to send to the next one and there's one thing we forgot to do on our capture information here which is to create a new variable which is going to be why lessons and enter to create that now on this new node we can change it to which Marshall art and click here we can add a new code block so this is the first time we're using a custom code block by bot press a quick breakdown on how these things work essentially you're able to access the variables that you've been sitting within bot press which if you click on the background here you can see we have two variables of who4 and Y lessons now Within These code blocks you're able to access those variables by typing workflow dot then the variable name so here you can see if the Y lessons variable which is this node here was set to I want to learn self defense then we're going to go workflow dot next message so the next message variable which we can create right now add a new variable and call this next message a description the next message for the bot to send add that and we're going to set the value of that next message variable to whatever we want so in this case it's going to be a message that's related to or a sort of complementary to the user's previous input that they provided of I want to learn self-defense so this is how you can essentially take what variables were captured previously do some logic with it using an if else block cross which case statement and then as you'll see we can use this variable in the next node now if you don't have any experience coding don't freak out because all of this stuff is super super basic JavaScript and you're going to be able to ask chat GPT to generate all of this I mean you're going to be able to use this example here as just some basic stuff but chat gbt is able to generate basically all of this no matter how complex we get so you're going to see that later as well next card we need to add here is going to be another text block so and we're going to make this our next message variable so this is the magic here that you can actually get it to print out or the bot to send a variable value so by us setting the value of the message here so we go workflow dot next message we can set it and then send it straight afterwards this is just the first step towards making more and more advanced applications with boardpress so now we can grab another single Choice have another single Choice here and the question we want to ask is going to be do you have a martial art in mind we're going to add a few different items here kick boxing MMA and karate now we can again turn off these different little routing options and we want to create a new variable here as always this is going to be type of martial uh just to give you a quick look at how this is coming out already I can say hi okay now we have some buttons martial arts myself great it's going to send the message it's going to ask for the next bit which is here why are you looking to learn martial arts I want to learn self-defense okay and now it's going to send the personalized message which is knowing you can look after yourself is more important than ever these days so it's taken the input that I provided and it's giving me a customized message based off what that value was and then setting the next message variable so we're doing uh sort of less nodes but we're using the custom code blocks we set variables essentially and by doing that we save a huge sprawl of different nodes all over the place we can simplify it down by using those custom code blocks do you have a martial art in mind I think we're going to go with kickboxing great and now we're up to where we are here so we can add a transition another expression again we're going to set this turn off the AI and set this as true so it's just always going to transition up to this next one we're going to start off with a large conditional block here so what you can do is add in a execute code block now this looks quite complicated but it's essentially the same thing as we've done before it's just on a bigger scale so this using a switch case statement the way these are generated you can do it very very easily so all you need to do is provide chat GPT with a breakdown of of what the structure of your of your chatbot is so say I have I have variable of who for and these are the options and I have variable of Y lessons and these are the options and I have variable of type martial art and these lessons then it's going to be able to end the math do essentially all of those different combinations and you can say can you give me a switch case statement or a FL statement that's going to be able to give personalized answers for all of these different combinations of variables that they might have picked up now so the whole point of this execute code block is to save again a ton of different nodes that are required we can simplify this down and use the same process of going at next message so depending on what the user's input has been up to that point we're going to essentially set the next message to a customized message so if they were selecting four martial arts for themselves which is the first question and then they also said I want to stay fit which is the second message and then they said I want to do kickboxing then we can sort of combine all those inputs and write a personalized method which is great choice kickboxing is an excellent martial arts for Fitness we offer classes every Wednesday where that experienced coach Mike so this is making it feel like everything that they've said previously is leading them towards the sale and what they're asking for and the products that we have it's a perfect match what they're trying to do then we set the next message to this message and then we send it directly afterwards so so if I restart the conversation and I start again hi martial arts myself I want to learn self-defense I want to do karate excellent decision karate is one of the best martial arts for self-defense join coach join every Friday to learn these techniques so this is the personalized message that's coming out of this big switch case block next step is to take some more user information so we're going to add a single Choice block here the question is going to be would you like more information on how to get started the options we're going to have is sure tell me more I have a question so we're going to take short tell me more down here new node down here new node and we're going to change this one to link to trial this one down here update it to check knowledge now for the link to try out the first text that we're going to add on is just a text card here so this message is going to be sent after they've said uh yes I would like some more information so you can click on this that's the message there great the best way to try our program to see if it's right for you is to take advantage of our special offer so here's an offer that I've just hard-coded in I've just written it in but you can actually put variables in there that the client's able to easily change out depending on the bot so if this is duplicated for multiple different clients websites then they're able to easily change that variable and without having to get in manually and change all of them at once then we need to add in our information capture again asking them a question the question this time is do you have any questions regarding getting started so the options we're going to have here is yes no and then email me the info so three options here Shuffle this down then what we can do is connect the yes route down to this check knowledge node down below we can take the no to the end so essentially they've said do you have any questions regarding getting started and then they've said no we can wrap that to the end because they've said no they don't have any questions questions and then finally we can take the email me the info and just plop a note up here for later now we get on to the more exciting parts of this app which is the knowledge query function which is the AI aspect of this chatbot what we're going to set up is not only a bot press knowledge query but also a stack AI knowledge query so this is a system that I've created and I find works best and this is what I get our developers at Morningside to do as well essentially you use the bot press knowledge query which they have built in which we're going to do in a sec as the sort of initial knowledge query so it's going to ask a question to pop press so hey can you give me a quick answer and if what press comes back with no I don't have an answer which is quite common then it's going to send an API call to one of our stack AI applications and then run a knowledge query using gpt4 or 3.5 turbo and then send us back an answer and in most cases if botbras isn't able to answer stack AI will be able to answer it because it's just using a better model and as a better sort of embedding system and and Vector database setup so the reason we have them layered like that is because bot press responses can be quick and snappy for the very basic things but if it's a bit more of a a curveball question we can pass it to stack aisle form back and if stack AI isn't even able to respond to it then we have another fallback so it's sort of a three-step fallback system for custom Modge queries and then finally we'd say I don't know if that's if we still don't get an answer from either of those first step is to set up our bot press knowledge querying so what we can do is actually create our own knowledge base within bolt press so you can come up to the left corner here and click add knowledge base what I'm going to do is add a knowledge base Source we're going to add a document so what I can do is get the frequently asked questions file or the the support document file from the client in this case I can upload it here as a text file now in your case you're not going to have this I can't give you this data unfortunately but when you go and use this template for another client you can get their q a information or their FAQs in a text file which is just structured question answer question answer then upload it here and you'll be in the same spot as us right now you can write a little description okay so just a little blurb there that you can add in we can also rename this to be knowledge base let's make this super it's the it's knowledge base so it's literally as easy as that to set up a knowledge base with bot press then we need to come over to this agent section which is a new feature and make sure that the knowledge agent is on enabled and this answer on start load is off so make sure that's all set up then we can go back to our main zoom in on this check knowledge node and click this button here which is going to enable knowledge answering now this now this knowledge based querying within bot press can actually be pretty confusing at times but just know that when the query comes in and hits this if this is checked it's going to attempt to query the knowledge with that information that's just arrived so first step for us is going to be taking a single Choice here so we're going to set the question that we asked them when they arrive on this knowledge query node as what would you like to know and we need to change this from a single Choice which is going to be a button into raw input so whenever you want to receive input from the user in the form of a message or just a sort of freeform response you change it to Raw input and it's going to just capture that text as the value so we want to change it to a raw input and we want to catch this value as a new variable called question then we need to set up some important routing depending on if the knowledge base within Bob press was able to give response so we can add another expression here a transition you're going to need to set your transition information to exactly as I have on screen here which is a label of no answer from knowledge so you can easily see that this transition why it's going to be triggered and then the condition is going to be if the knowledge agent which is the agent up here if it has responded so that's going to determine if it hasn't responded then we're going to take them down here so that's what the little exclamation mark means here so if we have not received the response from the knowledge agent essentially it's tried to query it but it's come back as I don't know or I don't have an answer for this question then we need to add another transition here which is going to be always true whenever you transition into the top of your block here it's going to start at the top it's going to read from the top down and here we can see if there's no answer from the knowledge base AKA we're going to ask a question the knowledge base doesn't have response it's going to take it down here but if this condition here doesn't evaluate to true then it's going to go on to the next box so we have the setup here so we receive a question and it's going to ask the bot press knowledgebot so the way this Czech knowledge node is working is we're asking the user a question of what would you like to know and then we're going to query the bot press knowledge base and if there's no answer from the knowledge agent then we're going to route down to this next one which is going to be our stack AI query we have that condition as true and it's going to be always and then we can create a new node just down here this is going to be further cues this is going to be stack AI query sorry to interrupt guys but if you are enjoying the video can you please hit down below and leave a like if there's any value that you're getting out of this it would mean the world to meet and help me reach more people like you and help them build businesses like this back to the video for the further cues we're going to add a single choice on here do you have any further questions and the options here are going to be yes and no and if they have further questions then we can just send them back up to the knowledge query so this is when we start that infinite Loop of them being able to ask question after question and then if they say no we're going to take them to the end now we can give our bot press knowledge base a test what I'm going to do here on the stack AI queries add no answer from WordPress knowledge page so we know that if it's heading down to the stack AR query then this a statement is evaluating to true so we're not getting a response from a bob press knowledge base if you want to test our knowledge query we can just whip through this and we can say hi martial arts myself I want to stay fit kickboxing I have a question what would you like to know now we get to ask a question to the knowledge base and I'm going to say how old do my kids need to be I'm actually going to add a transition onto the bottom here just for now so that we can easily test this change this to True how old do do my kids need to be to start lessons so this is within the knowledge base let's see if we can figure it out kids can start martial arts classes from the age of four great that's a correct answer what martial arts do you offer oh I'm supposed to click a button there actually what I can copy and paste this in what martial arts do you offer so it's doing a pretty good job of answering using the bot press knowledge base I'm going to say I have further questions now if I say something like what color is the sky this so this transition here has worked correctly the knowledge agent didn't respond and it sent us down to the stack AI query we'll receive this message so that means the bot press is answering correctly now we just need to set up our stack AI API so that we're able to answer more difficult questions using the same information now to do this part of course you're going to need a stack AI account but it's free to sign up there's a link to sign up in the description once you're in here with an account you're going to be able to scroll down to the document and database templates super easy to set up click on the document database q a and then we're going to click on the document q a here so in just a few clicks you've got the entire document query system set up I just need to click to upload here up upload that same document that I had from the client that's going to take it a few seconds here to just learn once we've got the OK there then we can play around with this prompt a little bit a quick explain it on what's going on here this is a input node so this is where we're going to be sending our query from the user so it's going to be essentially filling this up programmatically once we get the import it's going to query the documents it's going to return some of those documents that are relevant to the query and it's going to insert it into this prompt template here so the question is going to be coming from the input and then the context is going to be coming from this here so it's inserting a couple relevant chunks say ask about what kind of martial arts do you offer it's going to return a few chunks that are relevant to that query insert it into this context via this variable here then we're also going to insert the user import and say okay now answer this question given this information we've retrieved from our document so we have a little opportunity here to do some prompt engineering I think GPT 3.5 turbo here as the model is completely fine I have the prompt here you can take a look at that essentially answer the question quickly this is who you're from and always try to bend the app to make it sound like we are the perfect solution to the problem now I can give you a quick example of this in action so if I say my son is two years old can he start lessons so if I click run up here we can see what the response is going to be we typically start teaching martial arts at 4 to 14 but we do offer two child children as young as three so you've got a nice answer which is tailored to the user's question which is not really what WordPress does this is actually using a language model like GPT 3.5 turbo to really bend that and make it a personalized response and this personalization of the answer to what they're actually asking is the main advantage of using a stack AI query over the native bot press one once we've done this quick setup within stack AI all we need to do is click to deployment and I can go to document q a here you can see what the JavaScript API call looks like now if you're not technical don't freak out I'm going to be giving you the exact code that you need this actually doesn't work directly bot press is a little bit weird and you have to dumb it down quite a bit so the code block that we're actually going to be using is going to be available in the description I have a little document for you has to be able to get all of the code that I mentioned in this and you can just copy and paste over or use to give the chat GPT to answer to generate more similar ones so going back to bot press now I'm going to grab an execute code block I'm going to paste in this code here and then I'm going to go back to stack Ai and I'm going to grab this URL so getting back over delete that comma so we've set up the endpoint correctly now I just need to add my Bearer token which is my API key which you guys won't be able to see but you can get your API key for stack AI by coming up to the right corner and going to Keys then copying your key and heading back and pasting it in instead of these three dots I'm going to create a new variable called API response up here for response from just we can save that and so in here you can see we're going to be sending off as our input so this is to the input field of the stack AI application we're going to be sending the question that we captured here so when the user asks us a question we're going to capture that and save it to the variable of question if we're not able to answer from the bot press knowledge base it's going to come down to the stack AI query we're going to use that same query send it off as part of the payload and we're going to be using this workflow.question as the input then what we receive back as the output is going to be captured in this API response variable that we just created so that we can use it in the next steps we can add in a text card here and then set it to API response so that's going to be the response from stack AI we get to print that out as a response to the user's query and once we have replied to them with the stack AI response we can delete this routing here we just need to click on this little red line and then we need to take this always just up to the further questions so that we've replied to the question now we take them back to this node here which is going to say do you have any further questions and it starts it all over again and if they say no it's going to take them to the end and if they say yes it's going to take them back up to the knowledge query and we say what would you like to know so we've got this infinite Loop running where we can ask questions to the the knowledge base and then it's going to go to the stack AI if it isn't able to answer it and then at the end if they have no questions they can send them off to the end of the chatbot with the custom knowledge base query out of the way we can get onto the other interesting function that you guys will probably want to see which is to be able to capture leads so we can start here with a text we start the process of lead capture off with this question here which is uh when we say great the best way to start a program we start off the process for lead capture with this single Choice section here which is do you have any questions regarding getting started one of the options is email me the info so then it's going to take them to this node up here and we say sure we have full information pack on all of our classes and offers next card we put in is going to be the email capture so you want to ask them a question up here of please provide your email below this is automatically set to being an email address you want to add this to the email variable and that's going to save that then we can add in the full name person name [Music] then we ask please provide your full name that's going to be saved to the name variable then we need a custom code block to execute the zapier query this is the code that you're going to need right here I'm actually going to create a new variable called zapier success we're going to set this to a Boolean save that and so inside this execute code block you can see we have the zapier success value so we're going to set it as false initially we're going to take all of this lead data which is saved to our variable so the workflow name the workflow email the workflow who for all of the information that we've captured already we're going to add as the payload for this API call then we're going to try to make a post request as API here using the URL provided now in this video I don't have time to show these atheist hit up side of things but it's very straightforward you just create a zpu account you set up a custom web hook you're going to be able to get an API endpoint that you can put into this field here I've actually deleted half of mine but you'll be able to paste that directly into there essentially all you're going to be doing is setting up a custom web hook or API and allowing to send data to it and it's going to push it to a Google sheet so you need to create a Google sheet create these these column names of name email who for ETC and that the the data is going to fill out that sheet and the way that you tell it to so go with this APS set that up and then you're going to be able to come back and paste in the URL that they provide into this part here and then when that comes back as a success it's going to sit the new variable as true and then we're going to be able to move on to the next part of the application now we need a little transition here which is going to take us if this has been successful so we can type fzp success is true and the AI feature here was able to actually get this right for us now if that poster crisp went through and it came back with a zps success is true we're going to go to a new node here we're going to create a new bit of text added on after they've submitted their information and the zap has gone through correctly we say perfect we'll be in touch with you shortly and then off make them a offer of 50 off you can sort of insert anything you want in here and after that we want to again transition we're going to ask them if they have any further questions so this is going to be an always so we can set that to true and then grab this end and send this all the way down to the further queue so it's going to be going from the standard two down to the further questions and ask them if they have any other questions and as a basic fallback what we can add in here is a text mentioning an error occurred a boarding and then we can always send this to drop in another expression here we can make this true this is essentially error handling we're just going to take this to the end if the zapier a post request doesn't go through we're just going to send it to the end of course and in later versions of the app you can set it up so that it fails much better than just sending it to the end but for the scope of this video I can't show you the full setup like that zooming out on our application it seems that we've almost finished it off there's just one little part to do left which is to fill out the bottom half of this which is if you've chosen that it's martial arts for my child so we can very very quickly pass through that now I don't want to drag this out too much more name Mr why are you here to come in and add a text card that's great we have an excellent kids program here at Superstar martial arts single choice in here I'm going to ask them why do you want them to learn martial arts training and we can save the user input to the Y lessons variable which we used previously as well we can reuse that in this part of the application and then we're going to ask them a few things give them a couple options options we're going to give them are build confidence build strength learn discipline all of the above now that we'll capture that information we can actually turn off all of these custom routes and then we just hit and always so once they've received that information saved it to the variable we can route this always set this to true and then we get the next node save this one to why martial arts kids we're going to add a custom code Block in here first I'm going to paste this in here you guys will be able to get all of this it's the same thing that we're doing before which is based on what they've asked this is the same process as in the adult tree which is above have been over that it's just hitting this next message variable to a personalized message depending on what they've answered in the previous node then of course we need to add our next message response at next message the next card we need to add in here is a single choice so we can drag in a single Choice here we're going to say the question as do you have a martial art in mind we're going to save this to the type of martial art variable that we've created above so you might be able to tell that these are mirroring each other but we've just gone for one side as with the kids and one side is with the dots the options that we're going to have here kick boxing MMA karate same as above we can turn off all of these connectors and then we need to get an always transition down the bottom true send it up to the top and with that final connection I think we are ready to go uh we have finished things up here from a high level what we have built here is a chat bot that helps customers to get information about the business to find products that are best for them to help them feel like it's a personalized process of getting to the right class or finding the right martial art for what they need and Etc finding the right class for their kid we have ai aspects of custom knowledge based querying using bot press and stack AI we have uh lead capture that sends to a Google sheet via zapier integration here and then the beautiful thing about bot press is once we've finished all of this we can very very easily just click publish in the top right corner here we can see we've successfully published the bot now we're able to go back to our home page and click on the we can refresh the page and click on Integrations and then we have all of these options as to how we can actually hand this bot over to the client so in this case I was using a web chat so here you can see we can go to the pre-configured and copy this link paste it yeah and then we're able to chat to our chatbot on a hosted web page so we can send this link to clients so you can have a chat to it they can send this link to their own clients whatever they want to do so we can say hi then we can go through all of the things that we've just set up so maybe we go down to the child throughout this time we have an excellent kids program here why do you want them to start martial arts training I want them to learn discipline discipline is a foundational aspect of all martial arts what martial art do you have in mind why not karate karate is well known for instilling discipline and its practitioners we have classes every Friday with our discipline coach John would you like more information on how to get started uh I have a question do I need to be fit to start classes no you don't need to be fit to start classes people are start at varying Fitness levels Etc do you have any further questions no I think we're good so that's one way of interacting with this bot just one example you can go back to bot press and you can take the script tag and you can send this to clients and they can put it on their website and it will pop up as I showed you at the beginning of the video you're going to be able to add this handy little UI and actually customize this UI if you want to take this a step further but this is going to be able to be put on any website that your client wants and if you want to get fancy you can even experiment with some of these other deployment options that you have from bot press that can help you to provide different services to your clients and make more money so that is about all for the video guys well done for making it this far I hope you've been able to follow along and get something similar to this duplicated in your own bot press so then you can make edits to it you can play around with the different features and I know it can be sort of overwhelming getting started I hope this has been a nice entry point for you to get familiar with bot press to get familiar with stack AI familiar with the kind of integration you could do between the two and I urge you to just keep playing around keep experimenting keep trying to build different types of chat Bots and exploring some of the other features like the AI side of Bot press Etc now over this has been useful for you you're definitely going to want to join my community Discord which is available in the pin comment and the description I do workshops there every week and weekly q

model and have no clue where to start or even having no clue what kind of services you can actually begin to offer to businesses so in this video I'm going to be walking you through the first and most important step of picking your Niche so that you have a clear plan on who your target audience is what kind of problems you're going to be solving for them and most importantly how solving those problems is going to get you paid not only am I going to be sharing with you guys the exact framework and criteria that myself and my team use to analyze niches but I'm also going to throw in four specific examples of niches and specific products and services that you can sell within those niches at the end of the video so that you guys can get started straight away so if you're new to the channel my name is Liam otley and I run my own AI development and AI automation agency called Morningside AI we help businesses both large and small to build custom coded AI applications and create new AI products but we also work with businesses as an AI AI automations partner will be going into a top to bottom analysis of the business and where AI Technologies can be applied to decrease expenses and at the end of the day increase profits I've been doing online business since I left High School which is coming up for five years ago now I'm originally from New Zealand but now I'm based in Dubai if you haven't noticed I'm actually back in Dubai now after about two months away it's good to be back I think I'll be here for a week or two before heading off again now before you take advice from some random guy on the internet you probably want to figure out what kind of results can you expect and what kind of results are you getting so on screen here we have my results I've done forty five thousand dollars profit in the previous month just passed I actually did a full breakdown of that 45 000 a month which will be available up here for you to check out as you can see on screen here we're on track to smash our goal of one hundred thousand dollars in revenue for the month of June and just below that you can see we have a near-term goal of one hundred thousand dollars profit per month which gives you an idea of the kind of position we're at and where we hope to be in sort of the next three to six months so with all of that out of the way we can get down to the good stuff now the first question you should be asking before you even ask what Niche should I build in you need to be out asking should you even start an AI automation agency to begin with now if you're not familiar with what an AI automation agency is I've actually just done a full breakdown on my philosophy and my sort of thought process for why I'm going all in on my AI automation agency and in that video I do a full breakdown of what the business model is what kind of things you can deliver you'll need to go and watch that video by clicking up here somewhere once you've watched that come back to this and you'll be ready to get started should you start an AI automation agency from my experience of working and building businesses within AI for the past year AI automation agencies are by far the best on-ramp for entrepreneurs looking to get into AI building any kind of AI startup is just not feasible for beginners because it requires such extensive skills in the first place you need resources you need connections and all of those sort of have to come together for you to be able to get any kind of money out of a startup in the near term I would know I'm literally doing an AI startup Challenge on this channel right now if you haven't seen that it's going to be linked up here somewhere and so on one extreme we have ai startups which take tons of resources and skills and then on the other side we have these gimmicky blog posting businesses use chat GMT to write SEO articles and stuff like that so the good thing about AI automation agencies is that it can fall right in the middle of those two things so on the extreme you have startups and on the other side you have these gimmicky little make 200 with SEO posts the best part about running an AI automation agency is that you get to work with AI Hands-On every single day and you get to see this technology for what it truly is very few people right now actually understand AI technology and what its strengths and weaknesses are and have the vision of being able to see where this thing goes and where it can be moving in the future and I can tell you firsthand from my own experience that the learning and knowledge that you're able to get from running these businesses is immeasurable and there's no other way to get it right now you can't get it from watching YouTube videos you can't get it from researching blog articles if the past three months have rolled by and have continued to be a spectator of AI watching YouTube videos and just keeping up with the news just know that that will put you dead in the middle of the pack bang on average in terms of all of the people who want to participate in this market but at the same time there's people like those in my Discord and those running businesses like myself who are learning at a rate that's far more rapid than you could ever get from watching YouTube videos right now you have an early mover advantage to start your own AI automation agency because businesses have not been offered AI Automation Services before so it's going to be so much easier to sell them on this brand new offer than in a year or two years time so with that rant out of the way I hope I've backed up my point here of this being the best on-ramp for entrepreneurs into AI because you get to work with these businesses and work with this technology day in day out and learn at a rate that far exceeds all these other people who are just watching YouTube videos and trying to keep up and not actually doing it if you've been running one of these agencies for six months to a year at scale you're going to be in the perfect position both financially and with the skills and knowledge you have to springboard onto bigger AI startups and bigger opportunities from there within the AI space and I couldn't truly call this the best on-ramp for entrepreneurs into AI if it didn't have things like zero startup cost you can start to sell these services and as soon as you get paid then you can start paying your Freelancers so you don't need any money to start the site you can use a Gmail you can use a free work site whatever it is you don't need to have thousands of dollars to start one of these things and to address probably your biggest objection no you do not need to know how to code you do not need to be a developer to start this your job as a business owner is to understand how to apply these different AI Technologies into a business to increase their profits increase their efficiency Etc you do not need to be doing the work yourself you can hire Freelancers you can hire contractors come in and deliver the work for you and finally the last little point that I threw in here this is an online business model so of course you have complete location Freedom as I've just said I've been in the Caribbean I've been in Colombia for two months I've been into the United States I'm now back in Dubai for a week or two and then I'm going to Europe for summer so I can travel wherever I want in the world or using this business model and of course my other income streams as well now if that all checks out for you I may have something of interest to you here I'm actually starting up what I'm calling the original eight program which is going to be a group of eight community members that I will be coaching and group coaches at sort of one-on-one private messaging Etc now this is going to be my little group of guinea pigs I'm going to be teaching everything I know teaching them how to start their own AI automation agency how to craft the offer how to pick their deliverables I'm going to be teaching them everything and group calls private messaging Etc I'm going to be holding their hand through this entire process that I'm going to show you in this video of Niche selection we're going to be putting into practice all of the strategies that I've formulated for complete beginners with no skills and no YouTube channel Etc and see what results we can get them so if that sounds even remotely interesting to you you're going to be able to join my Discord with the link in the description or the pin comment you can join the Discord and then keep an eye on announcements it's going to be released as a form that you can fill out an application it's going to be released on June the 18th for only 24 hours so you're going to want to make sure that your notifications for that announcements Channel and for the Discord server are on and then within a few days I'm going to be announcing who the original AR and we'll be getting stuck in straight away now a key question to ask when deciding on your Niche is should I even Niche down to begin with this is a very common trap that business owners and myself included can fall into which is trying to be a generalist and saying I'll just take any business that comes my way why would I turn anyone down but I as we're going to go through here you'll see that that's perhaps not the best way to do it unfortunately well fortunately by trying to cater to everybody you end up actually serving no one well Alex from Ozzy actually illustrates us very very well with an example from Dan Kennedy we can use the example of a time management course how much could you sell a time management course for now unless you're some world-renowned time management Guru chances are you probably couldn't charge that much for them so let's just say 19 for a general time management course now imagine making that product a little bit more specific time management for sales professionals okay maybe we can sell this for 99 now we can even go more specific to time management for B2B outbound sales reps now that you're dealing with sales reps if you can help them get just one more sale a month then you could potentially charge up to 500 or 4 4.99 we can even take it one step further to time management for B2B outbound Power Tools and Gardening sales reps so that is extremely specific and some people out there are going to go wow this sounds like it's made exactly for me and when you go that specific how much can you charge this is made exactly for their Avatar maybe two thousand dollars and now the key thing thing about this entire thought process is that it could essentially be the same or a very very similar product at the 20 price point and at the two thousand dollar price point by niching down to a very very specific customer we've been able to charge 100 times more for essentially the same product and those are the kind of markups and margins that you need to Succeed in Business everything I've just told you can be applied to AI automation agencies as well by niching down not only are you able to sell your product for more but then all of your messaging and your websites and your emails in your ad copy everything you're able to make this hyper targeted to a specific customer and make it feel like you're speaking to them and at the end of the day that's going to increase your response rate increase your clerks increase your conversion rate and again it's another layer of making more money not only are you charging more money you're able to get higher conversions from your Advertiser and the final mail that I'm going to put in the coffin if you still want to be Mr General the only way that you can scale an AI automation agency with a lean and small team is by servicing the same clients over and over and over so that team is not in a constant state of chaos of trying to figure out what can we offer these guys how can we hack these Services together what different Tech stack and products are we going to use it's constant chaos unless you can streamline down and say this is our Niche these are the things that we deliver and then they can get better and better and more efficient over time for example you can specialize in info product businesses and figure out five really high impact and really valuable deliverables to provide to that Niche your team can then dial in and become experts on delivering those five things and after a while you're going to see all the different variations of what these businesses look like in terms of their back-end systems and things like that but at some point you're going to have seen so many examples that you basically have a way of dealing with every situation and then from there for you as the business owner that is complete peace of mind and knowing that your team is not going to run into any hiccups so that you can sleep at night and you can have the location and time Freedom that you need and that you really want out of a business model like this now that we're clear on the many reasons why you should be niching down in the first place I can explain how you should be choosing your Niche now unfortunately blanket statement saying this is the best Niche this is the best Niche you should do this you should do this doesn't really help anyone well if you have different experiences and backgrounds and skills Etc what I can do for you is give you a framework for which you can identify your own Niche and by doing that and allowing you to come to the conclusion yourself you're going to be so much more confident and set on the niche rather than just some dude telling you first step and my criteria for choosing a niche is that they need to have money to spend not that difficult to wrap your head around we either have say a mom-and-pop restaurant on one side or we have a online coaching business or we have a family-run motel versus a online marketing agency I'm not saying that you can't provide services to these ones but these ones are going to have a lot more money to spend and therefore allow you to make a ton more money with less customers essentially and in terms of the clients that you're going to be dealing with as well the ones who don't have a lot of money are going to be on average more difficult to deal with and more on your case more picky about how you're spending the money Etc but the ones with lots of money lovely to work with the most cases secondly customers within your Niche need to be easy to Target now the first side of this is obviously digital is it going to be easy to run ads to them is it easy to Target them and Market to them online but then on the other sides also do they have any organizations or groups that you're going to be able to access easily and tap in to potentially get marketing on this sort of newsletter or things like that so you're online and then you have traditional groups and networks of say doctors or dentists Etc so before you pick your Niche either have a quick think hey if I wanted to get in front of these people how would I do it and if you can't think of anything off the top of your head maybe you need to go and do some research you can just Google some stuff figure out what newsletters or groups they have Etc if you can't find anything probably not the best and now thirdly one of the more difficult ones to understand is what I'm calling vulnerable or optimized and finish is vulnerable to AI or optimized to benefits hugely from AI I think both provide good opportunities one side is obviously they're excited about being able to scale their business or make a ton more money with AI on the other side they are terrified about losing their jobs or their business not staying competitive and stuff like that so both good angles you can sell to and that's why I've got them on the same line here being either vulnerable or optimized now this comes down to the actual nature of AI technology and we have some industries that are on the chopping luck right now and others that stand to gain a lot from the technology an example of a vulnerable Niche right now would be legal because AI is doing a lot of the written and document analysis work that they are typically been required to do and they've been able to charge a lot of money for so there's a huge wave of panic that's going to the legal industry right now that AI is going to come and take a huge cut of their business so if you can help legal businesses stay on The Cutting Edge of AI and implement it to stay ahead of their competitors and stay ahead of this impending doom then they'll pay you a lot of money for it and on the other side what I see as an optimized Niche or industry is the coaching business with AI chatbots like my homozy GPT which will be linked up here if you want to check that out coaching businesses are now able to break through and break past what was always and traditionally the biggest handbrake on a coaching business which is being able to scale their knowledge and scale their teachings now you can put all of a coaching businesses information into a chat bot and then you can offer a new service as say hey if you want to add like a downsell to your offer and say hey you can't chat to me directly but I'm going to have an AI chatbot that you can talk to and get access to all of my course content and all of my teachings but you can just chat chatbot not to me so that kind of deliverable in particular offers a potentially huge Roi for the client so that makes it easier not only to sell them on it but also you can charge them more money for it so with vulnerable and optimized businesses you're either selling them Peace of Mind from impending doom which they pay a lot for or a massive increase in earning potential a completely new offer for their business which they will also pay a lot of money for and I thought I'd throw in a final Point here of familiarity if you are familiar with a niche say you've been working a corporate job you've been working some kind of industry for the past five ten years you're very familiar with it it's going to make more sense for you to go in there because you already know what the bottlenecks in the businesses are and how you could apply the technology you're going to be Head and Shoulders above but I would say this could almost be a bad thing because you might go into a bad Niche you might have experience in a niche that doesn't fit these categories that we've just gone through so be very careful about it have a thing is this actually going to be beneficial for me or am I just going the easy path so it might be better to go elsewhere so you're done right you've picked your Niche not quite if you're a beginner for absolute beginners there is one more step you need to Niche down even further this time to waste specific deliverable within that Niche so you're not attacking the entire Niche like hey I help legal firms to automate their business and apply AI technology now put yourself in the position of someone who's never been inside a legal firm before and you're trying to start this business that will make your head spin you have no clue where to start you have no clue what systems they have running you're just completely lost and hopeless at that point starting a new business can be extremely daunting and difficult so you really want to simplify things as much as possible down to the bare minimum and trying to service clients for a full automation package within a niche and their big ask for a beginner but if you just start with one high impact High Roi deliverable within your Niche and you find success with that first from there you're going to be able to set up your systems and your teams and build things out in a gradual process say when you're into these businesses and you create them the first deliverable you might be able to have conversations with them and say hey what other aspects of your business could I take a look at could I find some automations for here what kind of chatbot would you potentially need for this and slowly start to add more to your service offering over time but just don't overwhelm self initially Niche down to one specific Niche and one specific deliverable get started and then you can think about being a bit more bold and taking on additional services that you can offer as I say in my other videos you need to be using some kind of Trojan Horse to get into these businesses to lure them in and then convince them that you're an AI expert and that you're able to deliver these services for them and in most cases the AI chatbot right now is the sort of buzzword the Hot Topic that all business owners are interested in so if you can use that you can sell them even just a low ticket offer of a chat bot and then from there you can get more familiar with servicing those you can build up your testimonials and results and then from there once you get in with that low ticket offer you could potentially say hey but I also offer this automation package for your email system that cost three thousand dollars this Trojan Horse method is so powerful right now because business owners are aware of AI they've heard it floating around and it's exciting to them it's all this new technology that's potentially Limitless and could unlock my business in so many different ways it's like intelligence but it's on demand that's repeatable it doesn't get tired and they have this idea that it could potentially help them you just need to come to them without offering with a clear plan on how you can apply to their business and they'll probably let you in the door if they need a little bit more motivation you can tell them that they're entire industry is moving in this direction as you speak now I know that for many of you this idea of niching down to a specific industry is straightforward enough but perhaps niching down to a specific deliverable is a bit more ambiguous so I thought I'd give you four Ultra specific examples being very specific about their Niche and also about the deliverable might give you a better idea of the kind of offerings you could essentially do for businesses firstly we have an internal knowledge and toolbot for social media marketing agencies a chatbot like this can be very useful for agencies in order to get everyone in the business on the same page without having to have sort of person-to-person communication you can have all of information about particular clients all built into the same chat bot you can have different tools like I want to generate a website homepage or things like this you can build those into the bot this can be very very useful at increased productivity for social media marketing agencies secondly we have ai integrated Ultra personalized email flows for tax law firms so super specific on the niche side and also on the deliverable side to start with something like this you can go to a law firm and offer to try and re-engage the cold or stale leads now you can go really deep on these kind of things but essentially you'd be using something like zapier to connect to their CRM and when a certain trigger is hit you're going to pull information from the CRM on that customer use that to generate a custom email flow a personalized email flow based on that contact and then that should result in an increased response rate if you've done it right thirdly we have 24 7 AI coaches for wealth coaching businesses so this is using the example I explained earlier in this video we are able to create a custom knowledge base and essentially allow customers or clients of the coaching business to get access to the information via AI chatbot could be a very high value service to someone who owns a coaching business and finally a lead nurturing and capture chat bot for HR SAS businesses so you can have this kind of thing embedded on their home page and it helps prospects and people who are interested in their products to find the right product and at the end of it you can capture their lead insert it into the database and they can trigger all their sort of email flows and marketing off of that I hope that these examples show you just how specific you can be not only on the niche side of things but also on the deliverables so if you can combine a hot Niche with lots of money to spend easy to Target Etc all the criteria that I mentioned earlier with a really high value and high Roi deliverable then you're going to start off your AI automation Agency on the absolute best foot you can now these are just a few ideas intended to help get your ideas flowing but feel free to steal them verbatim if you just want to get started straight away now the process of identifying possible deliverables and then deciding on which one you want to move forward with there's actually an entirely different process to just choosing your Niche alone so I'm working on a video for that currently for you guys in that video I'm going to be doing a full breakdown on how to construct a killer AI automation agency offer of which your first deliverable is obviously going to play a massive part so I'm going to roll that's choosing your deliverable side with the constructing your offer because they're intertwined and hard to separate I really want to do justice to the topic of selecting a deliverable and crafting the offer because if you get that right that Foundation as I mentioned has laid so well and makes it so much easier for the rest of the time building the business for now I think it would be very very useful for all of you watching this to go out and do a bit of your own research sketch out a few niches on a bit of paper and start to apply that same criteria that I went through with you earlier in this video and start to figure out who your finalists might be and who you could potentially move forward with as your Niche and then you're ready for that offer and deliverable video to come out next and that about wraps up the video guys well done for making it all the way through I just want to Point again a reminder to the original eight program that is starting soon I really want to get some really really good talent into that program so that we can have a great start so again 100 free incubator inside my Discord with

your own AI automation agency I'm going to be explaining to you guys my entire thought process and philosophy really of why I'm going all in on my AI automation agency right now and why I think it is the perfect on-ramp for entrepreneurs getting into AI right now and no you do not need to be a developer you don't need to know how to code in order to run an AI automation agency like this at the end of the video I'm going to be sharing a few tips on how you guys can actually get started in building your own AI automation agency today foreign automation agencies are the next big thing and how you can start your own you can see an acronym here of AAA or Triple A of course referring to AI automation agencies you're going to see this throughout the presentation now of course a little bit of information about me if you're new to the channel my name is Liam otley and I have my own AI development and AI automation agency called Morningside AI we help businesses both large and small to create custom coded AI applications and build completely new AI products but we also work with businesses as an AI automation partner which is what you're going to be hearing about in this video but we come into businesses into a top to bottom analysis of everything they're doing where the bottlene XR and how AI can be applied to their business to at the end of the day reduce expenses and increase profit for them and from New Zealand originally but I'm now based in Dubai at the moment we're in Florida I'm about to fly out to Dubai tomorrow so you'll see me back in the studio probably in the next video now I understand it before you commit to even watching a video from some guy on the internet like this you'll probably want to know what's in it for me and what potential results could I get from this I can at least mention what I've been doing myself and across my different AI income streams last month I did about 45 000 profits you can see the full breakdown of that in a video that's going to be linked up here somewhere that figure does include my YouTube income and Consulting income but here you can see the second point on screen which is we are on track to smash our goal of 100 000 of revenue for June so that's on the agency side of things which is what I'm going to be explaining here so hopefully by the end of the month I'll be able to do a full breakdown as I did with the 45 000 profit but this time showing you guys all of the different clients we serviced for this so hopefully stay tuned stay subscribed for that because that's coming at the end of the month if all goes well the final Point here is that we are aiming for a hundred thousand dollar profit month in the near term so that's three to six months out what we're aiming for gives you an idea of the kind of numbers that we're doing and how quickly we think we're going to grow enough talking about me let's get stuck into square one which is what is an AI automation agency what I'm calling an AI automation agency is an online business model where you work with businesses either on a contract or attain a basis to help them apply AI Technologies and allow them to benefit from the productivity gains of this new technology the in goal goal and benefit that you're providing to these businesses of course is that you're going to help them reduce their expenses and increase their profit over the long term this can be done by using AI technology to augment their existing staff members to be able to do more work in less time or being able to completely replace or automate roles so that they don't have to pay them in the first place now the key thing here and something that you're probably already stressing about is how you actually service these clients the best part about this business model and the thing that makes it so beginner friendly and scalable is that you're not actually creating custom coded solutions for these clouds each time you're using low code or no code tools to create chat Bots to create content generation system to create AI enabled zapier flows which means that you as the business owner do not need to know how to build software and when it comes to hiring people you have a huge pool of people to hire from because they don't need to be a super Advanced AI developer to begin with this means that you're able to hire and train contractors easily so that you're able to get them to deliver the services and you can take a step back so what kind of deliverables or Services can you provide to these clients at this stage this is really an open-ended question and is only really limited by your creativity and ability to identify things within a business that need AI implementations to improve but to go through some of the obvious deliverables we have internal and external chat Bots that can integrate some kind of custom knowledge base feature particularly we have content generation systems which allow businesses to leverage databases full of old content and use that to create new content we have ai enhances API flows to connect different parts of the business and you can even provide what I'm calling AI Consultants which is an AI that can access business data and provide assistance to the business owner and making decisions now as you can see you can either build them per deliverable so you do a contract per chat bot or per content generation system or you can make a package for a monthly retainer and start to get paid with some recurring income from your clients by packaging it all together so how did I discover this and why have I gone all in on becoming a triple A owner originally with Morningside AI my development company we were only really doing custom coded Solutions which means these were typically a lot more pricey they were higher ticket development clients which meant that we were not able to service a large amount of the leads that were coming through so as you can see here I said I wanted to find a way to service these lower ticket clients we were getting because we were getting through my YouTube channel as well we were getting so many requests for one to 5K projects and we just based on the amount of admin that it requires and the amount of calls I have to get on my business partner has to get on it was not worth our time to be trying to go after these one to five thousand dollar clients so myself and the team started to explore these different bot building tools that would essentially allow us to service the custom knowledge chatbot clients which we were getting so many of with these different tools by not having to custom code everything from the ground up we could use these tools and use these platforms to essentially slice that development cost in half and if the client wasn't too worried about it being built on a bot builder then we weren't wear it either and as it turned out these lower ticket clients were actually a lot more appealing to us because of the decreased admin because they're not asking for a huge contract they don't expect a lot of communication they don't expect me to get on calls there's less unknowns and that the kind of stuff that they're asking to be built is very easy very straightforward we don't need to do any guesswork in terms of how we scope the project and for these reasons I realized that it was potentially more scalable than the high ticket development side of the business and so we pivoted a section of the business to focus on only servicing these smaller clients and building out the teams and really mapping out the different Services we can provide and when I realize that if you combine these lower ticket clients with a cluster or a collection of different deliverables you can sell them on a retainer model and that would be a a retainer-based business model that can earn you 10 20 30 50 000 a month now with all of that background out of the way I can get into showing you guys the four key points that I've identified that have made me go all in and what I think you guys will need to hear as well for you to make the same decision so firstly AI automation agencies are servicing a huge and very scared market right now in order to understand this problem we need to take a step back and look at what AI can actually do for businesses so we have an increase in human productivity you can do more work and less time secondly you can replace entire roles within a business by automating the task thirdly you can improve access to important business data through chat Bots that have connected to the databases and because of that ability you can actually help business owners make better decisions about their business and all of this boils down to an increased profit for the business but which business this is a talking about what businesses can actually benefit from this all of them basically all businesses right now can benefit from AI in some way or they will be able to benefit from it in some way in the future so the opportunity that this presents us with as AI automation agency owners is the mother of all markets basically all businesses right now can benefit from some kind of AI implementation and what's more important is that business owners are aware of AI right now but they don't understand it and more so they have anxiety about how it's actually going to affect their livelihoods and affect their business I see this every single day when I get on Consulting calls business owners are scared they are concerned about how it's going to affect their business that they've worked on for 10 20 30 years and the key Point here is that they're going to pay for peace of mind you can provide the solution to this anxiety now if you don't believe me that AI has the potential to affect basically every business in the world well at least in the in the places that you guys are probably watching from we have Goldman Sachs here saying that AI could push s p profits up by 30 in the next decade and the key thing here is that over the next 10 years a AI could increase productivity by 1.5 percent per year now that productivity gain is not just going to happen magically businesses need to implement it into their processes and into their businesses in order for that to trickle down we have this new technology which is now offering to improve businesses in a number of ways it's going to take years or decades for this to trickle down and affect all of the different parts of the economy your job as an AI automation agency owner is to facilitate this implementation and make money as this disperses through the economy now the same things about productivity increases were said throughout the late 90s and early 2000s regarding the productivity increases created by the World by web and the internet and what happened it took decades for businesses to start to have an online presence in the form of a website and then it took decades again for all businesses to have some kind of social media presence which now having a website and a social media account and social media ads is absolutely vital for basically any business on the planet my point here is that the technology and productivity gains took years to trickle down and it was the companies who facilitated the transitions for businesses to move into the digital space that made a ton of money you have huge web development companies you have huge digital marketing agencies and I thought I'd put even one more example just to really drive this home for you guys if you're not sold yet about how big this opportunity is and here we have Google cloud and Google just launching their consulting services like the day of me writing this so we have this little post here they say that they're going to be assisting clients with using generative AI to identify Trends boost Automation and generate content AKA everything I've just said in the video up until now Google is now officially launched their own division of helping large businesses large corporations to do the exact same thing identify things in their business that could benefit from Ai and allow them the information and assistance to get it integrated and benefit from the new technology and the last Point here is important as well there is a huge number of businesses that need this but they won't be able to get it from Google so they're not these huge corporate companies who can afford those Consulting Services your job is going to be servicing the smaller medium businesses that aren't going to be working Google cloud or any of the big dogs so in summary you're going to be selling to almost any business on the planet you're going to be selling not only an increase in profitability that business owners love you're also going to be selling them a solution to their anxiety which is a huge huge selling point and finally it could potentially take decades for these AI productivity gains to trickle down through businesses so you have a very very long time Horizon to build this business on and to look ahead and say look I'm going to be building this for the next five or ten years now the second reason why this is the next big thing for online business is that there is no skills needed necessarily to build one of these so you're probably familiar with the stuff by now but we have the freelancer model and the agency model firstly as a freelancer you're going to be the service provider yourself and you're actually delivering this you're building the Bots you're communicating with the clients and getting this thing made and then secondly we have the agency model where you are elevated above the service providers and you've contracted it out to other people I would recommend to anyone looking to start one of these businesses to start off as a freelancer get familiar with the technology the learning curve is not that steep it's fairly easy to get your head around and then you can step into the agency model and start to contract out to people much much easier that way than trying to come in and not know anything about Service delivery but essentially it's very very low low skills required and if you're really determined you can just jump straight to the agency model and get people to figure it out for you more importantly running an AI automation agency does not require you to be a coded does not required that you need to know how to develop software Your Role instead is to be the business owner where you handle finding customers selling customers how to manage the teams and of course hiring the people to do the service delivery if you take a step back the skill that you're building is actually how to apply AI Technologies to businesses that's what you're getting better at that's the meta skill of the AI automation agency owner now thirdly we have zero startup costs which is pretty straightforward it's an agency model so you're getting paid first before you ever have to Fork out any money there's essentially zero risk to start especially if you're freelancing because you can say hey I'll give you this thing and if it doesn't work I'll just completely refund you so it's just your time you're potentially going to lose rather than having people hired on straight away that you're going to lose money on now actually have a zero to 10K AI automation agency case study which I'm planning at the the moment which should be out soon so keep an eye out for that but essentially you can use a Gmail a Wix site and canva Logo very very basic free things to get yourself to that point where you can start reaching out to customers and as I said before if you're doing this as a freelancer you can come in with an irresistible offer like if you don't get the results that you want within x amount of time I'll completely refund you no risk so the offer can be very very irresistible when you're coming in and pitching it as a freelancer initially and finally Point number four is that this is a compounding business model that is going to get better with time so you are the product as the agency owner you are going to be the person you're selling yourself essentially selling your expertise and your ability as an agency owner to apply AR Technologies to businesses and get results for them so ideally you can track a number of different things with past clients which is hey we've reduced spend on this or we were able to eliminate x amount of support tickets or we lubricated internal Communications down to XYZ so those kind of Statistics as gold for you as an agency owner and that's going to help you land bigger and bigger clients in the future as you build more experience and you discover better deliverable balls for your clients that provide more value you get more case studies attached to your brand name and yourself then you can start to charge more and more money and I mean ideally you could be charging ten thousand dollars or more per month if you have the stats and the case studies to back it up now if you compare a compounding business model like this with a Drop Shipping Store it actually is inverted where Drop Shipping is easy to start with and gets harder and harder over time so I like this business model because it allows you to improve and it allows you to build credibility build a track record and start to charge more and more and more now hopefully after all of that you see things as I see it and see this as a business model for online entrepreneurs to get into AI That's low risk and start to get familiar with what technologies are out there and how you can service different clients and how it's actually improving businesses and you're probably going to be looking for the next bits of information which would be how to sign your first client and how to service that client so luckily I have a new video coming which is how to sign your first AI automation agency client will be going to be picking your AI automation agency Niche how to find potential customers how to contact pitch and close these prospects and how to price your services I've actually already released the

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be showing you step by step how you can service your very first AI automation client as a beginner using a real world example from a real client that I've signed in my business and that I have delivered the services for I'm going to be walking you through and showing you the behind the scenes of how I was servicing this client for the specific type of chatbot that they wanted and going you through all the phases of planning building deploying reviewing and eventually handing over as well so you're going to get to see the entire thing and this is going to be very helpful for any of you who are looking to start servicing clients with AI automation agency model and at the end of the video I'm going to throw in a little bonus module for you guys showing you the exact methods that myself and my company have been using to up to 5x their revenue per customer so all of that in this video let's get started now for those of you who are new to the channel my name is Liam otley I have my own AI development company and AI automation agency called Morningside AI we help businesses both large and small to create brand new AI applications and new AI powered products but we also come into businesses as an AI automation partner and build things like I'm going to show you in this video to apply AI to every aspect of the business to increase productivity and at the end of the day increase Revenue now you may have noticed the interesting background I'm actually on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean for a few more days I have a marathon this Sunday so please wish me luck for that on the screen we have an outline of the process of servicing your first AI client obviously signing comes in as a prerequisite at .00 and then we have planning building reviewing deploying and then finally how to 5x Revenue per customer which I'm going to be sharing with you at the end now you obviously can't service a client if you don't have a client's service so I thought I'd touch on this now briefly just to sort of let you guys know what I'm working on for you guys so that you can actually start signing your own clients I want to be 100 transparent with you guys and say all of my leads right now are coming from YouTube but in the process right now I mentioned this in my last video I'm working on a lead generation and cold Outreach method that once I've got working for myself and I'm able to prove that it's working not just because I've got a YouTube channel and because of my personal brand but because it's actually a good system I'm going to be ready to share that with you guys in the later videos so now we've seen some early success with it already and you can expect the video on this pretty soon so you want to be subscribed and hit the Bell so you're notified when it drops because after all the knowledge you're going to get in this video you're going to be so ready to sort of backfill it with the information on how you can get a client and you've just sort of got the full scope of how this business want to work now I assume for most of you guys this is going to be your first client so when you're going into this be aware that you're kind of looking for the low hanging fruit here you're not trying to sort of bite off more than you can chew especially when you're green and you're new delivering your services I would say stick to the chat Bots like the ones I'm going to show you in this video there's a few different variations and it depends really on the industry and the niche of the client you're serving there's a range of different things you can provide depending on each Niche so so ideally you're going to be picking a business that can benefit from what I'm going to show you because this is a specific example of a outwards facing chatbot that can cover a number of bases and provides quite a lot of value to a customer and to and to their clients as well as I said there is going to be a video coming on this but if you want to get your tea stuck in right now we actually have a bunch of really hungry people in the Discord that I'm hopping on calls with every week if you want to join that group and you want to get in there and start bouncing ideas off those people are kind of a little bit ahead of the curve because I'm in there but more often I'm able to help them and sort of push them in the right direction and the link to join is going to be in the description once you're inside you're going to get free access to the workshop calls that I do and the free weekly Q as and also rub shoulders with other people who are starting these businesses too and for you guys to all share information and I can even get in there and help you guys out a bit too firstly of course you need to identify the client's needs and figure out what value you can potentially provide with a chatbot like this now now for the case study client that I'm going to be showing you in a second they were looking for a chat bot that sort of outwards facing and it can help with a number of things including firstly lead nurturing where someone comes onto the site they click on the chat bot and they get sort of help to find the right products and services that match them in a personalized way secondly is lead capture so you're able to take them through a conversation you're able to collect a bunch of information about their intentions and what they want to get out of your service and out of your business and then you can sort of hit them with a lead capture capture their email or phone number thirdly you can push them to a conversion event like an external landing page or a link to book an a call or something like that and finally you can provide top tier customer support through a custom knowledge based feature within the chatbot now again to be 100 transparent this client was signed on a one thousand dollar payment this was discounted to that price based on a case study rate hence you are seeing this right now so this would typically be sort of two to three thousand dollar project but because this is a case study I discounted it down to a thousand dollars because I really wanted to show you guys something behind the scenes and as you can see on screen here here is my stripe dashboard I had some people uh chirping me before my previous videos about uh not providing proof so here it is I've refreshed the page Morningside Ventures which is my company in Dubai here we have three thousand Dirhams you guys can do the calculation on that and that comes out to one thousand dollars so obviously you're going to blur the customer name for a little bit of privacy there but here's my stripe dashboard showing that the payment has come through I was able to go back and forth with the client and figure out those four different things that we could provide value to the business which is essentially what your job is your job is to come in as a as a consultant and figure out and analyze how we can reduce expenses and increase Roi or increase the revenue of the business business by applying these tools so this chatbot is going to cover XYZ basis it's going to help you in XYZ ways so that is your job to identify them and help them get there now I will mention that this is just one type of chatbot there are so many different ways that these things can be applied it can be a Content generation system it can use a custom knowledge base to do this and internal use external use this so much I'd say for your first client maybe look to stick to something similar to what I'm building here just so you have the sort of handbook and how to deliver it and and the thought process behind it now that we've figured out the kind of functionality and value this bot was going to provide I had to request the requirements from the client which in this case I had the custom knowledge base requirement of the aspect of the chatbot that's going to be able to answer questions of a knowledge base so we sent that over it was essentially just question and answer question and answer question answer then I had to go back to the client and have a conversation and say okay these are objectives we want to get these done what kind of how does that look in terms of a chat bot so we can control the conversation quite a lot we can set up buttons we can set up this this what kind of information do you want to be collecting from the customer what kind of direction do you want to be pointing them to what conversion event just so once I'd got that information from the customer and figured out roughly what he wanted to do and where he wanted to take the conversation information Etc then I was able to take that to her figma board and plot it out so figma figma is great for this kind of thing because it's going to allow you to quickly draw up a nice little diagram of how the conversation flow is going to go the questions that will be asked the information that's captured so I'll show you here on screen actually a quick example of the figma what you can see on screen here is just the top line of the chat bot I didn't bother doing the entire thing because it was a fairly repetitive process but what you can see here as it starts what brought you here today martial arts myself martial arts my child Etc why are you looking for lessons and this is explaining how the conversation is going to go what information is being captured and then down here you can see this is sort of the open loop of what would you like to know and this is going to be querying the knowledge base so this is a rough breakdown of it I was able to show the client to this and then get validated on that and say yeah that looks good some of these texts are made up by myself and they're just placeholders but they can easily be changed later on once it's been approved you're ready to move on to the next stage of building now for this client my tech stack was a combination of Bot press as the base of the chatbot controlling the logic and the ascending of messages but then combining it with stack AI via apis to add the sort of more complex functionality and better knowledge based querying now I can give you a quick look behind the scenes on what this chatbot actually looks like in bot press as you can see it's fairly basic but this is because I was able to condense a lot of the logic down into a big JavaScript if else blocks so that was able to save a lot of a lot of visual clutter on here so we have a couple things if you're new to bot press you have what's called nodes each of these allows you to sort of do a bit of logic inside of it and then you can direct the the conversation with these transitions so we have messages you can send we have information capture which is going to give them options and you're able to save these two variables and and so on and so forth so I don't have time within this video to do a complete breakdown of all of this but I will give you a quick glance at it typically it's you send a message and you capture some information based on that decision you're going to Route them to the next node you're going to do it again ask them another question capture the information and then transition it and based on what was captured in that uh in that particular variable you can set it as the next message and do logic based off of that so you have these custom custom code blocks that allows you to set the next message and then finally the sort of meat and potatoes of this application that really makes it an AI chat bot is this uh this big column here what happens is once the conversation has progressed far enough and we have a bit of information from them we're able to essentially ask them if they want to be pushed to conversion event which is to a trial page to book and a call here we say would you like to book them for a trial sure tell me more or no I have a question if they have a question then we go through a knowledge query which we have a knowledge base over here filled with the client's q a information that they sent me and if that fails we have a fallback essentially to a stack AI block here you can see we have a API request that you can set up using the custom code blocks and if stack AI still can't answer the question using gpt4 or a language model that's better than what Bob press offers then we say okay I don't have an answer for that can you please try again so that allows us to open a sort of infinite Loop up with a customer can ask as many questions as they want and then after each question is answered it pushes them again to that conversion event so hey I have a question this is this okay but here's the answer to it uh would you like to book into Toronto or would you like to move forward would you like to go to the landing page so that's how this thing's set up it captures information along the along the question tree and then once you get to the end it's trying to push them to the conversion event now what I'm sitting up here in the near term for a V2 of the app is going to be a lead capture so it's going to take that information that we've taken taken from the various tips of the conversation and then ask for an email ask for a phone number and then we've captured all of that information now we have an enriched lead with clear intent and you have sort of a nice little package to start email marketing to SMS marketing too so very very good very cool and and this is this is the bot press side of things now I can show you quickly the stack AI side of things which is just a basic document search using GPT 3.5 turbo and then I'm able to call this as an API via bot press in order to give a a better knowledge base query than what Bob press offers because it's not that great as I said I don't have time in this video to go through every single step of that bar press build but if you want to get more info Nation about it I will be sharing it in Workshop calls on my Discord so be sure to head through there and you can get a bit more information and talk to some of the other people who are building them right now there's a little bit of a learning curve to use these new tools but it's 100 possible for people if you're willing to put in a few hours essentially thirdly once it's been built you're ready to give it to the client and start the reviewing process so I typically like to send a testing link as I can show you in a second what press actually makes it very easy to deploy this to a URL and you can send that URL to the client and they can give it a give it a test and really stress test it so tell the client to get in there and get their hands dirty and really stress test this thing figure out what works what doesn't and then give you a big document of feedback give you some screenshots as much information as you can I'd say avoid going back and forth back and forth back and forth on this just say hey give me one batch of iterations I'll work on it and then you can go back to them hey trade again and do sort of batches of iterations rather than constant communication or you're going to have a nightmare of once you have lots of clients on hand you're not going to be able to maintain that pace of communication back in bot press to quickly show you how that you can send this over to a client so it's super easy all you need to do is head to the Integrations book on web chat and then go to pre-configured and then you can copy this open up new tab and there you have it right there so this is the chatbot that you can start to use you can say hi and then it's working as properly here so we have the buttons down here and essentially you can go through the conversation once you've gone through the review process a few times maybe tweak the prompt on your stack AI side or you've tweaked the knowledge base Etc you've gotten it to the point where you're happy with it now you need to get into the deploying stage which is uh you're going to need to get them to create a bot press account once they've done this I need to add you as a collaborator this is all available on the FAQs and on their website once you're added as a collaborator then you're going to have an option pop-up in your dashboard that allows you to transfer it over to them and then once it's in there you can continue to do little tweaks for them but essentially it needs to be on their account so that you're not going to get billed for it and then sort of their responsibility after that then in order for them to actually be able to add it to their website or add it to whatever platform that you're trying to integrate this into you need to go back to the Integrations and see here you have all these different options again you're going to web chat pre-configured and then this script URL here is what you're going to take you can copy that and they can add that onto their website and it's going to pop up the same as this little thing down here a very very nice easy to use UI and it pops up like this so you can actually control the CSS installing of this that's sort of an advanced thing for another day but just know that this is how it's going to appear on the site and you can change it eventually if they want and with that you've serviced your very first AI automation agency client now of course it doesn't really count as an agency until you've hired people it on but you've done it as a freelancer and you've started to learn the skills the experience you need to become an AI automation expert and finally as promised I'm going to throw in this little bonus module of how to 5x your Revenue per customer using the exact methods that I use in my own business every day in order to five extra Revenue per customer you need to start doing upsells I know this might seem obvious to some of you guys but there is a little bit of a knack to it and foremost you need to start using chat Bots as the Trojan Horse to get into these businesses to earn their trust and then from there you have a great position to say I've proven that I'm an AI expert and I've helped you with this now let me analyze the rest of your business and identify other areas at this same technology can help or even easier upsell after something like this which is to go hey I've just provided you with this bot would you like an integration that's going to take these leads and connect them to this or do something with the the queries that you're getting to the custom knowledge base and let's just what do you want to set up an analysis system for the questions coming to the custom knowledge base and say how can we start to analyze the questions that are coming to the custom knowledge base categorizing them and figuring out what are the most common queries we're getting why are customers not able to find that information themselves on our website or in our email confirmations and things like that so really taking a deep dive into the business and then beyond these specific kinds of chat Bots that are outwards facing towards the customer what about internally do you have a bunch of content that's sitting around doing nothing that we could utilize to help your team generate more content like that so you really need to start to come into this as an AI automations expert and start to say we can do this we can do this we can do this and business owners want to save money business owners want to make more money so if you can tell them that you have a concrete way of doing that then they'll love you for it and the last two points here are really the gold standard of these AI automation agencies that we've started to move into as a company too which is to do full business Audits and workshops with companies and say we are going to come in we're going to analyze you from head to toe and figure out what you're good at what you're bad at and where AI could augment or even eliminate tasks completely once you have 10 to 20 of these different automations or deliverables that you can provide to the business it's a very easy sell to go to them and say it's obvious that we can help you in so many different ways then we can either scope and quote you on each and every one of these or we can save time on our end and save you money in the long run by working as partners and coming on as a monthly retainer and then before you know it you've got a couple clients paying you three to eight thousand dollars per month to come on and constantly work on their business to improve it with AI so that's the entire servicing process that myself and my team typically use now what you're probably looking to know next is how to sign your first AI automation client which is a video that is coming very soon as I said I'm working on the processes now and once I have that sorted out I'm going to be showing you guys firstly how to pick your AI automation agency Niche secondly how to find the potential customers within that Niche thirdly how to contact pitch and close those prospects and finally how to price your services at a fair rate and finally if you're looking for more information on AI automation

              "text": "this is going to be the second installment of my million dollar AI startup challenge where I'm in the process of building a AI business from scratch and taking it to a million dollars and documenting every step of the way and if you haven't already watched episode 1 it's going to be available up here click through that watch that so you know where we are with the challenge and what we're doing in this episode if you're new to the channel my name is Liam otley and I'm an online entrepreneur from New Zealand now based in Dubai but currently in Colombia I have my own AI development company and AI automation agency called Morningside AI where we help people build AI products and also automate their businesses where they are so we ended off the first episode of me putting a call out to all AI entrepreneurs out there aspiring or established entrepreneurs looking to create an AI business but maybe who didn't have the resources or the know-how to do it but had a bright idea and could potentially partner with me as a co-founder to come on and build something and create a valuable business fortunately the reception to that video was overwhelming and we had over 100 applications on the Google form that I dropped on my Discord and of this one I was only able to review about 50 of them before I had to cut the shortlist off and since you move into the next phase of the applications process so if you applied and I didn't get back to you my apologies but I will be contacting all of you and reaching out to connect on LinkedIn so we can have some sort of communication or at least stay in touch because I really want to thank you guys for making the effort to apply and make this challenge possible essentially and so the first task of this challenge was for me to go through all of these applications manually and just read every single one of them and get to know who you are and what your idea is so that alone was a very big task so I'm working my way through the co-founder proposals now we have had a ton of applications so got a lot of work ahead of me but once I've gone through all of these I'm gonna figure out who's the best and then shortlist a couple and then I'll start reaching out to them by email and start booking in the calls so hopefully it's on screen and then you'll see the interviews next so what I was doing is reading the entire application and doing a summary in my notion and doing a traffic light system on each so red yellow green and green being sort of perfect for the challenge and someone may have been put in yellow or even red if the idea was actually too big or it didn't fit the fit the requirements of the challenge so that was how I was able to organize into people who were ideal for the challenge and could sort of be an easy win for this kind of thing or people who were sort of dreaming too big for what I can deliver on this kind of challenge or what we can deliver within the scope of this challenge now the diversity and the quality of these applications is what really blew me away we had people from 16 years old to 60 we had people from authors to aerospace engineers we had all sorts of stuff in between as well so it was really incredible to see just how many people really showed up and the diversity and quality of this application so once I've taken everyone out of the Google form over to notion and applied the traffic light system I was able to shortlist about 15 to 20 people and then send emails to them asking to book on a call so the purpose of this call was to one get in front of them and start to see who they are as a person and do a bit of a character assessment on who they are and see if they'd be compatible with me see if I'd be interested in working with them in the first place and then secondly of course their idea what they were hoping to build and doing a couple probing questions into okay have you thought about how we can actually distribute this yeah it might be a great idea do you have any experience in the field do you have any connections that can make this easy to roll out so there were some very important questions not only on the marketing side but also have you thought about what an MVP looks like for this because me going in as the development partner or the development a side of this business technically I need to know how much time and energy I need to have a clear idea of what the MVP would need to be for us to be able to start taking this to customers and getting potentially starting to get money back and recouping some of their investment costs so having a clear idea of number one what is your MVP and and I can figure out internally how long that's going to take to build and how much it's going to cost and then secondly how do you plan to distribute this do you have a plan or you can expect me my team to figure that out as well so some very important questions there and I was note taken the whole time and science to piece together who the potential finalists could be hey guys so just getting started today for another day of interviews I've been talking to a bunch of different people yesterday did about five different interviews with people from the community I've got some really good ideas it's great to get face to face with some of these people and actually uh pick their brains to a little bit more exploration of the idea how they of uh how they plan to roll the idea out what's the marketing and distribution channels they have available to them and then also planning out some features and sort of what would this look like and how much work assistant require on the development end had a bunch of good conversations yesterday hoping for a bunch more today so I'm gonna get stuck into it now after all of these calls I was able to do a further round of analysis and figuring out okay if I boil this down even further distill it down to three finalists or two finalists who would they be and I got down to what I thought would be the best fit for the project in terms of the scope and requirements and how easy it would be to build this how easy it would be to get to that first sort of checkpoint of starting to get paid for the service so introducing our two finalists we have Robin and we have Constantine both of these guys made it to be finalists because they not only brought a lot of value with their idea and I thought the opportunity for both of them was great but as a person they bought a ton of energy and they bought a potentially really great business partner moving forward so that was a two sort of key criteria for me is that I liked the idea I saw the potential in it and secondly as a person I thought that I could get along with them and they brought enough human resources and human capital in themselves and potentially their connections as well to make this thing a sort of fair partnership and and have a chance of success now both co-founders brought a lot to the table and it was very difficult to actually choose between the two in the end we had to make a decision and out of respect for the person we didn't go with I'm not going to share their idea now some people go through this video and might want to reach out to them and get working on that idea but you're going to get to see the idea that we did go with shortly at the end of this video but you're not going to get to hear about the specifics of the other idea just out of respect for the guy who didn't get chosen but what we can do in this video is a high level analysis of the finalist as a person and also a high level analysis of their ideas firstly Constantine he sent in one of the best applications he actually bothered to send me a loom video rather than just typing a bit of information and there was actually something I mentioned in the form if you'd like to send me a loom you can send me a loom and him sending me that despite it being small you may think it's insignificant but a little things like that really stand out to me as going the extra mile and I think that's sort of a character trait not just a thing that happens by chance so that really stood out to me that he was the only one that bothered to send me a video like that at least in the ones that I looked at before the short listing secondly from the loom that he had sent over and from the cores that I've had with them up to this point I could tell that he was someone who I could get along with as a co-founder he was a young guy like myself very enthusiastic about starting something like this and I I could see myself getting along with him as a person and that's something that I was looking for in a co-founder thirdly he had experience working in the niche that we were intending to start in and he was able to analyze the opportunity the business idea by being in the mud essentially and figuring it out and seeing it firsthand that yes I know this is a problem because I've seen it firsthand so that's very important in validating the idea and it's important to have experience at least on one side because it wasn't something that I was experienced then so I needed my co-founder to know what he's talking about and know the industry inside out before we jump into anything and finally he'd actually had some experience working in a startup building his own and raising money for it so based on those things that was the sort of best character traits that made him stand out above the wrist and get him to this final stage his business idea was great for a number of reasons firstly it had a huge total addressable Market or Tam an enormous amount of potential customers and businesses that could apply it secondly it was B2B as I mentioned in the video that I would like to be building a B2B SAS rather than a b2c thirdly the industry and positioning of the business was not going to be in the sexiest area and I quite like businesses that are not in the sexy areas because there's less attention on them it's often the most boring and basic businesses that are making the most money behind the scene but even just never hear about them and you never even think of attacking that problem so that could mean less potential competitors for us and an easier ride long term and finally on the technology side we were not going to have to stretch the boundaries or explore the limitations and sort of edge use cases of AI this was a clear use case for AI that just hadn't been built out yet and hadn't been done in a major way and reached the mainstream yet so not being too experimental with the development side of things is also something I'm looking for now we can get on to our other finalist Robin who stood out to me for a number of reasons firstly he's actually unemployed right now and I know that may seem a little bit counter-intuitive but he's only unemployed because he is waiting to do his real estate exam so he's not unemployed I'd say he's idle right now so he's has a lot of time on his hands to be putting into the business and that was something that I was looking for in a co-founder because I need someone who has enough time and energy to be handling the day-to-day operations well I'm able to focus on the technology and the development side so big plus that he's gonna have a lot of time on his hands secondly something that struck me about Robin is that he is a very smart guy he has thought through everything he basically had an answer for every question he's had time to sit and think about this idea for a while so that brought a lot of confidence out in me and the business partner that this could potentially be a very good thing because he's had enough time to think about this idea and finally what's more a con than a pro is that there may be some kind of cultural or Communications mismatch between myself and him and any other team members he's based in Singapore and I'm sort of a Westerner so it could be a little bit of communication issues or just a mismatch of cultures that I'm not used to dealing with definitely something to be aware of when going into a partnership like this now Robin's idea was great for a number of reasons as well firstly it was going to be addressing a market of very wealthy individuals which is always a great thing to do secondly in my opinion and from my experience the application is using AI in a way that plays into the strength of the technology instead of forcing it to do things that it's not really meant to so plays into the strengths of the technology itself and finally it's in a small Niche that we could dominate if we did things right once I'd laid out all of the pros and cons up against each other I had quite clearly a very very difficult decision to make I actually hopped on another round of calls with each of the finalists but this time with my business partner and Mentor Josh he is an absolutely killer online entrepreneur and a trust and respect his opinion immensely so getting him on these calls was very important for me to get some feedback from him and he's also going to be a business partner and handling sort of the marketing and also overseeing some of the operations on the development side of things so he's going to be very involved it was important to get his opinion on both sides hey guys we just got off calls with the finalists so we had calls with uh the two finalists that we've narrowed it down to and now we are I'm just going to hop on a call with my business partner Josh now and have a chat to him he was on the calls I want to get his thoughts on the two fighters we have and uh I mean what he thinks I got about my own opinions and uh um I'll probably need to have a think over the next while but I want to have a call with him so you'll see that now hey mate after those two guys we've just spoken to what are your thoughts I know I've definitely got my my opinions on it but I want to see where you're sitting what do you think of firstly of uh of concertina fesco yes I think he has some great experience in terms of obviously raising money before I think he has a fantastic work ethic uh and he's very aware of obviously how to develop platforms like this looking at that uh board that he put through um of the sigma it's extremely extremely detailed and I like how much authorities put into my only concern would be when obviously we're going into these Consultants there is going to have to be a heck of a lot of work done you know at your feet on the ground obviously going under me with these guys and getting those things sold and I think he's a very smart dude with a lot of other priorities that could potentially hinder the growth and how quickly we want to move on something like this I just don't know if he has the availability to really put in as much time as what we're looking for and you look at Robin the situation that he's in I think aligns a lot more with the objectives that we're trying to try to achieve here yeah no I think um for those of you I'm not sure if we'll show it in the clip but um Robin is is doing his training for us into real estate uh real estate agents at the moment so he has basically all day every day to be working on this so I think that could work out pretty well so I think worth doing maybe another call with Robin just to not necessarily confirm it but just take another step down that that path um as much as I love concertina love his energy he's um it'd be good to good to potentially get something going with him at some point but I think in terms of the the opportunity and the scope of this project could be best to explore a little bit more of the robin right yeah I think the other thing that I really love about Robin is there's potentially two components to that business right and it's something that me and you have spoken about for the past couple of months is building out platforms on the back of these things um and I think that his caves perfectly to that I think we were having discussions for the last couple of months of building something like that anyway at some point I think integrating it obviously into the real estate Niche aligns perfectly with being able to essentially test uh sort of these ad platforms running off the back of these llms and like we discussed previously I think you could even create a separate entity out of that whereas You Know You're Building uh you know ad platforms and allowing llms to integrate with bad platforms and monetize um off the back of these things so I really like that option as well and like you said he sounds like he's got a lot of time on his hands right now which is exactly what we need when we're trying to move as fast as possible yeah I think um well the the market size I think with the consultancy it's such a gigantic industry and it would really take time to really really Corner the market there but for the purpose of this challenge I think going for more Niche and more uh sort of specific on the challenge side of things could be better and sort of easier easier to see that we've succeeded and sort of crushed the market all right I'll uh I'll get a get another call book done I appreciate your time around and helping out with that I'll um I'll get another one booked in with us and hopefully we can move towards what's getting something wrapped up see you later after speaking with Josh it was time to come to a decision and in the end we ended up choosing Robin we just felt like for the purposes of the project it would fit the bill a little bit better I think a smaller Niche could potentially be good to be able to go on a dominate a market and he has a lot of time on his hands has the connections to get this thing up and running quickly so it was more a good versus great comparison I really really hope someone gets in touch with Constantine I'll be leaving his details somewhere down below so you guys can get in touch with him but his idea was really great and I hope one of you guys who's more technical can reach out to him and partner with them and get that thing built up because I'll be pretty jealous this decision between the finalists and really most of the shortlist that I spoke to is a case of Good vs great and I think a lot of the people who made it to the shortlist had really really good ideas it was just a case of for the purposes of this project for the purposes of a million dollar challenge what is going to make this the easiest and what is going to suit what we're after the most so Robin's idea and Robin as a co-founder we felt fit the bill the best he's going to have a lot of time to work on it and really help us out on the operation side he had the connections to get this thing off the ground very very quickly and some really really bright ideas about how we can do that so I sort of ticked all the boxes for us and we're really really excited to get moving forward and now you know who the co-founder is I can tell you a bit about the business I asked Robin to whip together a quick presentation to show you guys so we'll be jumping into that now I'm proud to say that we are going to be building an AI real estate advisor for the Singaporean market so we can jump into the presentation here by Robin Singapore real estate AI advisor problems laws and regulations procedures tax and fees too much info property agents Etc so to give you a high level overview of the Singaporean real estate market and some of the problems that we're going to be addressing within it basically say I'm a investor or an expat looking to invest in Singapore if I want to know where I can invest and when and how much and basically the specifics is a lot of rules and red tape around different areas and different regulations what we're going to do is make that all very very simple through a chat bot so it's going to be addressing the laws and regulations here the tax and fees and as it says here there's two too much info being thrown at people and they essentially have to be going through someone like a Property agent or another person and pay them to guide them through the process of buying a property they want we're going to be simplifying all of that down into a chatbot that people can come on to as potential investors and ask a couple questions or be asked some questions and really get the information they need in a very pain-free and hassle-free way so it's going to be a llm-powered application that has access via Vector databases to the relevant information to solve user queries so a little bit of information on the market size we have 34 000 plus agents 25 of those are active at any one time and they're spending up to 2 000 Singaporean dollars per month on Advertising so what we're going to be doing is tapping into that advertising spend and saying hey instead of spending it over there why don't you send it our way we have this new platform where people are coming to ask questions we can get you in front of these people if you pay us some of your juicy marketing dollars Robin's done a very quick competitive analysis here we have some companies that I assume are based out of Singapore and we also have chat gbt and open AI themselves like potential one day enable this within their own system so there is a slight risk of that but I think in the near term we're going to be fine on that front obviously the main value proposition of this is that you're going to be saving so much time and effort and potentially not even forking over money to other people who would typically tell you how to invest in Singapore the people you'd normally go to and also there's an added benefit of we're going to be pairing people up and suggesting real estate agents that people can get in touch with that are specialized to the area so it's a personalization service that's going to allow you to better connect potential clients with the real estate agents and a mutually beneficial relationship if the real estate agent is high quality and if the client has money to spend so with doing matchmaking for real estate agents and potential investors now I hope that gave you a quick understand of what we're trying to build and why but at this point it's not done yet the deal has not been cut so we had another couple of meetings with Robin we're going over the details of finer details of the deal structure our responsibilities as a development company and business partner and his responsibilities as a co-founder in this business as well shooting down to the Cafe and uh sunny day and uh I'm gonna go down do some work at the cafe really nice quality some good food so silence very nice around here but final stages of the calls and final stages of these the challenge so we're looking forward to getting that that wrapped up in the next next couple of days and should be able to start on development very soon so we're just finishing off the contract finishing off the the details I would essentially um and then being able to move forward so aside from that we've got some interesting stuff going on with the development agency interesting stuff going there so um wrapping up my time here in Colombia soon but I've really enjoyed it and I think I'll be back soon so encounter Colombia if you uh if you're from Colombia it's a beautiful place but have a marathon in a few days here is the Cafe Cafe Dragon it's a nice spot so I'm gonna get some work done in here and see you soon with those last meetings out of the way and the pie defeat up appropriately and the MVP Vision sort of clarified and what we're moving towards with the first stage of development we were done we're ready to get started so I want to know what you guys think are you bullish on our fledging startup or can you poke holes in our logic and our idea either way I want to hear it down in the comments below please hit down below I want to hear your opinion and some of you guys are probably experts in giving fields and can give a bit of a great advice to us before we start on this journey so any of that would be great just head down to the comments below and leave that down there so thank you so much to everyone who applied I'm really sorry that I couldn't get to work with more of you but I know that with the quality of the ideas that I'd received and gone through my applications there's so many of you who can benefit hopping into my community Discord and sort of a place where Technical and non-technical Founders are rubbing shoulders are like a matchmaking service for co-founders in there so if you have your idea and you haven't yet moved on it please head into the Discord please have a chat to some people and start knocking on doors essentially and say I have a great idea who's coming with me that's all for this episode guys thank you so much for watching and the next episode we're going to be launching our MVP so if you don't want to miss that be sure to

various AI income streams and breaking down the revenue and profit numbers to give you guys an idea of where my money comes from and how much and then also more importantly sharing with you guys what I did differently over the past 30 days the edits I made sort of the pivots I made within my businesses that got me to this number and increased my profit margins and more importantly how you guys can take what I've done and the lessons that I've learned in this journey and apply it to set you replicate the businesses that I've created and how you can start to build your own AI businesses and scale them up to these numbers as well I'm really excited to be sharing this with you guys because I think what I've done in this recent pivot is actually tapping into a new and unaddressed Market that anyone can really set up a business and start addressing so I'm going to be showing you later in the video how I plan to scale to 100K per month from where I am now and then also how you guys can get started and what I believe is the easiest way to 10K per month as an entrepreneur who wants to get into AI using the exact thing that I've been tapping into over this past 30 days more on all of that at the end of the video so if you're new to the channel and don't know who I am my name is Liam otley and I'm an online entrepreneur I run my own AI development company called Morningside AI we build AI software for clients varying from Custom chat Bots to content creation system all sorts of things I'm based in Dubai but at the moment I am in beautiful Medellin Colombia out here for a couple more weeks and with all of that out of the way we can jump into the presentation so what I learned making forty five thousand dollars profit in 30 days with AI so there's a table of contents we're going to be going over firstly my AI income streams secondly the pros and cons of each and what I'd recommend for you guys and thirdly my plan to scale from where I am now to 100 000 profit per month the types of changes that I'm going to be making things I'm going to drop things I'm going to spend more time on and finally the easiest way to 10K per month for beginners from my perspective if I was to start again and I was in your position with potentially no skills or no money and you're looking to start an AI business then this is how I would do it myself so that's going to be at the end of the video make sure you stick around because it's really really exciting stuff so firstly going over my income streams what we can do is hop over to my strides this is a bit of goal tracking that I do just to sort of keep me on the ball in terms of where I want to be so as you can see I have my total AI Revenue which I'm aiming for one million dollars by the end of the year for my various companies my consultancy Etc we are not on Pace at the moment but that's kind of how I like to keep it we've done about 200 000 total and that breaks down into my Morningside AI Revenue which is my high ticket development company I've done about 185 000 so far YouTube income is about six thousand seven hundred so far I think there's a little bit not accounted for there and then my consultancy income as well I've done about 11 nearly twelve thousand dollars this year so far so for that I'm aiming for about 50K by the end of the year YouTube income also 50k and Morningside AI I'm going for 500 and overall we're going for 1 million in Revenue so that's a quick breakdown of where I am with my goals and the kind of numbers that I've done from the different aspects and now we can jump into the slideshow and you can see a bit of a breakdown of each so first of all as you can probably tell oh I do have a YouTube channel and that is bringing in some money through AdSense so nothing major here just it's nice to be getting paid essentially to to make videos for you guys and compensating me for my time so I have a few expenses here in terms of editors and thumbnails but we're making about three thousand dollars this past month and that up 30 from last month so first income stream is YouTube making me about three thousand dollars in the past 30 days secondly I have my AI consulting services and now this is pure profit thankfully I mean there's a little bit of stripe taking a cut there but I didn't bother including that in there because it's so small but I did about 20 calls in the last 30 days so that's about six thousand dollars of pure profit and that's up 15 on the month so consultancy a really great way to get in touch with new clients and basically have conversations with cool people and potentially sell them on my AI development services so speaking of AI development services I have my high tech and AI development which I'm sort of splitting it into high ticket and low ticket as you'll see in the next slide sort of a little bit different and and operates in in very different ways and I'm sort of more excited about the low ticket side of things at the moment so I have my own company as I mentioned Morningside AI we did about fifty four thousand dollars in the past 30 days and that was at a not so great profit margin as you can see but we're still making about twenty thousand dollars in the past 30 days so obviously expenses and here are going to be my developers my operations people managers Etc so month-to-month increase of about 31 there now finally we get to the most interesting part of this whole breakdown which is what I'm terming the AI automation agency or AI automation aspect of my development company and this is the low ticket development client and as for my high ticket development there's typically sort of 10 to 20 to 30 000 per client large clients that require very very specialized developers Etc I'll get onto the pros and cons of each in a second but just a quick rundown of it so what is an AI automation agency and how does it differ from my high ticket clients and high ticket development services with Morningside AI the key difference between these two and the reason that the profit margin is so much higher on the the AI automation agency client is because of how you can service these clients now I'm going to get into this more as we go through so I'm just going to give us a quick rundown twenty six thousand dollars in Revenue a nice much lower expenses of 9900 and the profit of Sixteen thousand and ninety two with a month over month increase of 530 this is what has contributed the most to the growth of the business and our profit over the past 30 days so this is really the interesting part that I want to bring the attention to now on the right here is actually a little hint of how you can service these AI automation clients but more on that later now here's a quick breakdown of everything a quick summary we have the sources Revenue profit the margin the time spent and difficulty so as you can see the high ticket development has low margins takes up a lot of time and is actually quite hard to service we have things like Consulting that are very easy and the AI automation side of the agency is pulling in a much juicier profit margin and it's actually taking up less time per week that number is actually due to come down in terms of time spent because of the highest that I'm able to make within the next 30 days and if I've done my maths right the final profit comes down to about forty five thousand two hundred and three dollars now jumping into the pros and cons I'm going to go quick fire through each of these give a quick rundown of what's good about them what's bad about them and whether I'd recommend you guys to look into building it as an income stream for yourself so YouTube we've got a profit of three thousand dollars the pros that it's semi passive ones created once I create a video it's up there and can sort of make me money forever it could pick up and get millions of views out of that a lot so it's semi passive once you've done the work you can leave it there forever secondly I'm getting paid to generate leads and awareness for my own personal brand so it's nice to be actually getting paid I'm getting enough benefit from YouTube through the leads and through the Consulting but I'm actually getting paid from YouTube to build my personal brand and to generate leads so it's kind of a win-win and of course it compounds over time my personal brand is going to continue to build more subscribers Etc more awareness finally the cons can be quite time intensive of being a YouTuber can be a full-time job if you're doing it right so it's very time intensive to continually be making new videos looking out writing scripts Etc and secondly the US somehow still is able to take like 30 of my earnings from us viewers so that bugs me a little bit considering I'm based myself in Dubai so that I can get away from taxes but yeah anyway secondly Consulting we've got a nice profit of six thousand dollars the pros is that by this 300 per 45 minute cap that I have on my Consulting it actually qualifies people before they even get to me so instead of people coming to me with hey I have this great idea have a talk to me basically only the people with 300 to spend and who are really eager to speak to me are going to make it through that sort of first qualification checkpoint so I do like that about the Consulting and that leads to sort of a 75 of calls leading to development inquiries with people wanting to build something with me and of course 100 margins because it's trading my time for for their money essentially now the cons is that it's obviously not that scalable because it's sort of directly tied to my time and it can break up my day if I'm trying to get a big workbook in and then someone books a call right in the middle I like to be as flexible as I can for people but sometimes it does interrupt the workflow so high ticket AI development with Morningside AI our profit was around twenty thousand dollars as mentioned the pros here is that the average aov is around fifteen thousand dollars so that's a nice high ticket High ticket product we're selling a lot of the time build some good case studies in terms of clients we've worked with and adds credibility to myself and the company and it's also great networking you meet some interesting people these guys with a lot of money to spend who are wanting to start a startup and potentially want to bring us on as partners which there's a whole bunch of great things that come from that if you're able to successfully service a client onto the cons it's actually very difficult to scope projects for these larger high ticket development clients because it's so experimental in a lot of cases when clients want to build some Cutting Edge AI technology that's never been done before it's not like a web development company where the agency owner could tell you within the nearest hundred how much that website is going to cost it's hard to scope and hard to actually nail down how much this is going to cost and ensure that we're getting covered enough and we've got a safety buffer and the client's also not being ripped off so it's a very very difficult to scope them because of this we tend to waste a lot of time on proposals for clients who can't actually afford the more expensive AI development services because it's not cheap to get custom things built out right now purely because the talent is in such demand and the price of AI Engineers is quite high low margins and we said before and it's actually as I said very hard to find adequate Talent so it's a very dry Market I've been fortunate enough to get some new highs recently which has allowed us to take more people on but still very very hard to find people who are real and know what they're doing and have experience on the stuff that's been around for a few months really and finally the AI automation side of things which is around sixteen thousand dollars worth of profit now before I go into the pros and cons I should probably explain what I mean by AI automation clients and how I'm distinguishing that from the high-tech clients that I service normally through Morningside AI key distinction here is that you don't need to build out an entirely custom coded solution for every one of these clients this allows you to essentially template it use low code or no code bot Builders or content generation systems zapier all these different things it's essentially taking it down from this custom bespoke solution that needs really high quality developers and bringing it down to okay let's make it use the existing tools maybe the client doesn't want an entirely bespoke solution they don't mind if it's done via a sort of no code a low code Builder let's actually use these chatbot builders that have been popping off everywhere and start to service them and give them a bit of experience I actually figured this AI automation model out by taking a look at all of these leads that we were saying no to on and Morningside AI that was sub 5K that we turn away because they're just not worth our time after all the meetings Etc and I thought okay there's so much money we're letting out the door here how could we service these in a way that's cost effective efficient and benefits to clients and ideally doesn't involve me so much I don't have to get on all these calls neither does my business partner so that's actually where this came from and the way you service these clients is by using pre-made like bot building tools rather than creating a custom solution so in order to build a custom solution you need expensive devs you need a good scoping process and proposal process very long very weighty in terms of the admin Etc with this AI automation side of things you're dealing with clients who need a quick little job done to be able to use bot Builders like bot press and stack Dash AI to build these things up and you can deploy them on their website very quickly very easy so so more on that later I will go into a bit more in terms of the how to start your first business and get the 10K per month and go to go more on more depth there but that's basically AI Automation in a nutshell we have minimal admin as I mentioned I don't have to get on all these calls I'm actually able to pass it to my business partner or my head of operations who's able to handle all these calls without me needing to be on their High ticket clients obviously want me to hop on and say hi to them and be present on the call these guys don't mind they just want their things built out and they want it done for a good price so easy to scope we know how much to build this chatbot for a very very basic implementation and basic requirements for each project easier to find talent because you're using no code bot Builders like bot press and stack Dash AI you don't need to have a 10 years experience software engineer who's now recently specialized in AI That's charging 70 plus an hour so you can find basically anyone I've been teaching my friends how to do this and how to service these clients uh anyone with half a brain can figure out how to use these bot Builders if they give it enough time and follow the right training essentially and of course by doing that the talent is actually cheaper the talent is not going to cost as much maybe half the price or more fast delivery these are very quick turnaround projects less than one week typically very easy upselling because you use these chat Bots and sort of customer support chat Bots as a trojan horse to get you in and then people will go oh well I'd actually like to get this this and this building so you just continue to build them on more and more of these small little parts to improve their business and I'm going to do a deeper dive on this business model at another time so if you want more information on it be sure to subscribe because I I do want to do a full breakdown of this business and how I've been overrunning it and finally we have higher margin so as you can see back here the margins on my AI automation clients in the past 30 days was around 60 I actually expect that to increase further because I'm bringing on people full time in the near future and that is going to bring things down drastically it's going to also bring down the time I've spent on it drastically so margins are going to go up time is going to go down and this is just going to get sweeter and sweeter the better the systems I I built in so that's really the the magic Behind These lower ticket at clients is that you can systemize it far better because the ticket size is smaller the average order value is smaller it's less pressure it's more straightforward development You Can Build a Better Business around this because the high ticket development clients are specialized for every single proposal every single project requires a lot of oversight but these are basic they're straightforward and you can take on a lot of them at once now for the cons of the AI automation agency it is technically on paper lower ticket and you have to do more of them to make the same amount of money but I think that could almost more be put into the pro side of things because for the reasons I just stated easier to service it's less complex easier to scope and finally you're constrained by these no code or low code bot building platforms that you're creating so the functionality can only go up to a certain level before you're sort of capped by the platform when you have to bus out into a custom solution so those are the pros and cons I know it's a bit long-winded but I really really think you guys need to soak this up and I'm about to show you guys exactly how I would do this and how I'd start one from 0 to 10K in a second so how am I planning to scale this weigh 100K per month business now firstly I'm going to expand the AI automation team I'm not one who's afraid of pivoting when he sees a good opportunity so I'm going to be changing my resources and sort of bringing on more people and allocating my resources towards this AI automation side of thing rather than the high ticket development side of things before Morningside AI so to do this I'm going to be sampling people of different skill sets and sort of hourly rates and seeing if I can train them up so ideally I could get someone who cost ten dollars an hour and train them up on how to build these but I'm sort of slowly working down and saying okay this guy costs 30 per hour can I get them to build these Bots for my clients and if so I'm going to keep moving that down and expanding the team filling it out with more people who are costing less I'm actually in the process of hiring someone to come and work full time for my AI automation team and they should be able to service 20 to 30 of these clients in a month if we're able to give them enough leads so you do the mouse on that that's a lot of money coming in from just one employee and if the profit margins continue to be good then we're definitely pushing towards that 100K per month Mark so beyond that that I'm going to be expanding the service offering as I said there's so many different things you use chat Bots use content generation systems as a trojan horse to get you in the door with different clients and then once you're in there's so many different ways you can like zapier flows content generation system Etc there's so many different things that you can build and especially within different Industries it varies so we're sort of expanding and exploring different products that we can start to sell once we are in the door and finally we're going to be doing something that I've never really had to do but we've been doing recently which is to scale up our lead generation and cold Outreach now for some of the clients that we've been able to service for the automation side of things in the past 30 days some of those actually came through our own lead generation because I wanted to not do it all through my personal brand I wanted to see can I actually generate this through through lead generation and cold Outreach and the answer is yes we've been able to do it on a small scale but I'm going to get my business partner who also has a marketing agency to really drill down and and figure out how we can generate more leads through cold Outreach and and sign more clients so that that new personal hide has constantly got work and then if we get a scalable system we can continue to hire more people on build up the team and then we just need to increase the ad spend and increase the the highs we have essentially so between all of those different strategies I think we're going to be able to push to this 100 000 per month Mark within the next few months I will keep you guys updated on it but now what you've all been waiting for which is more important than me talking about my my business and how much money I'm making which is what is the easiest way to 10K per month for beginners from what I've learned in the past 30 days what I believe to be the easiest way to 10K per month as a beginner is to create your own AI automation agency as I've explained in this video which is servicing smaller clients who need basic chatbot functionality content generation system AI automations zapier flows Etc I'm going to be doing a video on the full deliverables that I'm currently serving I know you may not be able to fully comprehend exactly what I'm talking about here but just know that this opportunity is real and I really really think that this is the opportunity you've all been waiting for and terms of AI business models which is you don't need skills because you're able to hire Freelancers to do the work for you all you need is a high level understanding of their kind of services that you can provide and how they come together secondly the zero startup cost because this is a service based business you only get need to Dish money out as soon as you've got money in so you assign the client they pay you then you can start delivering the service and hiring and paying your employees Etc so thirdly this is an untapped Market we are in the start of a a new world in the same way that the internet had to sort of take 10 to 20 years for Brick and Mortar businesses to adapt websites and for all the productivity gains of the internet to trickle down and the World Wide Web to trickle down through the entire economy we now have a time where every business on the planet pretty much can Implement some sort of AI functionality to improve their productivity and to improve their business and stay ahead of the competitions everyone's also scared about it so it's not a hard sell either so imagine every business on the planet could do with some of these Services there's not many people basically no one who knows how to service them so that's why this is the biggest opportunity right now and why you need to move on this as soon as possible and finally these sort of nail in the coffin for me on why this is so good is that it has high margins I've been running the high ticket side of Morningside AI for six to six to eight months now and it was just sort of a bashing my head against the ball sometimes I'd go through so much effort and the profit margin would be like 30 or something and it's just crippling when you've done so much work and you've been on so many calls and you've managed projects for you to get 30 of your money out of that so for these four reasons I believe that this is the opportunity for many of you guys and I'm going to be doing a ton more content on it and I'm going to be explaining what I'm doing how I'm running it and likely be sharing some more information within my Discord and talking to some of you guys in the Discord about how you can actually get started and maybe taking on a couple of you guys as case studies so that I can start to share results that I'm getting now that's all the information I can jam into this video guys that's probably already way too long and I'm sorry if I've dragged things on here but as you can tell I'm really excited about this I've had a great month with me and my team over the past 30 days and we've stumbled across something that I believe solved all the problems in my head that were like how can I scale this AI software development agency when everything is so difficult everything's so custom and bespoke but using these no Code and low code bot Builders and AI system creation tools you can scale this much more aggressively you don't have to be as involved it's more profitable that everything is just pointing towards this so be sure to subscribe to my channel to stay up to date on the latest information regarding this business model also be sure to head down and subscribe to my newsletter in the description I'm going to be sharing more information and sort of gems on this exact business model and what I've been doing and how I've been servicing these clients that's going to be available in the description so subscribe to that if you want to talk to myself you want to talk to my community and any other guys who are in the space doing the same sort of things be sure to join my Discord and start having a chat about it in there I'd love to speak to you guys and get your thoughts and answer any questions you guys have

              "text": "in front of us this example of the four functions that the chatbot can do all from within the same UI so here we have a regular query being answered as if it's chat gbt here we have a business related question querying a homozy database here we have a stock related question querying a Warren Buffett knowledge base and finally we have a entrepreneurial based question answering that question from a Richard Branson knowledge base so all four all in the same place but intelligently relating to the relevant databases in this video I'm going to be showing you how to create a hybrid custom mods chatbot that can not only answer user queries on your custom mod space but can also answer and serve as a regular purpose chatbot similar to chat gbt by setting up a system that can intelligently route the queries based on what the user is needing to do so if it's a question about your custom knowledge base the query will go to the custom knowledge base if it isn't related to your custom knowledge base it will be relative to the chat GPT API or gpt4 whatever you want so firstly I'm going to be breaking down how these systems work and how you're able to have multiple different data types attached to a bot and essentially send the queries to them only when it's relevant so this is how you create really flexible and multi-purpose Bots with tons of different data that's intelligent enough to know what the user is asking for and where if you're new to the channel my name is Lee Motley and I help entrepreneurs wrap their heads around AI by giving you simple and easy to understand tutorials breaking down the complex Concepts down to this simplest form and if you haven't already subscribed to my AI newsletter or join my AI entrepreneurship Discord you can get those links in the description so the example app that I'm going to be using to illustrate how these systems work is called MBA GPT and it's something that I whipped up for the purposes of this video that I thought you guys might find interesting and maybe give me some ideas about how you could actually apply this technology to your business and to your personal life now the idea behind this app is to be able to connect multiple different data sources or in this case Vector databases filled with information so in this case I've taken Alex from Ozzy Warren Buffett and Richard Branson and I've found the content online from PDFs Etc on all three of these guys so that I have a ton of information to sort of make up some kind of knowledge base for each of them and then what I want to do is connect all three of the knowledge bases into the app and allow the app to essentially route the query depending on what the user is asking so if I'm asking something about business I've told it to Route it to the Alexa mozzie database so get all those information on how to scale online businesses Etc and use that to answer the question but if the user is asking about investing then it's going to be routed to the Warren Buffett custom knowledge base and look for any similar things within the database there and bring that back and answer it and then finally anything related to entrepreneurship and the lifestyle side of things and and who you want to be as an entrepreneur is going to be relative to the Richard Branson side so the key thing here is that the chatbot is going to be able to intelligently route the user's query to the database that has the information relevant to get that answer so investing for Warren Buffett business for Alex Modi and Entrepreneurship for Richard Branson and the final nail in the coffin here is that if the query is not related to business investing or entrepreneurship it is then going to be relative to the chat EBT API and treat it as a regular question so if you're asking something like what color is the sky or what color is the C it's going going to go this isn't about investing this isn't about business this isn't about entrepreneurship we're going to classify this as other and let's route that to the chair GPT API and get an answer so in this way the chat bot and how you're able to use it is going to be super super flexible and that anything that doesn't match what we have information on in the vector databases can just be sent to the chat GPT API and answered as a regular question so that's a lot out of the way but that's how these apps work and I'm going to jump in and show you an example of it now so first things first I needed to get them information on all of these guys in order to use to create a custom knowledge base that we can then query so you can see on the left here I've got a docs folder and it has Branson and it has a buffet folder Richard Branson I found some stuff on the internet all sorts of things most of these are actually not written by him but in the case of Warren Buffett we have some letters to investors that have been compiled all sorts of things in Berkshire Hathaway really really good stuff of all of his investment a philosophy and and how he likes to go about investing so here's all the information I have two PDFs on each of them and then for Alexa mozzie I've already done all of this sort of they data collection and putting into a database so if you haven't seen my Alexa multi 500 chatting to podcast video where I essentially create an AI version of him that's going to be available up here if you want to watch that but essentially I already have that playing Vector database set up and ready to go with I think at the 163 different our customers put in there so that I can just plug straight into this app and I don't actually need to ingest anything to create the Buffett and Brands and indexes I just have this indexing.pi file which is essentially using a lang chain and it's going to be creating a chroma DB out of each of them and saving it to this DB folder so that's all done here I can just run the script once and then it's going to save it and then I don't have to do it ever again I can just load them each time instead of having to recreate them now I went to the app.pi file you can see where most of the magic is actually happening so what we have set up here is actually called an intent classifier now Lang chain has a similar thing to this in terms of their tools but this is sort of a straight to the point way of doing it without using all these libraries you can essentially just use language models to to set up your own intent classifier and have a little bit more control over it so I prefer to use this setup currently but what we have here is the XT Delta text input so the text input is on the chatbot when people type something in and when they submit it this is what's going to be triggered so this generate response function is up here as in the Alex mozzie bot so this is where all the magic is happening as soon as the user's message comes in we send it straight to this intent classifier function which is here at our utils.pi now this may look a little bit complex but essentially all we're doing is using a open AI chat completion using the 3.5 turbo model and we're essentially using the GPT 3.5 turbo to classify what the user is asking for so here you can see it's using this prompt and it's actually replacing the prompt with what the user sent so in our prompts file we have the prompt here now this is what I'm calling a classification prompt we do a bit of role prompting here Etc same sort of stuff but the real magic is here where I say your task is as follows your analyze user inputs and classify each input into four different categories four categories of business question investing question entrepreneur question or other if you can't tell what it is say other so here we have of category is business question output 0 investing question one entrepreneur question two other three Etc so these are the three categories Alex and Aussie four business question Buffett for investing question and uh Richard Branson for entrepreneur question and other is just sending it to the chat GPT API so here we do a little bit of a shop prompting as I'm sure you're familiar with if you've watched my other videos I generated all of these with chat gbt I just said give me some examples of prompts that are related to business and put it in this format so this is essentially some examples of how it should deal with it and how it should output and then we have user input and prompt so that takes us back to here which is where we're going to be taking the user prompt from what they've just sent in put it into the intent classifier function replace that prompt with what the prompt is it might be can you write me a plan about diversifying my portfolio so that it's for an inflationary environment or something so what this is going to do is send that prompt off with their sort of insertion and then what we're going to get back is a number that we can then use going back to our app.pi file up here and pass to the route by category function so here it's going to the intent classifier Returns the number that we get from the big prompt that we sent off and that number is then going to be passed into this route by category function so essentially we figure out what category it is and then we route them to different handlers so these are Handler functions up here and each one of these handles essentially what the user query is and gives us back what we need for that specific I guess custom knowledge base that we're sending it off to so if it's related to business it's going to be routed to this homology Handler it's going to query the homozy database and give back a bunch of information from that database and Etc if it's related to investing it's going to be sent to the buffer Handler and if it's related to entrepreneurship it's going to be sent to the Branson Handler and finally the other Handler is here now what happens after the Handler functions have returned their information gets a little bit more messy but I won't take you through that now I'll just show you this in action and show you how we are actually routing to the correct Vector database that we want to query and how this looks in action so we can run stream alert run app dot Pi so here we have the app running NBA GPT chatting with multiple data sources now I've brought it up like this because I want you guys to watch the terminal carefully here because when I put a query in it it's going to take it through that intent classification process and it's going to print out where it's being sent to so you can see for each of these Handler functions it will print using the buffet Handler print using the brands and handle Etc so we're going to be able to see if this is working correctly so how can I increase aov from an e-commerce business and then bam using the homozy Handler so it's working correctly now we need to wait for it to get that information back and then create the answer since you need to generate it from the information it's pulling so let's see what it says and see here we can see we've gotten an answer back from the homology Handler it's actually referencing some of the different podcast episodes that it's being pulled from which is helpful sometimes helpful not but this is an example of the homozy Handler being used correctly and this time we can test out the buffered Handler by asking a question about investing so we can say how can I referred into the market and here we have using the Buffett Handler so it's correctly identified it as a investing relating question or we can even ask something more specific to Warren's skill set on his own personal opinions how do you evaluate a stop using the buffet Handler and it's answering Ed Warren Buffett would ask yourself if the company is easily understandable good solid history all those regular stuff that came out of the letter to investors that have been put into the vector database this is pulling from and now I guess the final example that we can do is entrepreneurial based questions so how can I vote with a full life as using Branson Handler to live a fulfilling life as an entrepreneur you need to do what excites you and brings you Joy as Richard regins suggests don't just think about the cost or speed of your business but focus on creating something amazing and valuable so this is all pulling from the Crypt databases when we query it so the intend classify system is working correctly and then there's only one last thing to do which is to ask it a generic question that isn't related to either of the databases or any of the databases sorry and we can say what color is the ocean and it says using other Handler down the bottom so we're correctly identify buying it as a other based question and here we have the ocean often absorbs blue reflects something like that a lot of that so what we have here is a custom mods chatbot that can intelligently route queries to the relevant database so that it can get specific knowledge applied to the question so we have Warren Buffett for investing our looks from Aussie for business and Richard Branson for entrepreneurial advice all of these is essentially like sprinkles on top of chat gbt because now any query that comes in that's regular can be sent to the church CPT API but with augmented chat gbt by giving it these different custom knowledge bases in different areas with the specific knowledge of the different grades in respective field so I think it's really cool that you can do this and I hope you guys got something out of this I'll be sharing this code if you want to steal it off my GitHub you can check that out in the description but I'm sure you guys have a bunch of interesting use cases for this kind of stuff within your own businesses if you can get in touch with me as a consultant or get in touch with my development company if you'd like to build something out with us we do these sort of projects all the time and I thought I'd give you guys an example so that you can visualize it and sort of get an idea of what's possible with these tools at the moment so that's about it for the video guys thank you so much for watching if you haven't already signed up to my AI newsletter in the description also my AI entrepreneurship Discord they're down there too so if you want to watch any more videos they'll be here here and in the next slide but thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

              "text": "in this video we're going to be checking out private gbt which is an open source project on GitHub that has been blowing up recently because it allows you to chat to your document but 100 offline that's right what I'm about to show you can be done completely offline because it uses local language models on your machine or on your laptop so that you can have a hundred percent private conversations with your documents without ever sending it off to open AI or any other company the reason this GitHub repo is blowing up right now is because of how simple it makes it to install and ingest your own documents into a custom knowledge base and start chatting with them with local models in a matter of minutes so within this super quick tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to download and install private gbt onto your own machine ingest your documents and then start chatting with them in just a few minutes but before we get started if you haven't already signed it to my AI newsletter called the drip we're giving you the condensed version of all the hottest AI news delivered direct to your inbox every few days so be sure to hit down below in the description in the pin comment if you can sign up to my AI newsletter if you haven't done that already so before you actually get into to installing it on your machine let's take a quick look at the GitHub repo you're going to be available to grab this link in the description but here we can see private GPT allows us to ask questions on your documents without an internet connection using the power of llms 100 private no data leaves your execution environment at any point you can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection now some of you have been getting bombarded with questions about local models and writing things locally so I think this is going to make a lot of you very very happy so let's have a dive into a few examples that it says here so the example it gives us here is why was NATO created Etc built using Lang chain and GPT for all if you haven't already seen my other GPT for all video it's going to be like here or here I always get it wrong but basically they make it super simple for us to set this up we're going to need to download the entire repo then we just can install all the required dependencies using this requirements.txt file now one of the best parts about this repo in my opinion is that it has direct download links to the models that you need to use so you need to click on both of these you can download them here if you click on it going to allow you to download both of these models these are absolutely required it can't work without downloading them so make sure you click on both of these and get them downloading here I've already got them downloaded so I don't have to do that just now and another thing that makes us so accessible to beginners is that it has a automatic ingestion script that you can easily run with whatever file you put in so super simple instructions here for how to ingest your own data so this can be PDFs it can be text files but I'm going to show you that when we get started in a second now the end result once we've got this all set up is you're going to be able to enter queries via the terminal and ask questions about your documents locally so let's jump into the installation scrolling back up to the top of the repo here we can click on this code button and then if we go download zip we're going to download the entire repo so that we can start to use it in our own projects once it's downloaded you're going to need to unzip the files you can use your favorite extractor double click on it if you're on a Mac it's going to expand it out to this folder here I'm going to be running private GPT within vs code so you can open that up with me or if you have a different IDE which you like to use you can use it also but easy way to open this for Mac users is to click on this folder here and just drag to your applications bar and drop it onto Visual Studio code and it's going to open it up yes I trust the authors now for Windows users you can open up visual studio code and head up to this file section here just open the app and then you can open folder and then you need to go to your downloads and open the folder that you've just downloaded as soon as you enter vs code you need to add a folder for your model so we can do that by clicking this folder button up here and go models and now I need to go to my downloads and drag all of those models that I downloaded the two different models and I need to drag them into that models folder on screen you can see the two models that I've downloaded I'm just going to drag them into this models folder and let them copy over to that with those models copied over correctly now we can install our required dependencies so we have this requirements.txt file we're just going to install everything we need to run this correctly as you can see back on the GitHub repo here has in this environment setup section A pip install command that's going to install those requirement automatically so you can copy this command head back to your terminal that we've just opened up by going new terminal and then I can paste that command in there and run it now if you get the same error as me here which is saying command not found pip you need to actually run pip 3 install so you can paste it in here we can see pip3 install requirements.txt now I can run that it's going to install all of these dependencies here and now we're ready to get started so taking a look onto the left we actually have a folder here that they've created for us which is called Source documents so this is where you can put any document that you want to ingest into it they give us by default the State of the Union which is sort of default land chain document we can roll with this one for the purposes of this video but you can delete this and copy in any document that you want say I had a a different document in my downloads I could just drag it into that Source documents folder and then you could follow this step along just make sure that the name is changed when you're running the command on the left hand side if you click on the ingest dot Pi file you can see that this is going to be using some Lang chain document loaders and text Splitters Etc out of the box private GPT doesn't actually have support for PDF files so I'm gonna have this little code snippet available in the description for you guys to steal which I've whipped up quickly here which is going to essentially allow you to put in your own PDF files without first converting them all it's doing here is doing a little check on what the document type is if it's a PDF it's going to use a different document loader from langchain but if it's a normal text file is going to use the the normal private GPT document loader in order to get this little PDF extension enabled you need to head up to the corner and go on the top row here we can see a text loader we just need to add in pi PDF loader as well to the document along chain document loaders and now this is going to remove the squiggly line there what you're also going to need to do is go pip 3 or just pip install Pi PDF and then one more line of code that you need to add is actually import OS and then everything should be ready to go and we can start ingesting our documents remember to save this file when you're done now we can get onto ingesting our documents if we hop back onto the GitHub repo we can see the instructions for ingesting our own data center here pretty simple stuff but we need to run Python and gest.pi and then a path to our text file so again this is using a text file but we have added support to allow you to use PDFs as well so if we just copy all of this I'm going to just pop it into the code down the bottom here just make a little bit of space I'll show you exactly how you can get this set up the easiest way to get the path to the exact document that you want is just to right click on it and click copy relative path then come here and delete the entire thing here including the carrots and now you have the entire command ready to go I can copy that head down to my terminal and go Python 3 actually in my case I need to change this to python 3. you may need to do the same and then we can come down paste this in and ingest it now this is going to run in your terminal down here for quite a long time it's going to go through the entire document chunking it up and then putting it into this DB folder up here that it creates and it's going to store your index here so that whenever you ask questions to it it can ask the DB and recall different chunks out of it so I don't want to get stuck in the weeds there but essentially that's where all of your database is going to be stored now after a couple of minutes that's finally finished indexing that information so what we have up here is our DB all ready to go and ready to be queried now we need to actually run the script run this private gbt.pi app which is going to actually allow us to chat to that data what we can do is head back to the GitHub repo here and it's going to show us to run it ask questions about your documents locally we just need to run this python privategpt.pi for me I'm going to need to run a python 3. you may need to as well Python 3 and then paste that in private gpt.pi and we can run that it's going to look all complicated while it loads these models up but now it says enter a query so I can say I'm talking about the State of the Union here so what did the prayers then say about NATO and here we see after a few issues with tokenizing these unknown tokens it's actually answering the question here as you can see answer the president has spoken out in support of NATO and his role in maintaining peace and stability in Europe emphasize importance of alliances Etc so it also shows us the question that we asked the answer that it's given and then Source documents as well so this is actually very handy to see what chunks were used in terms of creating this answer so I hope you guys have been able to get this working as you can see these sort of tokenizing Errors pop up quite a lot you may have different issues depending on the documents that you put in there now given that I've added this little PDF extender so you can use the ingestion script on PDFs as well you should be able to add in just drop a PDF in there and run the script and it's going to install it just to make this tutorial bulletproof and I know in a couple weeks and months coming up ahead this may change a little bit but be sure to check the repo for the latest information on how to install this it's all going to be available here if it changes but also if you run into errors in the terminal window here it can help to just copy and paste it into jgbt and ask it for an answer it might be a very very simple fix that you can do yourself without having to ask for help for anyone else so that's about it for the video guys I wanted to make this super short and sweet so that you can download this repo have a play around with it and start chatting to your documents locally without any internet connection now if you do have any issues with this and want some help you can join my AI entrepreneurship Discord which is in the description and in the pin comment you can hop in there and ask some of the developers within the community if you can get a little bit of help with this but beyond that if you also want to reach out to me at the consultant and work on any projects like this or other AI applications you can book a Consulting pool with me in the description and in the pin comment and if you want to work on my development company to build out something bigger then you can also get in touch with me through my Consulting link that's all for the video guys thank you so

              "text": "now these kind of outputs I think are really really powerful considering how much work has gone into this this bot in this video I'm going to be showing you how I created an AI version of Alex from Ozzie by taking hundreds of transcripts from his podcast and feeding it into a chat bot and how you can take this exact same application that I've built and template it and start to build your own AI personalities for yourself for personal and business use now before we actually jump into the code editor and start to see this thing in action I thought I'd give you guys a quick high level overview of how these kind of applications work so what I've built here is actually called a custom mods chatbot not to be confused with training your own model which is what a lot of people think oh I want to train a model on my own data that's not what we're doing and that's not what people do in a lot of cases with llm applications currently so the easiest way to break down a customized chat borders into the few components that it takes so the first component is going to be the custom knowledge base so what I'm doing in this project is taking a bunch of information from Alex and mozzie's podcast and I'm putting it into this custom knowledge base that our chatbot is going to have access to what happens when a user queries it puts in a question say I I'm asking a question about how to build a better sales process where you're going to take what the user has queried we are going to essentially search our database of all the information from the transcripts we're going to search for anything that's similar to what I've asked about the sales process and then our Vector database is going to retrieve say three to five different chunks of text which are most similar to what we're asking about it's going to pull that information out of the database and then it's going to match that with the user input so can you give me a plan about my sales process and then we're going to get a large language model like GPT 3.5 turbo or gpt4 and we're going to say okay can you answer this user's question with the context that we've just retrieved from the knowledge base so an easy way of understanding this that I always tell my clients is that these custom old chatbot systems allow you to go from say 100 000 tokens of data and then when the user queries you're able to pick out only the most relevant parts to that query out of the hundreds of thousands of tokens of data so by creating a system like this when the user queries we can have hundreds of thousands of document comments or pages when the user queries the chat bot we're only going to retrieve a couple different pieces of that information that are most relevant to the query so we essentially filter down to only what's most relevant to the user and we use that information to send to our llm like the Chachi PT API and then we answer the question given that context and what they asked originally so with that out of the way we can jump into the code here and I'm going to give you guys a very high level sort of skim over the code here I'm not going to do a full coding breakdown tutorial here maybe I'll do that in another video if you guys want it but all of this code is going to be available on GitHub if you want to clone it if you want to Fork it and leave a staff if you feel like it so we're going to jump into this and I'm going to break down very quickly how it works so the first step in actually building one of these applications is to do what's called a document Pipeline and this is essentially how are you going to take your raw data or in my case YouTube videos or podcast and how am I going to bridge that what are the processes that I'm going to take in order to get it chopped up in the way I want the right information put into the metadata and then I'm going to send that off to my Vector database which I'm going to be using Pinecone so from transcript to vectorize data in my database that's sort of the distance that the document pipeline covers now for the purposes of this video I don't have time to go through my entire document Pipeline and show you things under the hood but if you guys want to see that in another video please let me know down below because this is a pretty key part that I feel like you guys could get some value out of I just don't want to drag this thing out too much for the people who aren't necessarily that technical so just from a high level we have these three different notebooks here that I've created which is one that did the transcription the second one that is my data Pipeline and the third that is the indexing notebook that essentially takes that data and puts into the python database now I did this through the podcast application I went to see all and then I just downloaded a whole bunch here I got up to about 160 downloads so the current version of the homozy GPT is using 163 podcast transcripts so that can continue to be added to and I found the more more information that I add though the better the retrieval becomes because there's more similarity Etc but essentially the more that I add in it seems to be getting better which is probably how you expect it to go I downloaded all of those podcasts then you're able to actually find them locally on your computer where they're stored which Apple probably doesn't want you to do but you can find them and I drag them all over into this folder called podcast so I have 100 plus audio files of all of the different podcasts that I downloaded and then I head to essentially transcribe those using the whisper apis so basically this transcription notebook just took in the MP3 files chopped them up into sizes that were okay for the whisper API I sent it off to open ai's whisper API and got it transcribed very very cheaply which is good I think it's about a sixth of a cent per minute so the output of that was going to be a text file based on every podcast so for every MP3 file I now had a DOT text file that I was able to use in the next part of the pipeline now the next step was to take all of those text files that I'd gotten and prepare them to be put into the index so I have this data pipeline file and essentially I go through here and I chunk it up into different sizes so I think I went for about 512 tokens and so every single piece of data was around 512 or less so that I could take all of those chunks and then put them into the regular database one by one now after chunking everything up I got a massive data frame that was filled with information like this so as you can see here this is one transcript that has been split up into multiple different things so all of them have their token count around 500 or less so the chunking has worked correctly I've broken down what was probably 10 000 tokens of this attention is the new oil I think is the name of it and I've chopped that into multiple different parts of that are just 500 tokens each and now those are all ready to be individually put into the vector database with that all done I was able to save it to a CSV here and then I was going to go over to my indexing so this is the indexing notebook that I created essentially what we do is take all of those chunks that we've created and each row of the CSV we're going to embed the data in that and then we're going to insert that into the pinecon database so I won't bore you with the details essentially I just read in the CSV I do a bunch a little bit more manipulation of the data and then I was able to put that all into my Pinecone database and save that index ready for later recall with nvs code and within the app that you're going to see now so with the data pipeline out of the way we can now jump into the app that allows you to interact with that so this app is responsible for essentially taking in user input and then querying the index we've just created pulling back similar results combining those two together and then giving the response fonts and then also creating a sort of nice sui for it so that we're able to chat to it in a visual way now to keep this short and sweet and because I know most you guys are probably just going to download this change out your API Keys Etc and try this on your own data what I can show you here is essentially those parts here you need to go into the EMV file up here which you're going to need to create yourself on GitHub this dot EMV file will not be there what you'll need to do is right click go new file and go dot EMV then you're going to need to create these variables you can see it in here actually I'll blur these out essentially you're going to need to write this and go equals and then put it in as strings so all of these different things open AI API key then pine cone API key Pinecone index name Pinecone environment and the pycon endpoint so all that info you're going to need to put in yourself but once you have that set up and here it should be importing it all correctly and here we have the sort of core functionality of the app which is to one of them is to get the embedding so what's going to happen when you use a queries the app we're going to put it through this function here which is going to return the open AI embeddings using the Adda 002 model once we have those embeddings of the user query we can pass it off to the semantic search that's going to search alpinecone database for things that are similar to what the users ask for it can be three different chunks it can be five different chunks you're able to specify it with this top K parameter but that's essentially the the medium potatoes of the application then what we go through to is our app.pi and here when a user sends a message it triggers this generate response now if you're not familiar with streamlit here's a quick crash course the main action of this app is going on down here so this is the the text input essentially where the user is going to be entering their question so this St dot text input which is a streamlit text input this is the on change function the generate response so this is essentially on submit when they submit their question this is going to trigger this function here which is this big boy right here so the generic response function is going to generate a sponsor from the user prompt so the main action going on here is the semantic search function so when we take in the prompt from the user which is available here that's st.sessionstate.prompt and then top K as I mentioned before is a number of chunks that we want to retrieve so we want to retrieve three different chunks from this we're going to take the user prompt we're going to pass it to our semantic search function it's going to embed the user query it's going to query our Vector database with those embeddings and it's going to return the three most similar chunks related to the query so say using the sales example again I ask how can I build a sales funnel or what what are some tips on building my sales process out it's going to embed that it's going to search for essentially anything to do with sales in the vector database and it's going to pull the top K or the top three which we've inserted in here it's going to pull three similar chunks back and then save it in the search results variable then in order to combine the context that we've just gotten from a vector database with the user query we're using a prompt template here so what we have is the user query this is what I've called the human template and this is going to contain the context that we've just received from the database and the user query so this is what we're essentially submitting to the language model here is the user query here are relevant transcript Snippets now above you can see a system message if you're not familiar with how these work this is one of the things that you can send off to open AI chat completion endpoints in the system message is essentially setting the mode or setting the tone of the bot so here I've put in your web Alex homozy a successful entrepreneur you have access to transcripts be aware that transcripts may not always be relevant to the query you need to analyze each of them carefully so now playing around with this prompt is actually one of the highest leverage tasks that you could do because a few small changes in this can completely change the output of the bot so there is a lot of experimentation to be done that I haven't really done at this stage but if you guys want me to continue to work on the spot I could definitely play around with the sister message more I've got a ton of other features that I think I could build into it but that'll all depend on if you guys are interested in it and want to see me continue to work on this of course it's all going to be available on GitHub so I can continue to connect continue to add more stuff to put over time the last thing to do is to combine the user query with the context that we just created here we can see the context that we receive from the search results and then we're going to what I call construct messages so this is going to essentially handle some of the chat history and make sure that we're always keeping a running chat history going don't need to look into that too much but it works trust me so what we're going to do is create those that those messages and then we're going to send off the messages to the open AI chat completion endpoint with the GPT 3.5 model and we're going to be putting in those messages that I generated enter the messages variable for the API call here I'm using the GPT 3.5 turbo model and it it's just really quick and snappy for these kind of chatbot applications so that's what I'm liking using at the moment but essentially we're going to be catching this response saving it as bot response and then we're going to be printing that to the UI so I think that's a good enough rundown I hope you guys can sort of figure out what we're doing here but now we can jump into actually seeing this in action and I can show you some of the outputs that we can get from it to run stream apps all you need to do is type streamlit run app.pi now we have homozygpt this is what a typical stream UI looks like so here we can go I found that the really interesting use case for this kind of Bot is to ask it for sort of business plans and specific outputs not just asking questions hey how do I do this with this actually putting a little bit of context in there and saying write me a plan or give me a guide so I've got here I have a lawnmower company that's doing ten thousand dollars per month write me a digital marketing plan on how I can get more leads and grow my business and so what this is doing it's taking a query that I've just given it it's embedding it with the same embedding model that we've put all of our chunks into our Vector database with it's going to take that embedding which is just a bunch of numbers and then since you're searching for the most similar numbers in the database and it's going to retrieve three different chunks that are most similar to that it's going to put that into that prompt template and it's going to take the query that I just put in and I was going to try to answer the query with the information from the database so what have we got and so here we can see a little bit of errors with the prompting this is what I probably need to try and iron out over time but based on transcripts first step in your digital marketing plan should be analyze your pricing off a cost of acquisition so we've got a pretty decent response from Aussie GPT already here you can see talking about 30 day cash High ticket premium offering focus on brand building rather than a direct response so not very specific I did ask for a plan now I thought I'd drill a little bit deeper and say okay give me a detailed digital marketing plan for my lawn mowing business with the aim of brand building not direct response what kind of content and ads should I be creating so build your brand over the long term it's important to focus on creating high quality content establishing thought leadership in your industry and leveraging social media to expand your reach I'll let you guys pause this for a second and have a read now these kind of outputs I think are really really powerful considering how much work has gone into this this bot and you can only imagine how good they could get if you continue to add more and more context play with more and more prompting and I think here things like email marketing developing a newsletter leverage social media developer content marketing strategy for for someone who's not necessarily that plued up when it comes to digital strategy having a bot like this to chat to could be pretty pretty valuable I've yet to really test it on how granular you can get with it so if I provide a ton of information about the business how good he could respond say I was to ask okay I need a Content marketing strategy for my lawn mowing business we do this this provide as much content and then ask for a really granular plan I think if you guys can can download this and start playing around with it and let me know how good you can get the responses and what sort of outcomes you are getting that will be really really helpful and if you want to contribute on GitHub I'd really appreciate that too given that I've put a 163 podcasts in already and it seems to have a very flexible understanding of homozy sort of knowledge and what he talks about often so you have gone a little bit deeper and I've said okay should I base the content marketing around me personally around the company so as he's mentioning a digital content marketing strategy here and he says based on the transcripts which is I need to get that bit bargained out but my recommendation will be to focus on building the band of your company rather than building around you personally and educational content interactive content customer success stories so this is all all pretty solid business advice I'd say in terms of digital marketing they could definitely do that and I think it's pulling from the knowledge base in the right way and this is only using 3.5 turbo so I've tried with gpt4 but I don't think the sort of trade-off between speed and and reasoning and intelligence is really worth it at the moment I thought I'd give you one more example of this thing in action now these are not script that I haven't tested these responses or anything Aussie talks a lot about 20 year old men and 20 year old people on how you can make the most out of your 20s and sort of more of a life coach rather than a business coach so I've decided to go a little bit personal with it I've said I'm a 22 year old entrepreneur what should I be focusing on in order to maximize my long-term success see what he says I've got back a pretty good response from Alex talking about how I should focus on the customer invest in myself build passive streams of income Embrace constraints I thought was an interesting one talking about rather than changing the business just to challenge yourself do sort of micro challenges within the business to not get distracted from the big task that you're sort of doing the Reps on so I think it's very interesting now just to be clear guys this is a V1 product this is the most basic thing that I could get up and was happy showing you guys on YouTube I think there's a lot more stuff that could be done with this I think you could do deep fakes you could do voice generation you could do I could speak to it and it could reply to me like that so there's also all sorts of things to be done in terms of how this chat function interacts because this is always querying the custom knowledge base every single time I message it when you can essentially set it up so that it only queries in knowledge base when it's needed and then otherwise they can just use them Mission that's already in the chat history so don't want to get too too Stuck In The Weeds there but there's so much that we could do with this and if you guys want to contribute that GitHub link is going to be in the description so you can either go down there and clone it and start to do some work on it and and come up with improvements on the homozy GPT itself or you can use it for your own applications and maybe have a coaching business maybe you want to create an artificial version of yourself or one of your clients this can all be done using this framework that are provided the only thing missing for you is that data pipeline side of things so you're going to need to prepare your own data and create your own Pinecone index and then as you can see in the dot EMV files you need to change the index name so you can switch it over to another one but if you guys would like me to make an entire video on how I did the document pipeline for this chat bot and how I took the transcripts transcribe them chop them up and put them into the Vic database and I can definitely do that just please let me know down below and I can do a part two on the Samosa GPT so that about wraps it up for the video guys if you have any questions and please leave them down in the comments below I'll be answering as many as I can and as always if this is lit up any light bulbs in your head and you want to reach out to me as a consultant a chat about some of your ideas or potentially work with my development company in terms of getting this built out then you can reach me as a consultant in the description let's have a chat and get something built if you've enjoyed the video and want to support me making more stuff like this please hit down below leave a like on the video

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be showing you the fastest and easiest way that you can create a custom knowledge chat GPT using Lang chain that's trained on your own data from your own PDFs I've seen a lot of different tutorials that have over complicated this a little bit so I thought I'd hop on and make a fast and to the point version that you're able to copy and paste my code and get started with building these custom knowledge tools for your business and for your personal use as quickly as possible now if you're familiar with applications like chat PDF where you're able to drag and drop in a document and start chatting over it what we're going to be building today is essentially the exact same thing you're going to be able to take that functionality and put your own PDFs in and then use it for any purposes that you like but the best part about what I'm about to show you is that this method is going to give you complete flexibility and customization over how your app works and how the documents are processed now just quickly I'd like to plug my AI newsletter which is launched recently now if you want to get all of the hottest and latest AI news they're still down to a quick five minute read and delivered to your email then be sure to head down below and sign up to that firstly we'll be going through a very very brief explainer on how these systems work and the different part involved so that you can understand what we're building here and how it all works and then secondly we're going to be jumping straight into the notebook that I've created for this video that you're going to be able to copy and paste over to your projects and just change the name of the PDF okay guys here's a quick visualization of how this is actually working under the hood so this is the system we are creating using Lang chain which is essentially going to take in our documents chunk it embed it put it in a vector database and then allow users to query it and get answers back so I'll take us through this step by step now so the first step here is to take a document and split it into smaller pieces now this is done because when we are recalling it and querying the database in order to get an answer based on the document we need to receive a bunch of smaller chunks that are relevant to the user's query and not just the entire massive information so step one here is to chunk it we're going to be doing it in 512 tokens or less so we're going to chunk our document down into however many chunks needed in order to get below this 512 tokens per piece and then what we're going to do is take the chunks and embed each one of them one by one so we're using the adder002 model by open AI which is by far one of the best embedding models available right now then we're going to be able to take all of these different embeddings for each chunk and put them into a vector database so that they're ready for recall when the user queries then the final step is to allow users to actually query the database so we do this by taking in the user's query we put it through these exact same embedding model that we do over here and then you query the database based on the embeddings of the user's query so we get back a number of documents that are most similar to what the user is speaking about and then we're also able to pass that around to a large language model and include it in the context so we take also the user's query and then the match documents combine them together and ask the language model hey can you answer this question given this context and then we're able to send the answer back to the user so that's a very quick high level overview of how these applications work now we can jump straight into building it now at the top here we've got a summary of all the different steps we're going to be going over so you can take a look at that but we can jump straight into these installs and imports now simplified it all down so you guys can just run these cells as you go through so you can run that you need to run this cell here which is going to install all of the packages my API key is already set up you need to replace this with your API key and once those are all installed you're ready to get started now for the purposes of my chat bot in this video I'm going to be using attention is all you need which is the Transformers research paper that was done by Google so I thought it'd be interesting to use this within the chat bot so here we can see I'm using it here attention is all you need.pdf all you need to do is come if you're using a different document when you clone this notebook you can go over to the left side panel here and drag in your document and upload it once you've got it uploaded you can come back and change the name here so replace this with the name of your PDF and then you're ready to go the first main step we have is loading the PDFs and chunking the data with Lang chain so we've got two different methods here that I wanted to show you one is the very easy and straightforward version that Lang chain offers which is just using this simple page loader using pipe pdfloader and that's just going to take the PDF that you've given it it's going to chop it into pages and then you're going to get all of those pages as documents ready to use in your in your system now this method is great if you're doing a quick test but I thought I'd show you a more advanced method which is going to be splitting up your documents into roughly similar size chunks now there are a number of different factors that go into creating a customized chatbot system like this and the chunk size is actually one of those and it can determine a lot in terms of the quality of the output so this script we have here is going to allow you to split it by chunk and you can actually set the size of the chunks here so I've got it at 512 at the moment with that overlap of 24. now the first step in this Advanced chunking method is to use text track and text tracker is going to extract all of the information out of the PDF and save it to this Dock and then second we're going to need to save it as a text file and then reopen that text file now this is just to get around some issues that can frequently come up depending on the documents you use so we save it to a new text file and then we reopen that text file then you need to actually create a function that allows you to count the number of tokens so here you can see I've used a gpt2 tokenizer and then we've just made this little function count tokens this is going to take in some some text in the form of a string and it's going to return the number of tokens so this tokenizer here actually counts the number of tokens and then finally we create the text splitter which is this Lang chain type called recursive character text splitter takes in a chunk size which is variable as I mentioned and then we need to put in the length function which we've just created here so final step is going to be creating the chunks objects by passing in the text that we got up here that we've opened up from our text file passing it into the create documents function and then that's going to create all of the chunks and type land change schema document now one quick best practice that I want to show you guys is actually to do a quick visualization of the distribution of the chunks to make sure that this chunking processor has done it correctly it's done it to the correct size that we've mentioned so if you just run the cell you don't need to know the specifics of it but this essentially shows you the distribution of these different chunks so we've got a couple that are over the limit but that comes down to this recursive splitter so on the most part we don't have anything that uh thousands and thousands of tokens they're all roughly within the range that we wanted and then we need to create our Vector database which again Lang chain made super simple with this faiss package and we're going to take in the chunks that we created and also there's some bidding model and then it's going to embed all of that store it in the vector database and then we're going to get this DB variable back out again Lang chain makes this super simple we just need to set up our query which is who created Transformers and then all we need to do is run a similarity search on the database using the query and then we're going to get that back so and there we go so if you put this little bit in here at the bottom which is LIN docks you can actually see that this is uh based on this query it's actually pulling back four different uh chunks that match the query so that's going to give you an idea of how much context is actually being grabbed from the vector database with each query then we essentially take that functionality that we've just created and combine it with a lang chain chain chain which is going to take in a query so we can do the same thing who created Transformers we're going to retrieve the docs and then we're going to run a chain and that's going to take in the query and the docs and then it's going to give us an output so that is combining the context that's being retrieved from the similarity search with the query and then answering it as you'd expect it to so if we run this who created Transformers it's going to do that similarity search bring in the documents then also take the user query and then say okay let's run a language model on this one of openai's language models to answer the question and here we have the answer now I thought I'd throw in a little extra goodie for you guys here which is to convert this functionality into an actual chat bot so I get this a lot in my videos like yeah you showed us the functionality but how can I actually use this into kind of chat bot so this is just a quick one that I've worked up if we run this this is going to be using the another land chain component which is going to be this conversational retrieval chain which takes in a language model and it's going to take the database that we created and use it as a retriever function so you don't need to know too much about it but just run the cell and then here is a little chat bot Loop that's going to allow us to interact with this knowledge base in a chat format so here I can go who created Transformers and there we have it it started to answer us were they smart we have a custom knowledge chatbot using Lang chain that takes in your own PDFs chunks them up embeds them creates a vector store and then allows you to retrieve those and answer questions based on that information and this does have chat memory included into it as you can see here who who created Transformers gives a name were they smart I don't know so here you can see that the chat memory is actually working you have a customized chat bot with chat memory that about wraps it up for the video guys thank you so much for watching all of this code is going to be available in the description for you to clone this notebook change the PDF out and start to use it for your own purposes now if you've enjoyed this video and want to see more content

applications with Lang chain to show you the different use cases and see how good these models really are now within this tutorial I'm going to be taking you through a number of different ways to install it because it can be pretty difficult as I found out myself now I'm making this video because I've had a number of requests and comments on videos and also through my consultations with clients about the privacy concerns that people have regarding where the information is being sent off to If You're Building applications with open AIS apis what about all my customer data what about all my organization data I don't want to be sending that off to them how can I run this locally or how can I safeguard that data so that is protected and not exposed in any unnecessary way now there's not many solutions currently about this issue of data privacy within AI based applications but what we're going to be going through today is one most promising solutions to it which is to start creating powerful language models that are run locally so we don't even have to send all of our information off to the apis we can run it on machines and it eventually run it on our servers that we are deploying our applications to now if you're not familiar with what GPT for all is it's GPT for all and for everyone and it is a open source application a set of language models that you're able to download and start using locally and here you can see in their own words they have demo data and code to train open source assistant style large language models based on gptj and llama so gptj is the open source version of GPT and the Llama is Facebook's language model framework that they've released recently but it's still actually restricted to research purposes only now over the past few days I've been going over this technology and seeing how far I can push it how much I can get out of it so what we're going to be doing in this video is a quick guide on installing which can be quite difficult if you're a Mac User like myself it caused me a lot of issues I basically spent an entire day trying to get this thing set up so if you're a Mac User you'll be getting a crash course on how to get this thing set up if you're a Windows user I think you're going to be having a lot easier time so you'll be able to skip ahead but we're going to get stuck into installing this now I'm going to be taking us through a number of different ways of actually implementing mention this code and using these language models but the end goal here and the final product that we're going to get to is a custom knowledge based chat bot like many of the videos that I've done previously but it's going to be run locally so you're going to be able to provide your own PDFs or documents let's go into chop it up chunk it up embed it put it into a vector database that's run locally and then you're going to be able to query that through a chatbot style interface that has chat history so a lot to take in there but we're going to have a custom mods chat bot with chat history as the end result so stick with me because we're going to get there in the end so let's jump into getting this thing installed on your guys computer now in order to get started with installing this we need to head over to the GitHub repo which I'll be linking in the description but here we can scroll down and start to take a look at the different ways of getting this installed and to start using it locally now they've actually recently released an application that allows you to run it in a nice application on your laptop so that's what you can see here you can download that and have a play around with it and actually test the abilities of it and see how good it is and how it Stacks up to the sort of GPD 3.5 turbo and all of the ones that we're used to playing with so if you want to check that out super easy to download store you've got the three different operating systems here that you can download but we're actually interested in building applications with this so being able to use it and chat to it is basically useless to us maybe we just use chat TPT so we actually want to get access to these models and interact with them programmatically so we need to scroll down and actually start building with them now if you head down to the python client section we have the first way of getting the setup and installed so what you're going to need to do is run this pip install nomic command so if you head over to vs code here what you can do is come into your terminal section down the bottom and then you can run pip install nomec now it's all installed on my computer already so I can head back and we can copy this code here which is the basic setup and here we have it paste it in this so what you can see here is this is The Notebook library that we just installed you're importing this GPT for all so in order to test if this is actually working you need to run python or python3 and then the name of the file so I've named this Nomex setup.pi so now if I run this you can see that it waits for a bit so what that's actually going to do is start the download of gpt4 all so that it is downloaded on your machine locally here in Colombia my my internet is quite slow so I haven't been able to do it using this method but if this works for you initially and you're able to start prompting then you're away to the races and you can start plugging this into all of the stuff we're about to do but this is essentially the first way of testing if you can get this set up and working now if you run into issues and you can start troubleshooting it and going through these different stages that I'm going to show you now so heading back to the GitHub repo we go back to this python client section and now we're going to go through to this link here which is the official python bindings for GPT for all now this is called Pi GPT for all and this is what we're going to be using in the next way of installing and setting it up so as usual we need to install something so we can copy this pip install Pi GPT for all and I'm going to head over to this file all of this code is going to be available for you guys to download so here we have the basic setup that I'm going to show you in a second but down in your terminal you need to go pip install Pi GPT for all it's already set up for me then once that's installed you can head down to the usage section and it's going to provide us a snippet of how to set things up so if we copy this and hit back this is essentially what we've got set up here so this is just importing the modules sitting the model from the link which you've got here and here here in the code what we have is a way to load the model so what we have is GPT for all and then the route where the model is stored on our computer so you're going to need to download this file I'm going to have a link to it in the description but over on the side here you can see a folder called models and we have the GPT for all converted which is the model we're going to be using and then we have a second one here which we're going to be discussing later so what you need to do is download them using a link that I'll provide in the description so you have to get this exact one and I had a nightmare trying to get my hands on this because the ones that they actually provide a lot of the time through the documentation they need to go through this conversion process in order to get them to the state where they can work so I'm going to save you a couple hours of headache by just providing you with a direct link to the converted model that should be ready to work as soon as possible for you locally so head to the description and download this GPT for all converted.bin and then put it into your models file here and then you can come back and now we can check this code yep it all looks good here we have the prompt that we're putting into the model and then we can come back save this command s and then go Python 3 Pi GPT then we can go python3 or python whichever your system setup is and then the name of your file so this one for me is pi GPT for all setup so if I run this then it's going to run this completion once upon a time once upon a time 100 million years ago dinosaurs ruled if let's wrote in a little written a little story for us here now if this has worked for you that is great news but if you're a Mac User you likely had a little bit of trouble and it's not able to get this output yet so I'm going to help you through a crash course on how I was able to get chat CPT to help me solve this which saved me a lot of time so if you're using anaconda or condo that was what was causing the issues for me so I had to actually uninstall Anaconda fully I have all of these instructions in a document down in the description if you want to go through this and follow this but I'll just briefly run through it now I had to uninstall Anaconda then I had to download and install mini Forge following these instructions here so once I had mini Forge installed I had to set up a virtual environment so that I can install all of the packages onto this virtual environment that was separate so I know it sounds complicated but all of these things are going to be in it in the description for any Mac User that struggled so you can just follow through the steps that either order to get this virtual environment set up that is working correctly so as you can see down here I'm actually in a virtual environment called GPT for all now if you're not using condo or anaconda you might not be running into any of these issues so that's great but if you are then you can follow those instructions in the description now that we're able to get a basic setup running with this little script here we can now get onto a couple more advanced applications using langchang which is the really exciting stuff so if we head over to basic Lang chain here this is essentially going to be doing the same thing but using prompt templates and change from langche so if you're following along and want to reuse this code you can download all the code from the GitHub repo in the description but we're going to be going through this now so the key thing here is to get land chain installed but you need to get the correct version now because this is such a Cutting Edge Library it is being updated every couple of days and you will run into issues if you're not specifically mentioning their version of land chain you want to install so I'll just run you through that now now whenever you're watching this video I urge you to head to this link here Pi Pi which is the python package index and you're going to be able to check out the most current version which finally I did this literally yesterday today and it's already been updated again so this thing is being updated nearly every day or two so in order to prevent any issues you need to specify the exact version you want to get installed but make sure it's the latest version I'm going to be leaving a link to this website in the description so you can check what the most up-to-date version is when you install so in order to install the correct version of land chain what you need to do is copy this then head back to vs code then you need to go pip install Lang chain but at the end of it Go equals equals and then enter in the latest version here which is 0.0.1149 so you'll see able to actually update it for me because I had 0.148 installed so make sure you're getting the latest version and you're actually specifying that with the equals equals and then the version after that so now that we have it installed all of these things up here should be working for you as you can see we're using the GPT for all import from the llms package so same sort of thing here we have the local path for the the model that we're working with which you can see over here the Callback manager which you need to set up as part of Lang chain and then we have a template here now this is just an example one that you could use here we have a question and then the templated insertion of the question here then the answer listing step by step so it puts the model into a Chain of Thought style of answer which typically works better for these models because they're not as good at responding as you're used to with these other open AI models and so for the rest of this we're just setting up the prompt which is using the prompt template we've provided the input variable of the question so whenever we ask a question to this as we do down here and here it's going to be replacing that question parameter with the question that we're setting so in this method here which we're just hard coding the question which is what does NFL team won the Super Bowl and the year Justin Bieber was born we can hard code in the question here and then below it we also have a way of accepting user input through the terminal so we'll just run through both of them now quickly the final part of the script here is to use llm chain dot run so we've set up our chain here using the llm and the prompt we have and then the question and then the llm chain is going to run that process so now if I go to the terminal and I go Python 3 basic Lang change setup dot Pi run that it's going to set up the model and then it's going to ask the question whether we've hard-coded in here what NFL team as you can see here and now it's going to show you the output of the model in the terminal here so that's a bit of thinking now here we get an example of the actual quality of the output of these models so asking a question what is NFL team won the Super Bowl and the year Justin Bieber was born so it should go okay what year was Justin Bieber born okay and then you can use its prior knowledge of both who Justin Bieber is and then off that particular year and who won the Super Bowl to give us the answer and this Chain of Thought method is supposed to help it get there but as you can see it sort of just goes on with gibberish I've seen other people get create responses with this but I haven't seemed to be able to do it this potentially could go back to the fact that as we can see here on the GitHub repo they do have a GPT for all J model and they do have just a GPT for all models so maybe the differences between gptj and in the the Llama model they're using could determine the quality of the output but I urge you to actually just download the other model unfortunately my instance a bit slow here so I don't have time for this video but here you can see they're using the GPT for all J version you'll need to convert it but once you converted it you can actually test the output back to back and see if it's actually getting you closest First example of getting output from these is not that great so we're going to keep going and see how good we can get a custom knowledge chatbot to work with this as well and just quickly you can turn this into a user input based bot by uncommenting this line we'll comment this one out so this is essentially just asking for a input so when the slide runs it's going to pop a little input thing down in the terminal and then whatever you enter into that is going to be submitted as a question and then work back into it I just commented out and I save the file again and then I'm able to run this again and now you can see down the bottom it's saying enter your question and I can enter the same thing so as you can see it didn't quite get the answer again but this shows you how you can use a variable input and a user input from the terminal to ask questions to this model so next we're going to be going on to a creating a custom knowledge base and then being able to query that base in sort of a one directional format so this is like creating a llama index you're able to ask on question two by querying that index so this one here is called custommodgequery.pi and we can go through this and I've got a little bit of information on the the script here the script allows you to create a vector store from a file and query it with a question that you hard code the question in it shows you how you could send questions to a GPT for all custom knowledge base and receive answers if you want a chat style interface using a similar custom knowledge base you can check out the other file which we're going to be going over last so this starts off a little bit differently here you can see we have the GPT for all model path which is the same as previously but here we have the Llama path so you're going to have to download by a link I'll provide in the description it took me a while to find all these different models to use they've got this thing working because making them sort of talk to each other can be quite a bit of a struggle so all of the download links for these are going to be in the description but you need to download the specific model which is a llama model that allows you to use the embeddings process of of the Llama model and that's done through here so what you see on the left side here is the models we have both the gbt4 all converted and we also have this llama model on the side and so what we're doing here is taking in an example document which is the state of the union here you can see it's up in the docs file here so we use a shortened version first test that it works and then we use the full version and so this is just the State of the Union a speech from Joe Biden ice Hume talks about Ukraine all that sort of stuff so we're going to be taking that indexing it in the same way you would into a llama index but we're going to be doing this all manually the process here is to use this loader here which is a text loader this is coming from Lang chain so this is going to take the docs from the docs folder it's going to take the shortened state of the union.txt file that we have then it's going to create the Llama embeddings model that we're going to use to embed all of that information into our Vector store and then we're going to initialize the llam as GPT for all with the the path to the model that we referenced up here so this is essentially all the setup and then we have a couple functions that's going to allow us to create this custom knowledge base index so first of all depending on the size of the document you may need to chunt the text up so we have a split chunks function here that's using this particular function from Lang chain we can specify the chunk size all that sort of stuff but I just leave that there for now and then we need to actually create the index in the same way you would with something like llama index and then that's going to take in the chunks we just created and it's going to return an index and we're using this if a ISS packaged as part of the Lang chain Vector store so this comes with as a supported way of creating a vector store or a vector database with land chain which is very handy and what this is going to do is return that search index for us so that we can start using it and then finally we have this similarity search function which is going to take in the user query and it's going to take in the index we've created and give back essentially the match documents that match the query so this is what we're going to take into the the final generation phase of okay we have all the context now let's actually answer the question so this is the same sort of custom knowledge base chatbot style setup so now what we need to do is actually call all of these different functions we need to take in our documents create an index and then we're actually going to save the index so that we don't have to keep doing it again because as you'll see these models can take a very long time to generate all of the embeddings and create the index so I'm going to have this line here which allows us to save it to a local file so that we don't have to run over this every time we boot the app which is something I'd suggest so first off I'm creating our index it's going to need to create the docs using the loader up here which we've created so this is reference to the shortened State of the Union text the little slash of it we're going to test first then down here you have the chunks which it then takes the documents that it's taken from that text file and then it's going to split that into chunks and then we're going to take those chunks and we're going to create the index out of it so on your first time actually running the script what you're going to want to do is actually comment all of this out I'd say and then when you run this it's going to go through it's going to take your document it's going to chunk it up create the index and then it's going to save it to this name that you put here and as you can see on the left here I've actually already got this set up here so this is the state of the union index that's the Little Slice that we're talking about before so this is a small index on a on the shortened set of text that we've provided and once you've actually got it saved there and ready to go then you can comment this out and you can uncomment all of this below then every time you run the app from then on you're not going to have to wait a few minutes for this to index the data and save it you can actually just pull it from a local file by using this line here so pulls from the same embeddings that you did to create it which was set up there and then you're going to be pulling from the local files on the side to get the index set up and now finally we can actually query our custom index so you have the question here hard coding the the questions to summarize the contents about NATO and its purpose so what I've done here is actually taken uh just so it's a little bit more context I've done the full document it's taken quite a while off screen but I've got the full State of the Union here indexed and saved using this method above and what I'm going to do is ask it to summarize the comments about NATO and its purpose and here we have another prompt template which is essentially using the land chain to help get the right outputs out of it and essentially frame this up and here we have the similarity search based on the question and the index we're doing so it's going to search that Vector database for the most relevant bits of information on it retrieve that and it's going to give us back in match docs and sources and what it's going to do is essentially please use the following context to answer questions the information that we get back from that similarity search is going to be injected in place of this context variable and then the question of the the user that we took up here that we've hard-coded is going to be put in here so essentially what's the question okay let me grab some context that's relevant to that question put it into the prompt template okay and then what were they asking for in the first place bank now answer the question with all of this context so this is the basic sort of retriever generator system right in front of your eyes and then again just to make it very easy for this model we're using Chain of Thought prompting if you don't know what that is check out my prompt engineering video it's up here we're here I never get it right but let's think step by step so actually thinks through it and it increases the accuracy of the output and then finally what we have at the bottom is just the Lang chain side of things which is packaging this all up taking the taking the template inserting the variables here you can see getting the context back from the similarity search and then sending it off in llmchain.run function and then we're going to get to see the response so let's give this a test out the comment is summarize the comments about NATO and its purpose and we can have a quick look at the State of the Union the full text I'm sure you're familiar with what they State of the Union sort of talks about and then we can go back to this here so now that we have everything set up to query this index we're going to be able to go down to the bottom and into the terminal and go python3 or Python and run custom Lodge query.pi and it's going to take essentially all of the information from the state of the union index which we have created it's going to query it with this question summarize the comments about NATO and its purpose and then return the answer to that by injecting it into this prompt template so let's see what we get so it's init from file which is going to save us a lot of time actually I forgot to do one thing which is comment all of this out as well so if you are running it from a a loaded index then you don't need to do any of the create index of course so make sure you head up there and comment that out and then you can cut back down it's going to save you a ton of time we'll save it again clear the output and run that again and see how quickly it can do it this time so bam straight into answering the question so here you can see it's actually starting to spit out the things that it's retrieved from the custom knowledge base so it's got a couple little Snippets of text from the speech okay it's got a couple mentions of NATO in there it seems to be doing a pretty good job and then it's going to take all of that context that it's it's grabbed put it into the prop template and answer the question with that context okay and here we have our answer it seems to have queried our custom knowledge base correctly we've got a context it's asked the question summarize the comments about NATO and its purpose so NATO is an alliance that was created defend its member states so it's actually done a pretty good job when you've given it a custom knowledge base compared to when it was actually querying its own knowledge that it was trained on so perhaps this is a good example of okay maybe the training data was not as extensive and familiar with current events and the history of the world as we are used to with chat CPT because it just seems to know everything because it had obviously has a better training data set so these models maybe they are better to be used with their own data sets rather than asking it to answer questions like a chat TPT or gpt3 so that was an example of how we can create our own custom knowledge based index and query that and draw insights out of it without ever having to use an API or open Ai and send that data off so everything was done locally on the computer we have the Llama CCP embeddings that we use for the embeddings and then we have GPT for all to generate the answers and now we're on to the final example of what you can build with this now I took a while to get this thing set up and using Lang chain with these custom models but what we have here is a custom knowledge chat bot in the same way that my previous videos went over but I'm able to chat back and forth with a chat history about a custom knowledge base so we're going to go through many of the same steps we did just before but instead of allowing it to just hard code a query or only take one query and get the information back we're going to be able to have a chat to this thing and it's going to remember the context of the chat so that it's kind of like a chat GPT experience but it's limited to the information that we're giving it so most of this is the exact same as the previous example if you go down here you'll see many of the same sort of functions but here we're setting up the the language model as GPT for all I've put in here a context limit which I believe is the max tokens for this particular model and then we have a lot of the same stuff we had before which is to generate the index so all of this code is still in here if you want to use it on its own but because I've already got the index added from the previous step we're able to actually just load the index directly and start getting into using this as a chat so as you can see at the top here I've got the index passed as full saw to index and here on the side you can see I have the full saw to index folder here which is the index we're going to be querying so same sort of thing you're going to want to uncomment all of this and get it to generate you an index but what we're going to be doing is loading it from a local one to save us time the key thing here is to use this conversational retrieval chain from llm which allows us to pass in the LM we want to use which is GPT for all which we set up here and then it's going to take the index that we had created and then use the index as a retriever function I've put in the max token limit here I've had a couple issues with the max token limit on this causing it to break so I've set that down to a conservative 400 now that's going to limit the amount that it retrieves from the index to 400 tokens and then we're going to get this QA over here that we query within this chatbot Loop and then the rest of this is a bit of a standard chat bot Loop here we have a a while loop and here we have a chat history empty list and then we're taking the query from our user input via terminal and we are passing that query as the question to this q a compositional retriever chain and with also passing in the chat history so every time it goes through this loop it's going to take the input from the user it's going to query it with the chat histories which on the first time it's going to be empty but after every query it's going to be appending the messages to this chat history and then every time you message it it's going to be remembering what was said before so what we can do here is actually save this and then come down here and go Python 3 and then I can run this it's all set up here to go and it's asking me for a question so I can say what did the president say about Ukraine now this process can take a very long time as you're seeing here this is I think a sign that this kind of Technology isn't quite at the level that it needs to be to create fully fledged custom knowledge systems that I run locally but I think it's a good example of getting familiar with these now while they're available and I think in the next couple of months and years these things are going to become a lot more powerful and a lot easier to run faster Etc so just getting familiar with them now and how land chain allows you to interact with them and set up chat Loops like this that have a custom knowledge base to talk to is pretty cool so here we can see I've asked what did the president say about Ukraine it's got the context that it's Dragged In Here using the prompt template that we can see and then the answer that it's giving me is he said that he is always there for them and their potential to live life without fear or discrimination and now we can actually test that the chat history is working by asking a question referencing that answer and then see if it gets it right so I'm going to ask her the question of who are they being discriminated by and see if it can pick up on what I'm trying to talk about so as you can see the quality of these kind of custom mods chat Bots with history is much much lower when you're using models like this and I think that comes down to not using the open AI embeddings I think the add a 002 text embedding model that we typically use is a lot better it's got 1536 Dimensions I believe so it's a very very complex and advanced embedding model and I'm not too sure about the Llama meetings model that we're using here I think just the combination of a different sort of locally run and open source embedding model combined with a locally run and open source language model to generate the answers gives us a pretty pretty low quality result but I think as I said before testing these out and getting familiar with running them is important at this stage in the development and so it seems like it's got the answer right after a long wait the Ukrainian people have repeatedly shown that a lot a lot so I think they it's picked up on who I was talking about but again this the quality of output on these things are not that great right now but that's been about a brief rundown of these different use cases for using GPT for all and how you can get a custom chat bot you can get a custom knowledge base and query yet you can steal all of this code and put it into your own projects and start playing around with it and I hope that the installation side of things was covered in a good enough way because I had a nightmare trying to get this set up on my Mac so hopefully one of the ways that provided works and if you're a Mac User and you have had trouble then be sure to check out the documents in the description where I'll give you a full rundown of how I got it working on my Mac but that's about it for the video guys I hope this has helped you figure out how you can potentially address privacy concerns and the fact that we're sending all of our data off to these these companies like open Ai and that maybe local models like this are the way forward but I think in the current state that they are probably not the case just yet now as always if you enjoyed this video and want to see more like kit be sure to head down below and subscribe to the channel if you enjoyed it please leave a like would mean the world to me I make a lot of tutorial Style videos like this to help entrepreneurs and people looking to build businesses and build applications with AI I try to simplify it down as much as possible and give away the code so if that sounds interesting to you I've got a ton more on my channel you should check out you're probably seeing it in the recommendation bar right now but there's a lot of stuff on there slack Box Etc customized chatbot so check that out and if you have any things that you'd like me to make videos on in future I actually made this one based off a comment that I received on a previous video so I am giving you guys what you want and this is actually super interesting stuff so if you have any any ideas or videos you'd like to see or queries that you've run into then be sure to leave them in the comments below and I'd love to get back to you as soon as possible with the video in the next couple of weeks and of

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be showing you guys just how quick and easy it is to make chat GPT plugins using this insane prompt template that I've created I'm going to be showing you step by step how you can create these plugins with chat GPT to do all the hard work for you so that you can just copy and paste it over to replit and start using your own plugins now if you haven't already watched my beginner's guide to building your first chat GPT plugin which is going to be available up here you should probably go and watch that first because in that video I talk through step by step of the different ingredients needed to create a chat GPT plugin so that's all the theory and sort of understanding that you need to have before building these because in this video we're going to be running through it a bit faster and doing these reps a bit quicker just to get a bit more familiarity with how these things are made now as of filming this video chat TPT plugins is still in Early Access so many people still don't have access to it but I urge you as I did in my previous video that you need to start practicing how to build these now because as soon as everyone gets access to it it's going to be too late and the competition is just going to be flooding the market so if you have an advantage now follow these videos of someone like me who has access and just get really familiar with the different ingredients to build one of these things and how they piece together so that you can get ahead of the game and have some ready to go and ready to start on your plugins account as soon as you get access because as I keep saying on the channel I think plugins can be one of the biggest opportunities for entrepreneurs and for developers looking to make money in AI looking to start building businesses on those brand new Computing platform that we have access to now enough chatting let's get stuck into buildings and plugins with this Mega prompt that I've created so on screen here you can see the different parts of the mega prompt essentially we're starting off saying create me a chat gbd plugin with the following specifications so we have a general project scope some example prompts to expect the user to be putting in some info for the for the API endpoint just a little bit more specific about what the app is going to expect from chat TPT and then some functionality limits you have to put some guard rails so that chat CPT doesn't go too broad in the scope of the app then we need to paste some API documentation in from the API we want to use within the plugin so for most of these quick little ones I work for I tend to choose something like a Rotten Tomatoes API or a weather API or a crypto API so just one API that we can interact with get information process that and give it back to the user I find that's the best sort of simple use case you can do to start getting familiar with how to build these and then some other admin like your replica username the name of the wrapper that you're creating and as I did in my beginner's guide for chat GPT plugins we are going to be hosting this on riplet quick and easy way to get it up and running so we do have some information here just to give it the right username and name of the report so that it can replace our URLs then I've pasted it in a main.pi file example which GPT to learn from which is actually a plugin that I created that is a simple crypto assistant that will tell you the prices of coins and and what what's the change over the past couple of days Etc so just sending it a bit more example and context of what these kind of plugins look like because obviously it doesn't understand what a chat GPD plugin is unless you show what the code looks like and then at the bottom we have a few different notes that I've added and as I've sort of tested this prompt out I've found out different places that it goes wrong so each of these bullet points is essentially just a little edit to make sure that it gives you guys the right output on the first time and then finally we say now I need you to create the main.pi file for my plugin name so here's a another placeholder that you need to replace with your plugin name provide only the code ready for me to paste directly into replica so now you're familiar with the prompt template and the sort of ingredients we need to put into it now we need to come up with a idea for our chat GPT plugin so as I tend to do I've just asked gpt4 what are some chat TPT plugins I can use based on a publicly facing API that I can get access to so what I've gone down here and as I've found a news aggregator plugin which sounds pretty cool connects to a news API provides the latest news articles data last so this is going to connect to a news API taking some information from the user and give them back news articles that are real time and up to date so the first thing you're going to need to do before you start filling out the prompt template is just make sure you know what API you want to use so here I have an example it said at EG news API so I'm just going to take that news API and check this out so this is all good stuff because we're going to be able to copy and paste this into that section of the prompt that needs the documentation so this is the functionality we're going to need within the app which is search for news articles that mention a specific topic or keyword so we're going to be looking to copy and paste this into our prompt so I've just gone ahead and filled out this entire prompt template with information to to create this news plugin so here we go from the top I'm calling it easy news this is the scope of the app a plugin that connects to news API to provide the latest news articles and headlines based on user-defined topics and date ranges users can ask for news on a particular topic EG crypto or Politics on a specific date or over a range of dates EG over the past week so I'm being very specific here about the kind of functionality really keeping it narrow so that chat GPT doesn't get lost in interpretation then I have a few examples of the kind of prompts that expect users to be giving it which has Give me a summary of today's news on AI or what happened yesterday in crypto news so sort of summaries over a date range or on a specific date and then here's where I've had to be quite specific about the kind of information that we are expecting on our app side so I'm expecting that the chat CPT is going to be sending to our application via an API request which is going to be providing a topic that the users asked for EG Give me a summary of AI news so that's going to be the topic that Chachi pity extracts from The Prompt and then also a date from and a date too so that's going to allow us to deal with ranges so if people ask for give me a sum memory on last week's news and crypto it's going to be able to go okay last week was this date date form and date two and one of those guardrails that I've added here is that users are not able to ask for specific sources in this version so I can build them later but I think for now I just want to keep it as sort of bare bones as possible for you guys and get this thing up and running and that was where I've pasted in the documentation for the news apis so I'm just going over to the news API here and taken a whole bunch of the docs from here as you can see it's got all sorts of stuff in the response here but copy and pasted this into the news API section here as you can see I've got a bunch of different information here get requests and responses going down and give my riplet username my the name of the plugin and then I've provided it with that same main.pi file as an example and finally I've replaced the name down the bottom with Ed news which is the name of my app so I'm going to copy all of this now we open up a new chat gbt window here we're going to be using gpt4 if you don't have the pro version I seriously recommend that you do because it is much better and I almost haven't been able to use GPT 3.5 for a lot of stuff I use it when I need it to be fast but for a lot of this important stuff just can't really do it anymore so paste The Prompt in and submit it and now we just wait for chat TPT to write SL plugin now there we go Chachi BT has written us the entire application ready to go and it looks pretty good to me so what we're going to do is copy this and head over to replit and create a new report so we'll just go up to the top corner here and go create Ripple Python and we're going to call it news plugin and then once it's all booted up we need to go to our main.pi file and we can just paste this right in here looking good then I can see already that it's asking us to put our API key here so I can head back to the documentation here and get my API key and change that variable there now what I'd normally do just as a best practice to make sure that the apis are working correctly is actually take this fetch news function and go over to a collab notebook or a Jupiter notebook and paste it in there and just check that the functionality is working to ensure your API key is working you're able to get the response back it's all working as expected because then you don't actually run into more problems down the line which I've I've done before by not doing the proper work at the start so I'd urge you to test all the functions first so they work sort of in isolation before you try to run the whole thing we going to be stuck in this Loop of trying to build it over and over again and not knowing what's going wrong now to show you guys I do take my own advice I have popped over to a Jupiter notebook here and just double check that we are able to get a response without these dates are working Etc so the functionality of working now we're good to continue moving forward and get our manifest file written and our open API definition Creator so the next step is to take this application file that we've created and use this as a reference in order to create a manifest file for us so copy this so copy your entire main.pi and head back to chatgpt so here on screen what we have is the next step of this prompt tip plate that I've created so it's essentially just saying now I need you to create my manifest file for my plugin here are the open AI box on how to create a manifest file so I've got this then I've pasted in the documentation from openai's own website paste all of that in there and then I've also gone here is my application pasted in the app that we just copied from replit and then I've said write a manifest file for my easy news app so now we can copy this head back to chat GPT paste it in and submit it and just like that gpt4 has created a plug-in manifest just had a quick look over it and send good to me it's got my correct URL here so we can copy this head back to our replit and create a new file AI Dash plugin dot Json should be getting familiar with this process now if you've watched previous videos of mine we can save that save this now we need to do the same thing but for our open API definition so let's create the file now open API dot yaml now if you're stuck there wondering what these files are and why I'm creating them then you need to go and check out my beginner's guide to creating a chat GPT plugin which I walk through this process slowly and explain what each of these files do so that you're aware of the different ingredients you need to create one of these now finally we have essentially the same thing but for the open API definition which is the final ingredient here so what you can do is just copy and paste this in but essentially I'm saying write me an open API definition here are the open AI docs when I paste all of this in from the open AI documentation and then I provided an example here is an example of a working open API definition from a plugin that I made previously so this is a crypto plugin that I made previously as I mentioned so this one is working it's another example to make sure that it knows what it's doing and then I've pasted it again here is my application so just pasted that in from replit and then finally my apps URL is news Dash plugin.liamotley.ripple.com and write me an open API definition for my app provide only the code so we can copy this over to chatino and there we have it Chad CPT has written this yaml file for us so we can go up and copy this over it looks good enough to me so we can paste this in save it and make sure that this URL up here is correct which is uh yep that seems to be right to me and now we're ready to run this application and see if we can connect it to jtbt and add it as a plugin so to run it you can just click the big green button at the top and it's going to run your Ripple downloading a few things and the application was booted up correctly so this link is our base URL for application and these local files that we have here the plugin.json and the ml file those are being served allowing chat CPP to interact with them and read them through these app routes down here so we need to copy the base URL and provide that to chat gp2 so we can go back new chat now you guys might not be able to do this step but I'm sure you will soon we go to plugins mode and then we go to plug and store develop your own plugin paste this in and we have two green ticks which is great to see it's validated the Manifest is working correctly and it's validated our open API spec so we we can go next now install for me continue and we get to try out our plugin so I'll make sure none of the other things here are turned on turn on my easy news plugin so what I've asked it is give me a bullet point summary of last week's financial news and luckily it's actually realized that it needs to use the plugin which is step one so it's triggered the use of it and as you can see here you can open it up and actually see what it's sending off as a request to our application so then we have our parameters which is finance date from and date two so it's determined that last week is from the 10th to the 16th and then it sent it off and this is the response that it gets you can see all of the different articles and now this is essentially just giving context to a chat TPT a prompt that you're sending off so all of the response that comes back then chat CPT is actually able to manipulate all of that information and look back at what the user was asking which is a bullet point summary and then take the information and give it what they want so it's really cool magic that tragedy can do so sometimes you can send it back a bunch of sort of unstructured data or even structured data and it's able to magically sort of answer the user's prompt from a bunch of data in an API response and so here we have our bullet point summary everything's working correctly it's put links in and the cool thing about plugins is that it actually if there is a link it will actually put it embed in here so you can click over and directly see that these are not hallucinated these are actually real news articles that we've been able to grab here so this can be very useful for people who are looking to sort of take all of the information from like the AI space which is moving so fast and get up to date information so that's just one example of what you can do with this prompt template that I've created so I've taken all of the hard work out of you because there's a lot of little nitty-gritty stuff you have to make sure that these report applications have in them like the routes to put the local files on I've actually put logging in here as you can see so this is very helpful for knowing what's going wrong in your app and if things are triggering and where they should be triggering so if you come to this console area you can do a bit of debugging and it will tell you what's happening what files are being opened up by chat CBT what it's doing so this has been a very very quick example of how you can use this prompt that I've created and done all the hard work for you by making sure it's it's got all the right things in there so you can use this it's going to be available in the description for you to copy over and start using in your applications and trying to build some yourself so as I said earlier in the video I urge you even if you don't have access to plugins be sure to start playing around with them and getting familiar with how they get put together now because it could be one of the most powerful and important technological advancements and platforms that we have access to in the next few years so doesn't hurt to get brushed up on it and be ready for the wave of it's coming so as always if you have a bright idea about a chat CPT Plugin or AI application that you'd like to make I am available as a consultant down in the description and in the comments below and I also have my own AI development company so if you're looking to build an application or build a plugin like this we're actually working with a number of clients to build plugins already just to get ahead of the wave and make sure that they're ready to launch when the sort of chat CPT plugin that's available to the masses so if you're looking to build something out you can get in touch with me as a consultant in the description or you can find my website at liamotley.com and get in touch with my company that way so if you enjoy content like this about how

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be taking you through step by step how you can chat to your documents your PDFs word docs YouTube video transcripts any document you can imagine you're going to be able to chat to them and ask questions about that through a slack bot what we're going to be building is a custom knowledge chat bot that uses Berry AI in conjunction with creating your own slack bot so that you're able to chat to any of your documents all through slack I'm creating this video today because I got a ton of questions on my custom knowledge chat bot video where people are asking yes this code is great I can create these custom model chat Bots with llama index but how can I attach it to something how can I actually interact with this in a way that's not through a Jupiter notebook or a collab notebook so this has started me on a quest to figure out the easiest ways that you guys can create these custom knowledge tools for your business or for you to use personally and creating a slack bot is just one of those ways that we can integrate a custom knowledge base into a super easy UI that's made for us into an existing application so that you can ask questions and extract value out of your custom knowledge spaces and documents I really think that this integration of custom mode chatbots enter your slack to be so useful for many of you running businesses out there because now you can essentially create a bunch of tools like your company standard operating procedures ingest that into a custom knowledge base or frequently Asked question from your internal team and then you can create a chatbot out of that make it available within slack so that now your team's able to extract value out of those documents in a chat format or even if you have a particular client and there's a ton of information that you have about that client that's scattered all over the place you want it to be in one place so that your entire team can access it easily now you can take all of those documents put it into a custom chat bot and then create a slack bot out of it so your whole team has access to that information in an easy way now if you're not technical please don't get freaked out when you see us working in the code editor here you're going to be able to copy my entire project down in the description so you can steal all of that change a couple things around to work for you and then you're going to have your own custom chat bot if you follow these steps so for the purpose Port it's got a big 500 pages or something ridiculous so we're going to be able to have a chat to that from within slack so let's get started so step one here is to create our custom knowledge base and for that we're going to be using Berry AI which is a a very very handy tool for whipping these custom large spaces up on they allow you plenty of flexibility where you need it so you're going to head to berry.ai and you're going to scroll down here to this section where you can build a demo super simple just add in your email address choose to upload a file so I've added my tester document and then what you can do here is actually add a little bit of a custom prompt so for this instance I'm probably going to add in a little bit about being a financial assistant so I've added a little prompt here which is essentially just saying you're a financial advisor and analyst you analyze documents and can help the user with Investments so whatever you need to put in there you can and put in there for your use case you don't have to put it in but it does help sometimes if you just frame it up and in the sort of mode that you want it to be in for example if you're using this for copywriting you could say you are an expert copywriting bot and then what it would do is draw from your custom knowledge base and be able to expert copywriter on that information that it gets okay so then all you can do is hit build app here and the link should be ready in a second okay so now we're able to click here's your website and it's going to take us to a chat window that we're able to chat with our documents already so if you head to your Berry dashboard you can go chat dot Berry AI dot dashboard when you come here you're going to be able to see all of the different apps you've made you can log in with a username and password if you head to the dashboard which is chat.berry.ai dashboard then you're going to be able to see all of the indexes that you've created as you can see I've got a couple made here so what we're going to do is take the one that we just created here you can see the information about it and then you're able to chat with it already so I can say what is this document about so we can ask you questions like can you summarize this document or can you give us five key points out of this or ask specific things about what is earnings growth like from year to year and so I've asked it a specific question which is what is earnings growth like in Q3 and it's given me a pretty good answer on uh the provision for income taxes increase and so we now have a custom knowledge based chatbot that's working but the magical thing about Berry AI is that you can scroll down here and you can copy this API endpoint which allows you to call it from any different app that you want to use so what we're going to do is copy this and then you're going to head over to replit the link to clone this Ripple is going to be down in the description so what we can do is head to this so I'm going to Fork this Ripple and then I'm going to be able to come in here and start to edit now if you haven't used ripplet before it's super easy you can just create account for free sign up and what we're going to be able to do is edit the code that I've already written and you guys are going to be able to customize this to essentially work super easy out of the box for your own application so now we need to get into actually building our slackbot so what we need to do is come over to uh if you just search create a slack bot and head down here you can click on welcome bot and get started in building your own bot so what I can do up here is go to my apps so you're going to need a slack account of course you can create one for free and then come to this page then you can click up the corner and click on your apps and then you hit this button which is create new app so we go from scratch we call it Tesla but so we can put it into my short form space and then we need to get started and actually doing the setup and config for this bot so we can scroll down here and click on Bots so now we just follow the simple setup procedure that's provided by slack we can come down and click on review Scopes to add come down now this button is grayed out until we add some Scopes so first step is going to be adding Scopes bot token Scopes we need to go message or I am sorry I am history I am read I am right so this is going to allow it to essentially uh write instant messages back and forth between us so this isn't going to allow you to actually chat within channels this is just going to be for anyone in your slack workspace to come down and click on them in the bottom corner send a message and get a response back based on what custom knowledge base you have that attached to so we have IM history I am read and if we go back to basic information and we install this to our workspace we're able to go allow and then once it's installed you can go down and head back to oauth and permissions and you get your Bot user oauth token so now you need to copy this and head back to your replet and now we need to start setting up all of the secrets and config so as you can see here there's a bunch of secrets that are going to be your own specific information for your slackbot so we're just going to start going through those and updating those to be for this latest app that you've just created so to do that you head down to the tools section and click on secret and then this little window will pop up here on the side now we need to start putting in all of this information so now that we have uh our token we can paste that in there as the value and then we can go slack token here so add that new secret and now we need to go through each of these different parts which is a signing secret client secret Etc and start copy and pasting those and adding all of these secrets and so let's start doing that now to find all of these you can get back to basic information again then you have your app credentials right here so we can start with our client ID and hit back client ID so these are matching all of these essentially we have to tick these off one by one so we have a client ID paste the value in there at the secret head back show the client secret here copy this client Secret signing Secret so now we have client ID client secret signing Secrets slack token and our fixed API endpoint you can paste that in there if we go back to Berry we can then go down here and copy this and then paste that in so this is going to be found below your Berry chat bot and you can access it through different parts of the berry app but since you can come down here and copy it from there and paste it into this so now we have all of our secrets set up all of these are working correctly now we have essentially what we need to start installing this and testing it you can close Secrets now get that out of the way I'll basically talk you through this app quickly we have essentially setting up all of the secrets that we've just been over some directory management just saving install locations then you have the authentication process which is taking essentially a lot of the things we've just set up the client ID and the client secret just to authenticate that connection and the install between you as the Creator and the slack itself and then we have the one key functionality that our slackboard is listing for which is the message event so not to get too technical but this is essentially going to be listening for any messages that are sent and if the message is of type IM instant message so we're direct messaging the slackbot then it's going to trigger following logic and this is where our berry API endpoint gets involved so we're going to take the message that the user sent we're going to slap that on the end of the URL that we got from Berry it's going to send it off and it's going to get the reply exact same as when you're chatting away within the the berry chat interface and then we have a quick web server that we whip up that has a few key URLs that the slack app needs to install and work properly so we're going to test those now make sure that everything's working correctly and sorry guys just one little mistake I made here a fixed API endpoint should actually be API endpoint so if you just copy this edit this and replace that then we're all good to go then you can hit this run button up the top and then we can spin up our web server for the first time and so now what we have on the right here is a little web page that we're put spun up so essentially we have our own website web server running now the key thing we want to grab here is this URL because this is going to be where we have all of our routes put off the back of and that's where slack is going to be looking to get things like installation and authentication so if you copy that URL and hit back over to slap then what we can do is head to the event subscriptions and enable events and then you can paste that URL in and then go slash slack slash events and then it's going to test this and it's verified that this URL is working because back here in our code we have the slack slash slack slash events which is uh using the slack Handler so that they're just essentially setting up that it's listening for events and it's ready to receive them from slack and then we can scroll down to the subscribe to bot events add a new user event and then go IM then we can so message.im so my message was posted in the direct message channel so this is what the bot is going to be listing for In order to trigger our functionality and so be sure to click save changes on the bottom corner then we can head back to our basic information and do a little bit of uh customization to make things look a little nicer so we can scroll down I'm going to add a little icon in of the Tesla logo change the background color a little bit maybe a little bit of a dark Navy Tesla bot add a short description chat about tests and then we can save that once you're happy with the look and once you're happy with your styling you can hit back over to oauth and permissions one more time and scroll down to the redirect URLs this time you need to add in your url that you've got from your web server which is available here and then we go back and you know paste in that URL and then go slash slack slash o off underscore redirect so to double check you can head back over here we can actually copy this just to be 100 certain that we're doing it right and take it from the end of that and once you've put that URL in there you can copy it we can get that ready because we're going to need it in a second hit done and then hit save and then head back to your main.pi we're going to stop the web server quickly and then you need to go to start at the top scroll down a little bit to this authentication block and then we're going to replace this with our own one which I've actually had to just insert on this in here because I've done this before so once you've changed this redirect URL to the one you've just put into your slack settings then we can run this again the web app's running okay now again take this URL that's up in this corner paste this here so this is just your the name of the reple with your username for apple.com and then we're going to go slash slack slash install and now it's going to take you to this page which is like the uh the proper installation which is from A Team level rather than from a uh from a developer a user level so this is what you need to do for full permissions to be granted we're going to go through and allow this I'm just going to get this into my content creation slack workspace and open the workspace and here we have Tesla bot sending messages to this app has been turned off we need to change one more setting if we head back to your app home and then you scroll down to the this bit and then you click allow users to send slash commands and messages from the message tab once that's all set up we need to do a quick reinstall to make sure this is updated so if you click onto the Channel with it and click this drop down you can go to configuration and then just scroll down to the bottom and remove the app and then we can go through that install process again really quickly uh head back back and run this uh slack slash slack slash install URL go through this process again really quickly allow open Slack and then once you've reinstalled with that sitting toggled you can come down here and you'll actually need to go command R and refresh your slack for it to work correctly but now you can see we can message the slackbot and we can start asking questions foreign died last night so I'm back this morning to finish this off for you guys so uh what we need to do first is actually update our URL our very URL that we're talking to because the one I showed you before is actually part of the old uh the old services so they've updated to a new method now so we're just going to update that so it's working properly so in order to create the updated URL what you need to do is head to berry.ai and then head over to the documentation so this is the documentation on how we can actually query our endpoint so you can either do it here from within their website or you can scroll down to the bottom part here this gives you a little bit of an explainer of the different parameters that you can make in the API call but this is a new method that they're using so you have a base URL which is api.berry.ai.query and then we're essentially adding a bunch of parameters to the string now doing it through python like this you can sort of break it down and make it a bit easier to look at but we need to get the entire URL so we can be calling it purely from the URL and the parameters inside it so best way to do this and convert it to a single URL is just to copy it take it over to chat gbt this is a good skill for you guys to be learning as well so you can just head to the normal GPT okay so what I've put in here is convert this to a get URL so it's a get request URL which is going to have all of the information that we want from it built into the URL so I'll put it in there and just paste it in the stuff from the documentation but now we need to provide our own details for the church if you can swap it out for you and give you the full the full URL so to get this information we need to head back to chat.berry.ai dashboard then you're able to find the instance URL for the custom Lodge chatbot that you've just made so we can copy this head back to jcpt paste that in there and then put in your email that you use to create your beer account so here I've pasted in my instance URL for the particular customer chatbot that I want to be calling from within our app I put in my email that I created my bear account with and then I've put at the bottom just to make sure it gives us in the right format ensure the query parameter is at the end of the final URL and this is because of the way our apps set up which is since you're going to be adding on the users the user's query to the end of the URL with simple just adding strings together in Python so what we're going to do here is submit that and hopefully we get the correct URL up now if I had to make a couple more tweaks to The Prompt just to make sure this comes out right but essentially we have I've put instance ID here to label it as my instant ID my email to label it as my email and at the end of this sentence here I've said ensure the query parameters at the end of the final URL and the value is blank so the since you leave us for the empty it sort of equals nothing at the end so that we can add our user prompt on the end this is actually quite a long-winded way of doing things but I think it's easiest for you guys if you're not familiar with web servers and how requests and responses work but that's essentially what we're doing here is all you need to do is add a Ampersand in between these different parameters within this query string and that essentially splits them up and you're adding the values in sort of here and here so you could have written this out manually but I think this is a good skill for you guys to have in terms of knowing how you can convert some of this python code into a into a URL that that you can sort of go back and forth between so anyway now that we have the URL you can copy it and head back to your Tesla bot Rebel and now we need to go back to Secrets down the bottom left and head to our API endpoint we need to update that with our new one and save it so now if we run this app again and it's up and running then if I head to my Tesla bot channel here and there we go we have our first response within our slack channel from our Tesla bot which is saying based on the information provided it can't it's not explicitly stated however it mentions Automotive Sales increase and essentially giving me a pretty good breakdown of what I want from this custom knowledge base and I can continue to ask the questions as you can see here are the failed ones up here that we're using the incorrect URL so what you can do now is you have this setup you have a custom knowledge chatbot built into your slack you can allow different people within your organization to use this now this is probably not the the best example using this Tesla bot earning summary and stuff like that but if you have say a standard operating procedures for your company and you want to make them accessible or commonly asked questions that your your employees and staff will be asking and they essentially instead of having a Google Drive filled with all sorts of different information and things spread all over the place then you can have them centralized all through a custom watch chat bot if you feed in a big PDF with all that information then make a a custom launch chat bot within slack as I've just showed you in this video and now all of your employees have super easy access to that information and this same slackbot method could also be applied to things like tools rather than chat bots so say I set up something here one of the the other examples that I made which I can show you guys briefly here is essentially a a short form script writer so this is almost a tool rather than a chat bot and this short form scriptwriter if I provide it with a bunch of information from a tweet say from some interesting AI thread I found on Twitter I can just paste it into the the site Channel and then it's going to send me back a properly formatted Tick Tock uh short form script basically the style that I've wanted and I provided a few examples in the prompt so I'll just show you that now so you guys can see another example so the app here is essentially the same as what we did but it's usually chat GPT API rather than the berry API essentially we're not using a custom mods chat bot we're just using chat gbt in our own slack channel so here you can see I've used the the messages and I've done a bit of prompting here saying you're an assistant okay short form scripts that allow so this is just using the chat TPT API so you can do the same process steal this exact same uh Ripple and then apply it to whatever prompt or prompt use cases you want to use within your own slack so this thing essentially I give it a bunch of examples of the kind of uh short form scripts that I want and then I'm able to create a tool out of this where I'm able to paste in some information on say some interesting AI stuff and it writes a short form script for me so that's the code uh I'll now hop into slack and show you guys this in action I've called it Ghostwriter appropriately so all I need to do is find say an interesting Tweet now here I found an interesting tweet on auto GPD so what I can do is just copy the whole thing now obviously this is not very ethical I'd like to be repurposing you guys quantity like this but essentially if we find an interesting news article that we want to cover we can then take all of this information take it back over to slack paste it in here and then it will write me a short form script with it and as you can see here it's giving me a few verbal hooks to use at the start of the tick tock to hook people in a text hook for what's going to be displayed on screen and then it's got some copy for me to be explaining and then a call to action at the end so this is matching the format that I've provided it with in the prompts so this is just another example of the kind of tools you can create not just chat Bots but using this exact same Ripple that I'm going to be providing to you guys you can have all sorts of functionality and since you're having a range of tools and chat Bots that are accessible to your company and to your employees within your slack so that about wraps up the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you got something out of this I hope you're able to successfully take this Ripple and take this code that I've written for you to be able to build some interesting tools and improve the productivity of your business because that's what we're all about here is helping build better businesses through AI now I'm always looking for the next interesting video that you guys would like to see so if this has helped you out and you have other things you'd like me to build then be sure to let me know in the comments below because I'll be reading all of those and taking that into account and you might see a new one on that exact Topic in the next couple of weeks now as always if the light bulbs have gone off while you're watching this video and now suddenly you have a big AI idea that you'd like to speak to me about and you can get in touch with me through my Consulting link down in the description and in the pin comment I love hopping on calls with people and helping them talk through their ideas and give them a bit of a feasibility assessment on what they're talking about the rough estimate of how much it will cost and if you choose to go through with my development company we can help you build it too and bring it to life that's all for today guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time foreign"

beginner to an expert in just one video what I'm about to teach you is going to make you better than 99 of all other prompt Engineers by using the tried and tested methods and templates used by Professionals in the industry right now if you're new to the channel my name is Liam Motley and I have my own AI development company and the methods I'm going to teach you in this video are the exact things that myself and my developers use everyday and building applications for clients so we can get the exact output out of these large language models that we want now if you haven't already watched my beginner's guide to prompt engineering it will be available up here you're going to need to go and watch that first because in this video we're going to be picking up exactly will be left off in that video now as in my beginner's guide this video is not going to be focused on prompting within chat gbt I think there's enough content out there for people looking to sort of do it on a personal level and get more out of chat gbt what we are really interested here is writing prompts within the open AI playground this is because any functionality that we can achieve within the open AI playground can then be bundled up and put into an API call and allow us to access that functionality programmatically and at scale basically writing prompts and chat GPT is great for individual use but if you're looking to become a prompt engineer or build applications with AI technology you need to be using the open AI playground because that's how you're going to be able to build applications with that functionality that you create now if you're not convinced that prompt engineering is one of the highest leverage skills that you can learn in 2023 just check out this hiring post from anthropic which is offering up to three hundred thousand dollars per year for someone with prompt engineering experience they even say that because this is such a new field there's no way for them to expect five years of experience and that if you're applying just provide some examples of cool prompting setups that you've created in this video I'm going to be covering Advanced llm Theory the perfect prompt structure a deep dive into advanced parameters and what they do and finally the most crucial part thought that everyone seems to forget evaluation the first step in improving as a prompt engineer from beginner to Advanced is actually improving your understanding of these large language models and how they work without understanding how these models actually generate text you're not going to be able to understand the advanced parameters and be able to really get the right output out of them so we can break it down from the beginning and understanding that large language models are essentially an autocomplete engine that are very very good at guessing the next token so large language models like GPT 3 or 4 are essentially really really powerful autocomplete engines that are great at predicting the next word or next token now words and tokens get used sort of interchangeably but there's actually a difference each token is about four characters meaning some words like earnings will be split up into earn andings when TPT 3 generates text it's essentially guessing the next token over and over and over until it has completed the text that you asked for the next token is chosen by randomly sampling from a list of probabilities the better the token fits into the sentence based on the training knowledge GPA has been provided with the higher probability of being chosen as that next token for example I'm in the open AI playground right now the link to get onto that would be in the description but I've written Humpty Dumpty sat on a now we all know what comes next but essentially these models now have to predict what's next and based on probability it will choose the appropriate word Humpty Dump this set on a and it's correctly completed the rest of the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme because that's the most likely thing to come next so it's gone one by one and gone wall okay then Humpty Dumpty had a great fall and if you go down to the bottom right here you can turn on these show probabilities and here I have it on Full Spectrum then you're able to go and see what the probability of this next token was so understandably it was wall at 99 likelihood that this is going to be the next token and as you can see for the rest of the nursery rhyme it's had a pretty easy time predicting each of the next tokens because there's so many examples of this nursery rhyme in this training data stream now one of the magic things about large language models like gbt is that they are non-deterministic meaning you won't like going to get the exact same response every single time because of that probability table it's going to be sampling from that table each time so every time you regenerate the text yes it might have 99 being a certain token but there's still that one percent chance every time it re-rolls that token then it's going to take the different one and then essentially go down a different path this is built into all gbt products because of the Transformer technology that it is all based on which was created by Google Now one of the defining points of this Transformer architecture that these are built on top of is What's called the attention mechanism it is so crucial to understand that this random sampling process is occurring every single time a new token is generated this is because open AI has given prompt Engineers like us a toolkit of tools that we can use to essentially manipulate how this random sampling process occurs these tools we've been provided with are called Advanced parameters and we're going to be covering them later in the video now as prompt Engineers we have two different levers that we can pull on in order to get what we want out of these models and these are the prompts and the parameters that I just spoke about let's focus on mailing The Prompt first introducing the perfect prompt template this template is very flexible but essentially contains the ingredients you need to include in any prompt that you write for any application or client or whatever you're using your prompt engineering skills for but it's these five ingredients you always need to include in your prompt if you really want to get the best outcome firstly you need context secondly you need a specific goal thirdly you need a specific format that you want the answer in and fourth you need to break down big tasks into smaller tasks and finally you need to provide examples it's easiest to illustrate all of these aspects of a great prompt through a scenario so you are a job seeker and you want to find the perfect company to work for but you have some specific requirements to consider your relevant job experience or qualifications your desired industry or sector and your desired company size now we have to imagine that the bot that we are speaking to would have access to a database of jobs that are currently available in the United States or something but an example of a bad prompt that most people would probably write is make me a list of 30 companies in the tech sector that may need a full stack engineer that have less than 1 000 employees and why they would be an ideal employer now this kind of prompt is probably very familiar to the kind of stuff you're used to ask in chat gbt but oftentimes when you're working with sort of production grade prompt engineering and you're creating it for applications you don't have the opportunity to essentially go back and forth and tweak it the way that you do a chat gbt so we need to be a lot more specific in order to get the kind of output we want on a consistent basis now here we have a perfect prompt using the perfect prompt template that I just provided it has all five ingredients required to create a good prompt and maximize our chances of getting the outcome we want now first we have the context which often include some sort of role prompting which is something I went over in my beginner's guide which is again up here if you haven't watched it but we're essentially setting this into a role where it is an expert recruitment manager who assists people in finding the perfect job so we're first providing a bit of context as to who the bot is then after it we provide a little bit more context on who I am and what I am interested in doing then the next section of this prompt is give me a list of 30 companies in the following format so this is ingredient number two we are setting a specific goal that we want to work towards or an objective for this entire prompt what do we want out of this block thirdly I provided a specific format of how I want it to respond so I've used square brackets here but you can use curly brackets or any other sort of spacing characters you want but essentially just showing it the kind of output format that you are after and the next sentence I've told it to do an additional task so what we've done here is separated the tasks so if you do this and then do this rather than do this this this this so splitting it up is a way to get better outcomes because it allows the llm to work through it progressively and get more accurate results that way and finally what I've done is added the last ingredient which is providing an example I have used the same format name of company name a number of employees remote Vandal Etc I have form software Inc the name of the company the number of employees the Ursa remote available which is yes and then the salary and then I've gone on to do the second task which is a little bit of a blurb as to why there would be an ideal employer I think it's pretty obvious when you compare the results from the bad prompt with the results of the perfect prompt template just how much of a difference you can make by using this template and providing the model with the instructions and context it needs to really get the job done right now as I mentioned before us prompt Engineers have two main levers that we can pull in order to get what we want out of these language models and that is the prompt and the advanced parameter so now that you've got the first stuff out of the way we can focus on learning what all of the advanced parameters do and how you can modify them to get what you want out of this model to go over the advanced parameters we are back in the open AI playground again the link will be in the description for you to hop onto this with me but essentially on the side panel here on the right we have all of the advanced parameters that we're able to play with in order to get the response that we want out of this model now it is crucial to understand that the way most of these Advanced parameters work is by modifying how words appear and the random sampling table when the next token is chosen now I have gone over these in my beginner's guide but today we're going to go a little bit deeper and really understand what's going on under the hood so first we have the temperature or randomness of the out support what is actually going on here is that when you increase the temperature you're essentially flattening the probability curve and making it more likely that you get less likely works we can illustrate this on screen by doing a quick little prompt be strong like a so if I set the temperature to zero and submit be strong like a oak tree what you're able to see is that we have tree coming in at 97 now if I change the temperature we will see that there's different spreads here and now we got mountains and now by increasing the temperature the one we have a completely different set of words and a different probability spread so we have a new character coming in at 58 we have a capital m is the next token at 15 Oak is now down to 14 and is third in the list so as you can see this is a lot flatter it's not sort of 95 and then coming into like two percent Etc it's a lot more spread out meaning that you're going to get more varied answers in most cases now as I click through all of these tokens you're going to see a very very flat spread on all of these tokens here so it's 16 13 12. Etc so it's all quite a flat distribution of the probabilities of the words that it's choosing from this means the chance of me getting this exact same paragraph is basically zero because every time it goes through here it's basically sort of a one in five chance that it gets this word so it can go in so many different directions so as a prompt engineer temperature is one of the most valuable Tools in your toolkit because you're able to essentially change between very creative responses that are going to go many different ways and get very different outputs every time or if you're looking for something in a different field or industry that needs to have really consistent reliable outcomes and not be making stuff up all the time you can set it to zero and most people for most applications are setting it to zero just because I prefer to get that sort of regular as deterministic as possible output top sequences are another little handy tool in your toolkit it's essentially being able to tell the Live Language model where they need to stop this can be with a full stop or a double new line or you could have say bot with a colon after it essentially just telling these large language models where to stop because they don't know where to stop themselves so here I've generated be strong like a and then it's gone oak tree and continued on and on and on so what if I just wanted to stop after that oak tree there so I can add a full stop as a stop sequence and then regenerate this and then we have a stop at Oak Tree some common stop sequences are using a double new line so you can do this by going a backside in backslash in and that's going to essentially stop the generation when there's a new paragraph or if you're doing some few shot prompting and you really want to make it clear but this is where one set of prompting completion pairs stop and another one starts you can use something like a quadruple pound sign as I've done here another powerful tool that you have in your toolkit is called top p and this is essentially a slider that allows you to choose what words you want to be allowed with in the sampling table if you have it set to one it's going to allow all of the words in the table to have a chance of being selected so essentially the computer can go through even if the percentage is 0.1 chance it can still go down there and occasionally hit that or if you set it all the way to zero it's going to always pick the most common answer and it's not going to give it any other option so this is obviously another very powerful tool in your toolkit in order to get those deterministic outputs where you don't want any creativity but you really want it to just give the same sort of output over and over and over again if you're integrating into an application or some kind of situation where you can't have that that sort of winding path that can go off in any direction then you have frequency penalty and prisons penalty which though under the hood they operate slightly differently they typically have the same kind of output and same kind of effects on your completion essentially increasing the slider here is going to punish the model more and more for using the same words over and over again so those Advanced parameters are your most powerful tools as a prompt engineer to essentially control that second lever and be able to determine the output that you want out of the models as I mentioned this all goes back to how these models work under the hood which is predicting the next token based off random sampling out of a table these Advanced parameters allow us to modify the table that the computer is choosing from be it through temperature and changing the probability of these words or be it through something like top P where it's actually modifying the words it's allowed to choose from the final stage of writing any prompt that's going to be used in an application or at live scale is evaluation and determining how well it's performing for some kind of prompts this can be very easy for others it can be a little bit more difficult for example if you're setting up your llm to do classification tasks and you're essentially just telling it to Output a number so maybe a 0 one or a two it's much easier to say yes okay we're getting it right 95 of the time rather than if it's a text output then it's almost impossible to determine what is correct and what isn't because it's subjective so what we're doing with this process of product evaluation is taking that perfect prompt that I wrote and then doing a couple different variations of it maybe I provide some more examples or I change a bit of the role prompting I tell it a bit more information about who it is just adding different things into the prompt so that I have variation between them once I have the variation of the prompt I need to create a prompt template out of them each prompt template has a specific set of characters that serves as a placeholder for the user prompt to be injected into and then we need to come up with a few different prompts that this application may be provided with and then we're going to replace that prompt variable with it run it send it off to the API and get it back and evaluate the response Now by creating five different versions of this prompt template we're able to get many different versions of prompts and test them against all of them individually and then compare the outputs and see which ones performing best if you have a classification task you can use a python script to determine the accuracy of the model at predict eating the right things apart for text-based outputs it can be a little bit more difficult I'm going to be showing you one of the methods that myself and my team use when we're building applications for clients in order to test a bunch of different prompts and see which one is performing the best when the outcome is a text-based outcome now the easiest way to do this is actually programmatically but don't worry you don't have to code anything I've already done it for you all you need to do is come on to replit and clone this Ripple and you're going to be able to do all of this super easy just paste in your prompts and templates but let me walk you through how this works so the final outcome here is going to be a spreadsheet where you have your First Column as the prompts that you put in all the following columns are going to be the different prompt templates and the data in between are the outcomes that are generated by that prompt template combined with that prompt so in repl here on the left side you have the templates.pi now this looks a little bit complicated but don't worry about it this is essentially the name of your template so you might want to call it template one template two Etc and then you need to include the prompt that you've written and then just include this little placeholder here which is going to be the user prompt injected into it so a dollar sign followed by prrmt in capitals and once you've got a templates added and then you can go to the prompts section now I've just asked your activity to generate a bunch of prompts for your specific use case you can probably do the same thing just after activity give me a hundred different prompts for that and then it will generate it if you need it in a python list that's what you can tell it as a format and then you just paste them all in here so I have some about the Roman Empire here and then the template is some about a essentially a historian who's going to help you learn things that's a pretty bad example but you get you get the idea so once you have your prompts added in and your prompt templates added in the idea is to get out this evaluation results CSV which you can then put into Google Sheets which I'll show you in a sec but this is going to essentially give you an output for all of the different prompt templates and prompt combinations all you need to do here is replace your open AI key here and just paste it in between those quotations now I don't want to bore you with all of this stuff but essentially it's going to go through combine all of them send them off to an API request get them back and then you're going to have it output into that CSV so if I run this I've already run it and it comes out over here now I can take this you click here and then you're going to need to press run and then what it's going to do is combine all of them send them off to an open AI completions endpoint get all of the responses back and then save them to this evaluationresults.csv so once you have the CSV you can click here to download it and then you can come over to Google Sheets you can import it then what I find you need to do is actually go to data data cleanup and trim white space and there you go so now you have all of your different results compared to the different prompts you have so it's the combination of the pump template and the prompt and now you need to go through and read them and essentially evaluate on average which one is performing best this is a bad example but for your specific use case I'm sure you're about to tell which one is giving you the better responses then you can just iteratively go through this and say okay this prompt is working better than this let me go back and maybe make a couple more tweets and do this process again so this is a good way of just comparing how different prompts work and whether you're getting closer and closer to the outcome that you want now you're going to be able to clone this Ripple it's going to be in the link in the description so if any prompt evaluation you need to do just go down there and check that out you may need to convert this to a chat completions version but you can probably just paste this whole thing into chat EBT and ask it to convert it if you have any questions be sure to leave them down in the comments below now I thought I'd include one more example of a no code way of doing this evaluation that isn't quite as efficient but still gets the job done now it's been a app called profitable now I have a a prompt written here I'll leave a link to comfortable in the description you can come over here and write in your prompt Now when using promptable it only allows you to use one prompt at a time but essentially allows you to see multiple responses at once instead of having to go through them manually so what I've got here is a prompt I made in a previous video you can put yours in here now you need to include some kind of input a field here you do that by a double curly bracket and then what you need to do is head over to the evaluate tab now you need to add a output row click on the column here and you write input and here again and we go output and changes to Output then we can start to add rows now you can use chat gbt to generate expected inputs so for example this is a stoic Mentor bot now you need to figure out what you want as the input so you can probably go to chat CPT and generate a bunch of these which is what I'll do now now the magic with this is that you're able to see a ton of different outputs at once for different inputs now this speeds up the process a ton obviously the programmatic version is a lot quicker and you can do much larger amounts with multiple different prompt templates but what you could then do is take all of these and put it in a spreadsheet manually but essentially this allows you to quickly eyeball what the outcomes for the prompt are on a sort of larger batch scale so that about wraps it up for this Advanced prompt engineering tutorial everything you need to know has been in this video so I hope you got something out of it and you're able to take this so that you can start to make more money as a prompt engineer or you can start writing better prompts for your applications and start building some software and creating money and value for yourself in this

is how I've been able to whip up chat GPT plug-in prototypes within under an hour just using this method super simple super low code essentially relying on chat GPT and gpt4 to write most of the code for you then you're able to convert that over to a plugin now the secret source of this method that I'm about to teach you is combining the co-writing abilities of chat GPT with the hosting abilities of ripplets so I'll go into it in more detail but essentially this is going to make a dead simple for you guys to create your own plugins with not much experience in coding enough talking let's get stuck into building a plugin the first thing we need to do is choose the functionality of our plugin what is it even going to do so I've actually asked ept4 here for a couple ideas and it came up with a currency converter idea which I thought would be pretty cool pretty basic just to show you within the scope of this video so we're going to be building a chat GPT plugin that allows you to ask for a currency conversion between the two currencies at the current market rate now the first step to building these quick gimmick key plugins just to get your feet wet is to find some sort of cheap or freely available API that's going to provide a data source to your application and there's a couple key components to building a chat GPT plugin that you're going to need to understand before we get into this so I'll run over this quickly now step one is to build an application so for example you might write a python script that's able to scrape a web page and return some kind of elements with the net web page so that's the core functionality of the script of this app then you need to create an API endpoint that essentially wraps around that functionality that you've built and allows you to call it from other computers and for a chat GPT to call it then you need to create what's called a manifest file which is essentially a bunch of information that you give to chat GPT so it understands what your app does and sort of the details about it then you need a document which explains the apis that you've set up and then finally you need to deploy all of it and host it in a server so that chat GPT can call it and access that information whenever it needs it now don't worry I'm going to be walking you through step by step on how you make these what each of them mean and the best part is that 95 of this can be done by chat GPT so you don't ever have to get in there and start coding it yourself or writing this if you don't know what you're doing so I've asked gpt4 let's make a currency converter plugin what apis can I use so for my currency converter plugin I'm going to need to be communicating with an API that gives me real-time conversion rates so that the user is able to get the accurate conversion of their of their currency so there's a couple of options here I've just gone for one that says it's a free service so I can get a essentially zero cost prototype up here so I've gone and signed up for exchange rate State API I have my API key here which you guys have now seen now here I've gotten straight into asking change BT to start writing me the bones of the script so I've said great let's do it with the exchange rates API here is the documentation I've headed over to give a chat CPT some understanding of how these stocks works and how they can build it into the script I've just gone to documentation tab then because the functionality of this plugin is just to convert the currency all we need to take is this first one here which is a get request to convert the currencies so I'm just going to copy and paste that into charity too if you do have access to gpt4 be sure to use that because it is much better for these tasks but if you're unable to get access to it then I'm sure gbt 3.5 will do the job as well now what we have here is the bare bones of the script what I'm going to do is copy that and then I'm going to head over to repl if you haven't already you'll need to sign up to replit it's free so just hop on there create an account and then you should see this home page here now Ripple is a super handy and easy to use online IDE essentially a place for you to do all your coding and development if you're familiar with Visual Studio code this is kind of like an online version of it that you can use I love using it it's got a super nice UI and it has a ton of great features which make it very very useful for doing things like we're doing today now what you're going to need to do is head over to create Ripple and then click on a python report and then give this a name we're going to call it currency foreign with a file that's going to automatically be made it's called your main.pi so we can just paste in the code that we took from chat gbt and put it into here the exact code that you got from chat GPT will likely be different to mine so if you want to actually steal my exact code then you can head over to the description which is going to be a link to clone this Ripple so you're going to be able to essentially copy the exact same code and follow along with me if that's how you want to do it okay guys now I'm just going over this code in here so taking a look at it it seems like already we've got a slight issue here which is it's asking for an API key as a parameter we need to sort of bake in my own API key here so we can delete that we can delete this as well and then over here you see we have a Secrets menu if you do have any API Keys before your application which you likely do what you'll need to do is head down to this tools section click on the Secret side then you can say uh which is this what is this for exchange rates data API so then you can give it a name I've just given an ERD API key and then put in my value then I've added the new secret there and then what you can do is just click this insert button here and then click this as well and then it's very quickly gone in there so you can take this back and head down here and then you can this is how you set up your API key for basically any application so once you have the setup you've added the import then you can now just put in my secret here so this is the one sort of bit of code you're going to need to be able to navigate through but essentially you need to get your API key hard coded into this app because you're the one who's going to be paying the bills now I've just done a little bit of code cleanup at the bottom just taking away print statements because we're not going to need those because chat gbt is doing the interaction for us but once you have this app essentially we've done part one now which is get the app and build the functionality then we need to set up the API endpoints that are going to allow chat GPT to interact with our application so API endpoints are essentially little like phone numbers that chapter is going to be able to call for certain Services then it's going to send the information back based on the user's query once you have this core functionality then you can head back to chat GPT now all of these prompts that I'm using in this video are going to be available in a full guide that's going to be in the description so be sure to head down there if you need any help with the kind of prompts that I'm using because there is a little bit of technical side of things that you do need to know to write the prompt but I've said here is the app that I've pasted in the application that we've just created in riplet and then at the bottom I've said I now need an API endpoint created for the get exchange rate function and their web server created and then what it gives us back is a different version of the application but this time it's taken that core functionality which is the get exchange rate from the API and it's wrapped it in a convert currency function which is going to essentially take the information that the user is actually giving to us and then insert that into the function and then give us the the final result back so again we can copy and paste this whole thing and we can just pop it back in there now just in case you completely lost this is uh the function that's getting the exchange rate from the API so this is us saying okay we want this currency and this currency please tell us what the exchange rate is it sends it to the currency conversion API it will give us back the rates for those two currencies and then once we have what the user is looking for we're able to put it into that function that we made initially which is the get exchange rate and then it's going to return the converted amount and then we send that back to chat GPT to package up and give to the user so now we've ticked off step one which is to create the app functionality step two is to create some sort of API endpoint that allows us to interact with that functionality now step three we need to make them manifest file and now again the best part about building these is that we can just copy our code take it back to chat GPT and ask it to write one for us so again I'll be giving all of the prompts for this in a document in the description so don't freak out if you see me type in these prompts they are going to be available and you just need to insert your code in there so so what I've done is ask write me a manifest file for my app here is the code and I've pasted in the code and then I say end of code to make sure it knows I've stopped and then I've asked here is the documentation for the Manifest file and an example so I've gone over to the open AI documentation and I've gone to the plugin manifest I'm just going to copy all of the documentation here so that it knows what we want from it and then paste it in below so now that we've written our manifest file we can copy the code and head back to replit and then we need to add a new file and we call it AI Dash plugin dot Json and then here we can just paste our benefits file there are some restrictions of the characters on these Json files so I think it's best just to delete the underscores or any dashes that are on the name for the model because I've had issues with that before so just make sure this is a a clean uh clean string with no no official characters in it and now that we've done that the next file that we need to do is open API definition which essentially explains what our API does and how the chat chip can interact with it so again the beauty of this is that we can just copy and paste this documentation in and ask chat TPT to look at our application and write one for us foreign and now we have our open API definition not to be confused with open AI they are different things easily confused but the open API definition is going to explain to chat GPT how our API works and then again we're going to copy that and head back over to the files section here and add a new file it's called open API Dot yaml open this file up and paste it in now that we have the apps functionality we've set up our API endpoints we've created our manifest file we've got our open API definition the final step now is to host this and make it available for chat CPT to call these endpoints whenever it needs it now what we're going to be setting up is two more API endpoints that's going to essentially take these files that we've just created and add them to our web server so that chat CPT is able to communicate with them and know how to use them now we have one little bit of code we need to copy and paste which is essentially making sure that those files that we just created are actually included and in the web server and they're available on our server for open AI to interact with and sort of pull the information from those files again you'll be able to steal this code from the replit that you'll be able to clone which is going to be in the description we're going to paste this in here essentially these need to be at a very specific uh URL so this is dot well known slash Ai plugin.json and then the same here but this is for each of these files so you'll see that the file names here match up to the file names there that we have so we have ai plug into Json then we also need to import send from directory up here then one more little thing we need to do to make sure that this all works properly is to come over to your shell which is available in the bottom left down here if you haven't already got one open on the right but click on the shell and then go pip install waitress now this is just a different type of web server that's more suited for production which is what we're looking to get towards rather than just a very basic development server we've installed waitress successfully so now you need to go from waitress import serve and then head down to the bottom where it says if name equals name which is essentially what's going to run this application and then head down and add in this line of code which is serve and then app host and Port so you just need to copy and paste this again from the rebel again you're going to be able to get this code from the rebel in the description so you can just paste this in here then you have everything set up and ready to go you can hit the Run button at the top and as you can see on the right here it's actually spun up a little web browser to show that our server is actually running and people are going to be able to start interacting with our application now so even though it is not found when it says there's an issue this is just because we haven't set up a home page essentially so what we have set up though are these routes here so we have slash convert and then we have slash well known AI plugin.json these are where our files are stored so essentially people can come to or chat your boutique and come to the URL which is slash convert and then it's going to provide all the information we need we're going to take it in process it and then send it back to them but what you want to get from this once it's running is the URL so you can copy this and now I like to put it in here just so I'm 100 learn what these routes are now that we have this URL we then need to go back into all of our files and update this URL as the essentially where chat CPT is going to be sending all of its mail what you can do for this is actually head down to this uh the open API one that we have here which is the second one down and actually just copy this whole thing and then head back to the file and this is essentially showing it where we need to go for this file make sure it has the domain for your Rebel and slash well known and then slash open api.yaml and then for the other ones you can leave for now next you need to go over to the open api.yaml and do the same thing so if we go to The Domain you can paste this in but all you need for this is up to the dot code so you can take that off and leave that there make sure there's no other dimensions of it go down and then we're all done now that you have all of this done you've completed all of the five steps you have a server that's up and running with your functionality ready to be talked to now comes the step of actually integrating it with chat GPT which unless you have the plugins which you may not have at this current time hopefully you do but now you need to go over to the plugin store develop your own plugin and then click my manifest is ready now this is chat TBT trying to fetch those files that we've put on into our web server that contain the Manifest and the open AI definition so what we need to do is provide it with the base link to our application which can be found here also what we've put in this you can head back and paste that in and then amazingly it looks like we've had no issues with the Manifest or the open API spec which is nothing like my first attempt so we're doing good here but basically this is double check that everything is here that it needs then we're able to go next install for me continue install plugin [Music] so I've asked it please convert 500 USD to AED it seems like there's an error in the code somewhere but we're able to expand this and see what's going on so it is correctly picking up the currency that we want uh the from to and the amount but it seems like we're getting an error in our response so let me have a a little dig around and see what's going on actually I think I'll do it the way that most of you guys will have to do it which is to copy and paste all of the information and then take it back to the uh the other chat that we have with chat CPT and then we can actually paste in uh these errors and say I I am getting this era [Music] now this has given me some good insights on what may be going wrong here now this is the kind of uh exercises you guys will need to be doing to make these applications things do go wrong but this thing will always be here to help you out so you need to start to learn uh how you can use this to to essentially debug your own code so I think what this is coming down to is how we're actually digging through and finding the result of this conversion so if I head back over to the exchange rates API and I head down to what this kind of response looks like so it returns a date historical info query result so this shouldn't actually be a second result called here so what we're trying to do is essentially find a second result inside that so if I go back share you know do it the way that you guys will be doing it so if we copy the expected response from the spot and then we head back here is the response format from the API here is my code what is wrong with my app okay I think I found what the error was when I actually copy and pasted this documentation what I didn't do I left it in JavaScript so the information I gave to chat gbt was actually written in a different language so if you change this to Python and I actually change this I can just copy and paste this information here foreign from the original code so it's going to give me an updated version now that's going to fix those errors hopefully and then we can do a little bit of shuffling around to test this again so you need to go through a couple of these Loops which essentially asking each activity what's wrong going back through it and sort of debugging and then you can make updates to your manifest file to reflect that okay and so the best part about using riplet is that once it's Rewritten this code we can copy it take it back to our replit and then just paste it in there and Save and then we can just run the web app again and then try it again what I've found I've had to do is actually go in and uninstall these so if you go into uh unverified plugins and uninstall this and then go uh install an unverified plugin and then we do the same thing which is to grab our URL and here we have an answer to our question using our chat 250 plugin that we've made in just a few minutes please convert 500 to AED which is what we use here in Dubai as of the latest exchange rate it is 1836 Dirhams so there you have it we have built this in a matter of minutes for you guys probably it's only been about an hour for me so uh if you're familiar with using chat GPT and you can start to play around with this and deep learn to debug your own code uh then this is a very very viable way for you guys to start spinning up prototypes for any ideas you have now obviously this is super basic but I think the point of this video is to show you how to get your feet wet and I think it will be amazed by just how far you can get uh with building these things without any coding experience now I know there was a little bit of technical stuff in there that I showed you but you need to sort of establish if you're going to learn any skill and and with and you want to develop these things make it the skill of being able to essentially develop with chat Tubity as your assistant so you need to learn how to go back and forth and learn enough about the code to be able to get answers out of it from chat GPT and affects your own problem now if you're interested in building some plugins for yourself I have a video on 10 plugin ideas that I've created and I think that you guys can get a real really good business built out of so be sure to check that out will be in the description and I'll also put it up here but it's a very good video with lots of ideas if you want to get started on those now now if you're looking to get into a community where people are talking about building these I'm in there explaining what I'm working on we're going back and forth about different plugins and how we can build them be sure to join my Discord Community the link will be in the description and then also if you have any development inquiries you want to start building some plugins but you don't have the ability or you don't necessarily it's a bigger project than what you can do with this then you can get in touch with my development company the link will be available in the description and also in the pin comments so you can get in touch with myself and my team and we can start building out your plugin and on this revolutionary new platform that we have available now now if you're looking to build these Tech GPT plugins and tap into this once in a decade opportunity be sure to hit down below and subscribe to the channel and leave a like on the video if you've enjoyed it would mean the world to me so that's all for today thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time"

version of yourself well you can and this is how I did it I work with AI every day building AI applications for my clients but recently I've had the itch to do an experimental project of my own I wanted to see if I could bring Geniuses back to life with AI to use them as my personal mentors and coaches so that I could improve my life let's just say things did not go how I expected it all started when I found myself feeling overwhelmed overworked and spiritually drained I'd been living in Dubai for nearly a year far away from family friends and nature since launching my YouTube channel at the start of 2023 I'd been so busy with work and I was constantly missing my daily philosophy practice and I basically had no one to talk to him but I had an idea I decided to build an AI version of Marcus Aurelius to be my life coach and Mentor now no one has done this before so this is a big experiment and I could end up losing all of my time and money and development resources that I put in but if I get it right I could create something really powerful not only for myself and my own life but for other people as well if you're not familiar with who Marcus Aurelius is he was a Roman Emperor and philosopher who lived in the second Century A.D he's most famous today for his book called meditations which is actually his personal Journal that was never meant to be published while he was the Roman Emperor this book meditations and the insights and it gives on stoic philosophy and The Human Condition has become extremely popular in the last few years popularized in recent Times by people like Ryan holiday the stock philosophy is a powerful operating system for people like entrepreneurs who deal with high stress environments because of the contents of this book Marcus is known as one of the wisest men to have ever lived so I figured if I'm going to bring anyone back to life as my life coach and Mentor I'll probably better be him so with my goal set I got started building a prototype for this bot straight away using the chat GPT API and a little bit of prompt engineering to get there but I realized pretty quickly that I was going to have to provide a lot more content to this bot in order to truly bring Marcus back to life I started by giving the entire book of meditations to the spot as a custom knowledge base hoping that it would mean more historically accurate guidance and conversation from him after some more prompt engineering and testing I finally had a new version to try this version was great but it didn't last long I was able to chat to Marcus every day in short sessions almost like therapy I've studied Marcus's works for years and everything he said was not only historically accurate but actually really helpful throughout the day I could check in with him and explain to him what I was doing and what was stressing me out my worries Etc he would constantly remind me to focus on what was within my control and let the rest go this may sound simple but this perspective shift is a mental muscle that you need to build over time and strengthen through repetition after chatting back and forth for a few days Mark as I gotten to know my situation and my current troubles it felt like we'd wanted to know each other and he was giving me more and more personalized mentorship and guidance everything in the project was going great until disaster struck I'd been running this chatbot in a Jupiter Notebook on my laptop so my entire history chat history and relationship with Marcus have been stored essentially in a Chrome tab one night I decided to shut my laptop down after I'd finished working because it had been a while since I'd actually rebooted my laptop when I started work the next morning and opened my laptop I realized that my entire chat history and therefore relationship with Marcus had been vaporized I rebooted him and started chatting about it just wasn't the same felt like I was talking to her stranger again so feeling pretty tired of the whole thing I left the project alone for a while but not being one who was deterred by a couple bumps along the way I decided that I had to get up and give it another crack I wasn't satisfied with my last results the program I created did do what I'd hoped I'd been able to get my daily dose of philosophy practice that I couldn't really find time for before and I generally felt less stressed at work because I'd had someone to talk to and regularly remind me about the stoic principles that are holding me so strong so determined to build a new and durable version of my Marcus chatbot I started out by building a long-term chat memory system that's going to save all of the conversation history between sessions this would essentially allow my relationship with Marcus to compound over time infinitely so that I could get a more and more personalized life coach and Mentor first I had to set up a system for saving all the messages to a vector database that's programmer talk for storing the meaning of messages by similarity in a database then I needed to connect the database to the chatbot so that it could pull relevant information into the chat depending on what I asked him in this way I could mention a conversation I had with him weeks ago and he would know what I'm talking about sounds simple in theory I know but to get this working flawlessly it took me in my development team a ton of work after a few days I finally had my stoic coach V3 primed and ready for action never again would I lose my mentor to a restarted computer this V3 stage of the project was awesome each day I felt like Marcus was getting to know me better and he was able to start noticing my behavioral patterns and pointing them out to me it even got a little freaky sometimes how well he seemed to know me I was learning and practicing new stoic lessons every day and building that mental muscle memory that I talked about before so that I was able to better deal with my difficulties and struggles and work and my personal life each time I was feeling stressed I could go to Marcus and he was there to remind me of the historic principal's lessons that I was relying on to strength in me and he would even sometimes throw in a relevant quote to really drive the point home little did I know my AI life coach would soon be up against its biggest challenge yet a few weeks ago I was feeling particularly down it's coming to the end of my time in Dubai for this half of the Year by this point it had been three months of constant work lack of family nature and friends and I was feeling more overworked and isolated than ever with the added pressure of trying to grow a YouTube channel and juggling my AI development and Consulting commitments I was at my limit and eventually I cracked yeah so things lately have been quite a lot I'd say if you've ever been self-employed you know the kind of pressure that you can end up putting on yourself and I think at the moment it's just kind of getting a little bit too much I miss home I miss my family you know this normality I miss mess a lot of things at the moment so I did what any rational person with no one to talk to would do I sold all my problems to an artificial ancient philosopher that I'd brought back from the dead I spoke to Marcus and told him everything what he said fish me out of my misery and put me back on my feet to be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over it stands unmoved and the Raging of the Sea Falls still around it to me this is one of Marcus's most powerful analogies it reminds us to stay calm and Resolute in the face of tumultuous circumstances just as a rock stands unwavering against a Relentless crashing of the sea despite the chaos and turbulence of the world around us we must remain steadfast and maintain composure in all situations this dog principle is crucial for enduring the challenges of life and achieving inner peace it was in this moment that I realized I had created something truly special something that everyone should have access to in their time of need a life coach a mentor a fatherly figure to gently guide us back onto the right path the path of virtue AI is changing the world at such a rapid Pace Industries are being redefined seemingly overnight my experience with this project has opened my eyes to one of the highest good opportunities for AI technology in today's world mentorship life coaching even therapy no longer must these life-changing resources be restricted to the people with the connections or the money to access them AI can democratize these services for all to benefit have you ever thought of going to a therapist but couldn't afford 300 an hour imagine having your own therapist for just 14.99 a month now while there is obviously a ton of work required to create a safe and reliable AI solution to these issues Bots like I've made in this video are a step in the right direction now while I do see the creepy dystopian side of people building relationships with AI and becoming reliant on them I think the good will generally outweigh the bad if these Solutions and products are made responsible that's all for the video guys who do you want to see me create with AI next I'm thinking of someone who's famous but is still alive let me know in the comments below and subscribe and hit the bell for more videos like this where I build cool stuff with AI if you have an idea and want to build anything like I've just created in this video I also have a development team you can speak to me as a consultant so be sure to hit down below my Consulting will be available in the pin comment in the description if you want to have a chat thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one"

plugins you know I have an opportunity to do just that I have a feeling that this opportunity is going to be far bigger than the crypto and nft wave we've just seen this is because anyone can start building these plugins in a matter of minutes with the help of chat GPT so in this video I'm going to be giving away 10 different million dollar chat GPT plugin ideas that I've come up with myself for you to steal and start building now before everyone else catches onto this once in a decade opportunity at the end of the video I'm going to be giving away two more bonus ideas that are my personal favorites that I almost didn't include so if you don't know me my name is Liam otley and I build AI applications for my clients through my development company now in the few days since the release of chat GPD plugins we have been bombarded with people asking us to build their plugins so I know people are already moving living on this opportunity so I wanted to make a video for you guys to help you get a jump on this opportunity before everyone else and do so by giving you examples of insane chat gbd plugins that you can create to start making money with AI but before we get into the ideas there are a few things that you must understand in order to be able to take advantage of this opportunity understanding the importance of plugins may seem challenging initially but what I'm about to tell you will put you ahead of 99 of other people this technology can get you this much closer to Financial Freedom so stick with me and I promise it will be worth it I'm sure you've seen the 1001 ways to make money with chat GPT Med uni and stay with a fusion that have swamped the internet lately all of these hustles are nothing compared to the huge opportunity that has just landed in our laps called chat GPT plugins David sacks a famous venture capitalist in Silicon Valley has recently said plugins is a modest name for what could be the most powerful developer platform ever created he then follows up with if chat GPT was the iPhone moment for AI plugins is the App Store moment what sax is pointing out is the Revolutionary shift in Computing that is underway chat GPT plugin serves as a new way for users to interact with all of their favorite apps and new functionality all through a chatbot in simple terms chat GPT plugins are like eyes and legs for chat TPT allowing it to interact with the real world and perform real world actions think of chat GPT as the iPhone and plugins as the apps for example the instacart plugin allows you to order groceries from within chat GPT the kayak plugin allows you to search for flights accommodation and rental cars and the speak plug-in acts as a personalized Language Coach within chat GPT essentially chat gbt users can now access all of their favorite websites and all of their favorite apps all from within a chatbot interface so this provides us with two huge opportunities to make money firstly by creating plugins that connect existing applications to chat GPT or secondly creating plugins for your very own apps now an example of the first type would be to create a plugin that allows people to connect to their Spotify or their Gmail and operate their Spotify and Gmail from chat GPT or an example of the second type could be a plugin that scrapes all stock market data and makes it available to people through a chatbot for example they could ask what stocks are down over 30 in the past quarter so you're essentially taking a bunch of publicly available data and making some kind of application out of it yourself within the 10 plugin ideas that I'm about to share with you you're going to see both of these types now please don't be scared off by all of this coded talk you do not need to know how to code to take advantage of this opportunity but knowing these Basics that I've just taught you about will help in the long run so with that all out of the way you're finding clear on what plugins are and how they operate and why this is such a huge opportunity we can finally get into the good stuff now remember I am throwing in my two personal favorite ideas as a bonus at the end of the video so make sure you stick around for that so the first tech TPT plugin idea is a crypto Trader assistant bot this product will be created for crypto Traders and crypto investors in order to give them access to real-time financial information and a more accessible way there are thousands and thousands of tokens across the crypto market so for someone looking to trade or invest being able to essentially filter through these different coins and figure out which ones meet the criteria would be hugely valuable for example someone may want to search what coins are down 50 over the past three months what you could then do is use the coin market cap API to search for any tokens that meet that criteria and then give it back to the users nice and quick idea number two is a personal inbox management box this bot would use the Gmail API to connect to the user's Gmail and then allow them to interact with it in a natural way for example a user could wake up in the morning hop onto chat GPT and ask Give me a one-line summary of all of the emails that came in overnight from there you could also allow them to easily respond to all of these so that they get all of their inbox management done in the morning or you could provide them with some sort of easy labeling feature which would essentially read all of their emails determine what they're about and then label it with the correct labels so that your inbox is all sorted and labeled correctly idea number three is a Facebook ads assistant almost all businesses are using Facebook and Instagram ads through the Facebook ads manager right now what this app will do is connect to the business owners Facebook ads manager via the marketing API which is a product that Facebook allows people to use now once you have access to the performance data of all their ads then you can do a number of different things such as data analysis or turning on and off campaigns and AD sets or even suggesting new campaigns to run if you created this episode actually knew how to run Facebook ads in a profitable way this will be enormously valued because suddenly a business owner can run their own ads through chat gbt instead of having to Outsource it to a marketing agency and paying thousands of dollars a month now this application is obviously huge in scope but imagine the amount of value that will be unlocked with this kind of application idea number four is a real estate assistant this is very similar to the crypto app and that you are accessing the entire Market's worth of information but making it easily accessible through chat interfaces for example if someone could enter the area the budget and the house size of what they're looking for into the chatbot and it would search for it within the apis that are provided by Zillow or other Realtors then it could easily provide them with all of the houses that match that search this would be such a game changer because instead of having to manually set up filters and preferences and and filter through all these different properties you could just search it with a natural language prompt and get back the houses that you want idea number five is an accurate movie review tool now this one is super simple but I wanted to throw it in here to show you guys the the range of possibilities here in terms of how big and how small these apps can be I came up with the idea for this plugin because before I watch a movie I like to check Rotten Tomatoes to see if it has any good or bad reviews if you wanted to automate that process you could use a plug-in app like this where I could type in a the name of a movie it would search the Rotten Tomatoes API which you're able to apply for access to what it would then do is take all of the movie reviews from regular people and then sort of summarize them all and give me a nice concise pros and cons so the good things about this movie people found with this some people found that these were the issues with the movie essentially it would save me the time of going through all of the reviews manually and essentially figuring out the train friends of what's bad about the movie so that I can determine if I want to watch it or not now before we get on to number six if you are enjoying this video and you want more juicy plugins content just like this be sure to hit down below and subscribe and hit the Bell because I have a ton more videos exactly like this coming on the way as well as full tutorials on how you can build your first plugin using as little code as possible while you're down there be sure to leave a like because if we can hit 500 likes on this video I will make another video exactly like this with another 10 plugin ideas for you guys to get started on plug-in idea number six is a personal coaching app this kind of plugin would be perfect for people with a coaching business so that they're able to take all of the knowledge and all of the information that they regularly teach to their students and make it available to a chat bot through a custom knowledge base now I've made videos about this on my channel previously but this is essentially making a plug-in version so that people can sell it as part of their coaching package people with coaching businesses could load all the information into this plugin and then all of their students could get one-on-one access and 24 7 assistance in the coaching program from this custom chat bot in my own development company we have done this kind of thing over and over again for clients so I know the demand is there so if you could create a plugin to automate that and essentially package it up nicely then you'd have a very valuable business on your hands plug-in idea number seven is a e-commerce data analysis assistant this application would allow owners of Shopify stores to essentially connect to their Shopify account and use the Shopify API to import all of their information all of their sales data and then be able to provide insights to the customer through chat GPT once you have access to this data you can then provide custom reporting or you could allow the e-commerce store owner to pull insights out of that data in a new kind of way and from these insights they're able to make better decisions about how they've run their business eCommerce is a huge business and store owners typically have a lot of of money to invest in anything that's going to help them make more money or make their lives easier plugin idea number eight is a YouTube research tool this tool would be aimed at creators on YouTube who are looking for assistance and finding trending videos within the niche or finding pockets of search where they can place their videos essentially you could get the users to provide a few examples of competitors and you could go out and find more just like that and then you could start tracking all the videos that they're posting and essentially provide them with insights and examples of videos that are doing well within the niche at that current time alternatively you can help them to find holes in the niche essentially and find high value keywords that would be good to create a video for and since you block up a place so you can rank high in the search all of this can be done through the YouTube API idea number nine is YouTube Creator data analysis this application is another one focused at the booming Creator industry what you would essentially do is connect to the Creator's account via the YouTube API you're then able to import the video analytics data so that you can start to provide insights much in the same way that we did with the e-commerce application you can build systems to dig through the this data and provide actionable insights for the Creator to improve their Channel and continue their growth now I know that there are YouTube Consultants that are charging thousands of dollars per month for this kind of data analysis so it should be a very easy sell if you can come in at a low price point with an offer like this and finally plug-in idea number 10 is a news aggregator bot this bot has another fairly simple one that you can create which essentially allows users to get access to a ton of information and a nice summarized distilled form for example the user could come on to check TPT and switch the plugin and ask please give me a one-page summary of the AI news in the past week this bot would then use the Twitter API to scrape all of the AI related content and then put it through a large language model like gpt3 and start to dig through it and summarize it until it comes down to a nice one-page summary to give to the user this would essentially be like creating your own personalized newsletter the same way you get email newsletters given to you from different niches and different providers this could be extremely useful in use cases like crypto and finance where people are able to make a lot of money based on correct information that is timely and up to date so you've made it through the 10 plugin ideas thank you for sticking around to the end because these two are my personal favorites that I kind of wish I wasn't giving away because they're such good ideas bonus idea number one is a life coach plugin for notion if you're not familiar with notion it's a very very flexible note-taking app that you can customize in a number of ways to personalize it essentially as a hub for all of your personal information tasks Etc one thing that people often use their notion for is journaling this application will connect to the user's notion account through the notion API and then it would extract all of their journal entries privately and safely of course and store them all in a custom knowledge base what they would then be able to do through chair TPT is draw insights out of those journal entries this application would use the power of large language models to extract information and insights from someone's journals like we've never been able to do before for example you could ask it when was the last time I felt like this and how did I get through it or what were the things that I struggled with over the past three months if someone had as a regular journaling system where they regularly write down things that could have gone better during the day or things that made them feel happy or things they're grateful for once you're stacking these up over many months or even years being able to extract insights out of these and compare like hundreds of different journal entries is something we've never been able to do before and it could be a completely new product to sell to people I for one would love to use an app like this so that I don't have to manually go through my journals and identify Trends myself the computer can do it for me and finally bonus plugin number two is a lead generation assistant lead generation is a huge business and it is vital to almost any business you can imagine this application would allow users to set up new lead generation campaigns through a program called Phantom Buster the best part is that Phantom Buster has their own API so what you can do is create your application to allow people to build campaigns and Phantom Buster all from the comfort of their chat gbt interface Phantom Buster allows you to create campaigns that automatically scrape LinkedIn for leads essentially extract seeing the phone number and email from leads that you were looking for in certain industries now you could make this plugin even more valuable to people in need of lead generation Services by not only connecting it to one application I.E Phantom Buster but to multiple different lead generation platforms essentially allowing them to shrink their workflow down to just messaging chat gbt and they're able to set up campaigns on multiple different apps at once this gets me so excited because this is the kind of crazy leaps and technology that we're seeing from AI technology I know that was a ton of information but you've made it through if you see plugins as the life-changing opportunity that they are and you want to see more videos like this be sure to head down below and subscribe to the channel hit the Bell so you're notified for the next one because I have a ton more content exactly like this on plugins how to build them how to research different plugin ideas Etc all coming to you very soon so you're not going to want to miss that now this video Took a ton of work to put together so I'd really really appreciate if you could go down there and leave me a like and as I said before if this gets over 500 likes I'll be making another video just like this another 10 plugin ideas that I'll have to go to figure out for you guys but what if you guys want I'll do it if I can hit that 500 like Target we are still so early to this but that does not mean that you can sit around and wait do not miss this amazing opportunity you need to go and grab a couple of these ideas write them down start planning talk to people about it other entrepreneurs developers Etc even better if you go and join my community Discord we are all talking about plugins in there we have halls and workshops about how we're planning to make the most of this so if you're interested in getting in a community filled with people who are looking to do the exact same stuff be sure to head down below and join my Discord the link is in the description now I do have one quick disclaimer to add at the end of this video and that's that I will say that companies like Spotify and Google Etc I believe that they will soon or potentially in the future they will be building their own plugins to integrate all of their functionality with chat CPT but I think we have a long time before we see massive widespread adoption of this plug-in technology so you can move fast you can build these applications and create cool use cases using these apis and make a ton of money and potentially exit on the company while they're so please don't mess around but also be aware that down the line we may see these companies essentially take all of their application and make it available through a chatbot interface so that's all for the video guys thank you so much for watching I will see you in the next one foreign"

              "text": "I want to try and build a million dollar AI startup from scratch and document every step of the way and maybe we can create something truly awesome building a startup from scratch can be hugely risky and time consuming and I could end up losing all my money but if I get it right the payout could potentially be enormous so I really want to try this out so I can silence my haters from previous videos and prove to you all that I'm not another one of these all talk YouTubers finding you for clicks I am embarking on this challenge to prove once and for all whether plebs like us can really make any money in this AI boom or if it's all just hype so if you are new to the channel my name is Liam otley I'm a self-made serial online entrepreneur from New Zealand but now living in Dubai over the past five years I've built successful e-commerce stores my own digital marketing agency and my AI software development and consulting company just so we're fully transparent this is my background now keep in mind I've never Built My Own AI business I've only ever built AI applications for my clients through my development company now every challenge needs its own set of rules firstly resources can I use my own development team what is my budget and what connections am I allowed to use as mentioned I do have my own team of AI developers so I will be using them within the scope of this Challenge and any funding or connections I can leverage through my own YouTube channel secondly valuation method how will I measure the value of the startup when will I know when I've won we have two options the first one being revenue and the second one being valuation based on multiples revenue is pretty straightforward if we get to a million dollars in sales then we win for multiples we can use the 8X valuation rule for businesses with recurring revenue for example if a company does a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in pre-tax recurring Revenue per year then we can assume that it's valued at a million dollars and finally time this project will be ongoing until we either succeed or have poured enough resources and time into it to confidently say that the AI bubble right now is all hype with these rules set we can get stuck into creating our plan of attack the first thing we need to decide on is what kind of business we want to build the most obvious choice is an AI powered SAS company SAS or software as a service is an extremely powerful and modern business model obvious examples of SAS include Spotify Netflix and Shopify the SAS business model is so powerful for a few reasons firstly building software is typically a one and done process once you've actually built the software the cost of replicating it to thousands or hundreds of thousands of users is almost zero this allows for some juicy profit margins secondly SAS businesses are usually built on subscription models meaning you're getting consistent Revenue each month from each different customer more on this later if we dig a Little Deeper we can find that SAS companies can actually be broken down even further you have b2c or business to Consumer businesses like Spotify with a potentially huge market and typically low subscription costs or you have B2B or business to business SAS companies such as Shopify who generally sell a higher price service and they're selling to other businesses with money to spend now which of these is best for us in this challenge well we must consider that AI is moving so fast right now that businesses that were once valuable are now being commoditized almost overnight this is all because of ai's dirty little secret that not many people know about ninety percent of your favorite AI tools and services are tricking you they act like they have some complex AI system and algorithm that has taken months to build but in reality the core functionality of most of these tools could be built in a couple of days or even a couple of hours okay so why does this matter to us I'm glad you asked because it's this kind of stuff that we need to avoid in order to succeed in this challenge these tools will ultimately fail and never make any major money because they are so easy to replicate so in order to succeed in this Challenge and it was a valuable and durable business we need to be looking for areas of the market that are protected from competitors one way we can do this is by adding a private data element to our business this can either be our own data or we can use the data of our customers by adding the secret Source into our business we'll be able to stand Head and Shoulders above these copycat businesses so now our problem is where do we get this data from then who typically has a big old stack of data lying around that's right businesses customer data website data sales data you name it businesses have probably got some kind of data for it and we can use that data in our product to make it customized and therefore inherently more valuable and durable in this fast-paced market and there you have it we are looking to build a B2B AI SAS company so with that out of the way I have a ton of research to be doing I'm going to get back to you when I have our million dollar idea so I scoured the internet high and low for my golden ticket I started by trolling through all the old releases of my AI email newsletters for companies that had recently gotten funding and other interesting use cases for AI and I started to map it all out I spent days putting together the ultimate B2B AI SAS mind map but eventually I came to an important realization this isn't going to work in my research of all the most successful startups I noticed the pattern a phenomenon that happens time and time again in Tech History the archetype of the two founders a partnership of two halves yin and yang the Builder and the artist Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs Bill Gates and Paul Allen Peter Thiel and Elon Musk I can build but I'm missing my other half now of course I have my own development company to build this SAS with and I'm willing to put up up to a hundred thousand dollars of my own money that's right I'm willing to invest up to one hundred thousand dollars of my own money into building this project but I'm not using the biggest asset that I could ever ask for in a challenge like this and that is you the person watching this video the thousands of people with a bright idea and a desire to do something with them real entrepreneurs with real businesses customers and data who are itching to get started on a new AI Venture it's you guys who are the key to the success of this challenge so I'm putting out the call the bat signal in the night sky to all aspiring or established entrepreneurs with a bright idea I ask you to step forward and accept the challenge join me as a co-founder in building this million dollar AI startup now if you need some convince them I will be bringing to the table a few things firstly my Technical know-how and understanding of AI my development muscle my connections within the AI space up to one hundred thousand dollars in capital and finally promotion for our startup through my channel I have the know-how and the resources to bring your idea to life if you have been sitting on the side of this AI explosion just etching to get in then this is your chance so how can you get involved today I am launching my community Discord for everything AI entrepreneurship inside this Discord will be the heartbeat of this challenge weekly calls exchanging of skills sharing of knowledge everything is going to be happening inside this Discord it will be a Melting Pot of entrepreneurs marketers designers developers you name it all in there with the single goal of

              "text": "imagine building a business on an emerging platform like the internet in the early 2000s or building some of the first iPhone apps well with the release of chat GPT plugins recently you have the opportunity to do just that in this video I'm going to be explaining to you what chat GPT plugins are and why this is a once in a decade opportunity to build businesses and create value with this chat GPT ecosystem at the end of the video I'll even be giving you some examples of chat TPT plugins in different industries that you can start building and get ahead of the competition and build your market share now imagine a world where AI can help you with anything from planning trips to ordering groceries or even filing your taxes well that world is now here the recent release of chat CPT plugins is set to change the future of human and AI interactions as we know it in simple terms chat GPT plugins are like building blocks that allow you to extend the functionality of chat gbt allowing it to connect to external tools or applications or data sources openai has already released a few of its own which allow it to search the web and take uploaded files but they are also allowing third-party applications to be built for chat gbt and some of these have already come from companies like Expedia Shopify and Wolfram these applications are already allowing people to book restaurants search for flights and access the vast information that's available on the internet so why is this such a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs what we have on our hands right now is potentially a once in a decade opportunity looking back at the internet boom we saw the early 2000s create this new opportunity and billionaires were made from building new things on top of the internet building websites Etc in the 2010s we had the release of the iPhone and all the other smartphones that came out which offered a new platform for people to build applications on top of and we have billionaires out of that as well and now we have the release of chat GPT plugins which is essentially an app store but for chat GPT with it's 100 million plus monthly active users this tweet by Makai Wrigley I think puts it very very well he says open AI just laid out the foundation of a new era of computing open AI is Apple gpt4 is the iPhone 10gbt is IOS and plugins at the App Store and while this might be a bit of an extreme comparison I do think it is a very interesting way of framing up what we are seeing before us now throughout my time in AI I've always been looking for where is this next opportunity where does the platform come out is it going to be a case where all of the big companies Google Microsoft Etc are able to soak up all the value and take away chances for small entrepreneurs but no this is what we've been waiting for this plugins in this sort of App Store ecosystem that openai has now given us access to is the opportunity entrepreneurs have been waiting for in AI I think this follow-up tweet is also important to mention where he says by the way not saying they're replacing Apple I'm just saying it's comparable to what Apple did with mobile which was the last shift in Computing which I agree with totally now that we've rounded up as a potentially once in a decade opportunity for you to build wealth as an entrepreneur how are you able to actually build these plugins open AI is allowing third parties to build applications and build plugins for chat CPT so you can get access to the plugins API which is on a waitlist currently but very very soon I'm sure we're all going to have access to being able to build on top of that now if you're interested on how to build these plugins and how to make money with them I'll be posting a ton of videos that are in the pipeline already so if you don't want to miss that be sure to subscribe to the channel and hit the Bell so you don't miss the next one the process for actually building one of these chat GPT plugins is really quite simple and almost revolutionarily simple all you need to do is create the application and know the functionality of it as you normally would with an app and then you need to create an API for that so chat TPT can interact with it then you write what's called a manifest file which is basically the instructions that you provide to chat CPT so it knows how to use your app and then you're able to take all of that and integrate it with chat GPT the magic with these manifest files is that open AI is actually using their large language models like chat TPT to look at these manifest files and essentially learn how to use your application using the underlying reasoning and understanding of text and of code it's just incredible that they've been able to apply this large language model technology to essentially understand and be able to use your app with the technology they're essentially using an AI to understand how to operate your Bot Daniel gross on Twitter shows an example of how he's done this exact thing saying that you're able to put up basically upload your entire project into a into the larger token window and then ask for a manifest file to be written on it and gpt4 is so good that it's able to read your entire project and then spread out on a manifest file that you can pass on to chat TBT and get integrated as a plugin on the App Store with tools like the incredible GitHub copilot X which has been released recently which now has a chat window that can basically allow you to write your entire software application for you it has never been easier for the average person to build some of these applications and start collecting some of the value that's available in this ecosystem AI tools can basically build your entire business from scratch now and get you to integrate it into the chat GPT App Store super simply now I know you must be thinking what kind of plugins can I actually build I believe we're going to see is that every industry is going to soon have its own set of plugins that people use and businesses and customers are continually going back to to get what they need to do done for example in the finance and banking Niche you could have plugins that allow for transfer assistance credit card applications loan assistance and management and also financial planning Services another example could be the huge real estate industry that needs property searching and property valuation plugins also mortgage assistance and even home staging tips what we're going to see is an industry that has a set group of plugins that they all flock to and you have a chance right now to build these plugins and get in there first and carve out your market share with this plugins released it seems obvious that we are moving towards a future where people are only really using chat GPT and all of these plugins are going to be allowing them to access the services they need without going to all sorts of different websites it is up to you now to move quickly and start building plugins to fill this need so what do you think is this the opportunity of a decade for entrepreneurs to build value and wealth in the AI Revolution is the release of these plugins comparable to the internet Revolution and the smartphone Revolution is this now the new platform for us to build on top of I'm not going to sit on my hands and wait around and see I'm going to be starting right now and building some of the plugins and showing you guys how to do it on this channel so I've already got a video in the works with 10 different plugin ideas that you can start building right now that is on the way so if you don't want to miss that or any more of my plugins content which is coming up very soon be sure to subscribe to the channel hit the Bell so you don't miss the next one and leave this video a like if you enjoy content like this it lets me know that this is what you guys want to see if you can't tell I'm absolutely buzzing over this release I'm so excited to get started and show you guys how I'm building some of these apps now I can confirm that there is a ton of entrepreneurs already moving on this I have people coming to my development company and asking us to build chat GPD plugins for them already just a few days after this release if you have a bright idea about a chat GPD plugin that you would like to get built or you just want to talk to someone about it and understand if it's possible you can get in touch with me as a consultant down below there's a link to my calendar so you can book a call or if you'd like the entire thing built out you can get in touch with my software development company link will be in the description also so that we can help you out and get that thing built so that's all for today guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one foreign"

              "text": "gpt4 has finally been released after years of anticipation and development but how does it stack up against its predecessors and why are there people saying that it hasn't really lived up to the hype and how can you start utilizing it in your daily life that's exactly what we're going to be talking about in this video here are the six key things that you need to know about the gpt4 release firstly availability and API access gpt4 is available to access now through the chat CPT pro version which is 20 per month if you're anything like me and couldn't be bothered paying the subscription then now's your excuse to actually get in there and try it out you get faster access to chat gbt as normal but you also get access to gbt4 within the chat gbt model selector however if you don't want to pay this 20 per month you can be sneaky about like I have and applied for API access I now have access to the API so I can write up a little chatbot script and start using this API for free essentially I've also got a video coming soon for all of the cool things that I've been able to build with this gpd4 API access so if you want to see any of that and don't want to miss it be sure to subscribe and hit the Bell down below secondly enhance performance let's talk about how impressed of gpt4 actually is this model has outperformed its predecessors in a number of ways firstly it is able to Ace the bar exam with a top 10 performance it's been able to pass the acap exams which are good enough to get college credits with and its ability to understand code is evident in its lead code programming question results which are far beyond previous models so it seems that in terms of intelligence this model is more intelligent it understands things better and more like a human than a the previous models like GPT 3.5 thirdly The increased input limit on this model is insane we have seen an explosion in the word limit from gpt3 to gpt4 from 3000 words to 25 000 words if you've ever tried to build applications with gpd3 you'll know that this is one of the major issues we run into constantly and there's all sorts of things his entire ecosystem of things built around this issue in order to get around this limit by expanding the token limit this much opens up so many opportunities for people to build applications without all the sort of additional stuff you used to have to use in order to get around that token limit essentially this is going to lower the bar and make it easy easier for people to build applications because you don't have to do all the complex stuff to get around these limits now the current versions of gpt4 that we have access to are limited to 8 000 tokens I believe or at least that's what I've seen when I've been playing around with the API this is because open AI is going to slowly scale up the use of this model there's so much attention on it right now there's actually a limit of 25 messages every three hours on chat GPT Pro currently but I assume they're going to be making this 25 000 word limit standard across the board very soon fourth is its multimodal functionality here is where things get wild gpt4's groundbreaking ability to now accept images as well as text as input a crazy example that was shown within the developer live stream for GPT 4's launch was Greg Brockman the co-founder of openai using a hand-drawn image of a website showing it to gpt4 and it was able to build a functioning version of that website in a few seconds there was another point in the developer live stream where gpt4 was shown a meme of a iPhone with a large old style charger cord put in it and it was able to analyze those images and explain why it was funny I think that these models being able to understand memes now could have some very interesting flow on effects for internet culture but that's yet to be seen now unfortunately despite all the hype this feature is not actually available right now so as you'll see in chat GPT Pro there's no image upload button so I guess they're working on rolling out the implementation of this but it will be coming very soon it's hard to wrap your head around just how groundbreaking this is and the kind of use cases that will flow on from this ability but if you want me to make a video on that be sure to let me know down below I'd love to do some brainstorming and come up with a bunch of ways that I could see this being used in effect in different markets like marketing development Etc so let me know down below if you want that video fifth is customizability with great power comes great customizability developers who are building on top of gpt4 through the API now I have access to a system message which allows for much greater customizability of the kind of outputs as mentioned in the developer live stream and on the open AR documentation this system message is not fully set up yet it's not quite working as well as they as they plan to have it in the future over time they're looking to increase how much effect this system message has on the kind of of outputs now the key thing about the system message and the prompt engineering that you have to do to sort of get it right is that it will give a top-down vision of what this particular application or this this chatbot is going to do meaning that there's not going to be as many chances for people to deviate from the purpose so if you're setting it into a certain mode people are going to have a harder time getting in and out of it because of that system message being set so by telling it what you want it to do and what you don't want it to do and that system message is going to be carried through the entire conversation and ensure that you get the kind of outputs and experience customer experience that you really want out of it this is going to really open up the doors to Greater customization and utilization of this AI technology and finally it's reduced bias and better fact checking an essential aspect of any good AI is trustworthiness gpd4 is now 82 percent less likely to give disallowed responses and 40 more likely to give accurate responses these improvements make the AI much more safer reliable and trustworthy for daily use if you've used chat GPT at all you'll be very familiar with the hallucinations that is known for it will just make up some stuff that never existed it and tell it to you like it's a fact now while gpt4 enter gbt pro has been seen as being too stale and boring and very restrictive and its responses compared to the previous 3.5 model that we've been using what I think we're going to see is that gbt4 with its very scientific and uh sort of bland responses is going to be used in a certain use case and in the older models like chpt 3.5 that you're familiar with using that are good at different things they're going to have its own use case as well so I think we'll see a bit of a Divergence and how these things are being applied but it's good as developers and as business people looking to build within the space that we have different different flavors available to us essentially through these models now despite its fantastic capabilities gpt4 does have its share of downsides firstly are the slower processing speeds gpt4 does know how to deliver but it comes at the cost of slower output speeds compared to the lightning quick GPT 3.5 turbo which we've all been using recently this could be caused by a number of factors firstly just the model is more complex and sophisticated so therefore it takes longer secondly the token limit is greatly increased at the moment so from three thousand to twenty five thousand is a huge jump more tokens be more time to process Etc and finally because we are in the early stages of its release uh open area doesn't necessarily have the compute power and the ability to push us out on a large scale we might see a jump from gpt4 to gpt4 Turbo like we saw with gpt3 so I think in time we'll see this end up being a much faster model secondly as it's greatly increased price point for people using the API building applications with gpt4 is a lot more expensive than using the previous models open AI bills people for the API access just to put it in perspective 100 000 requests with the GPT 3.5 turbo model would have cost you 400 and the exact same hundred thousand requests with gpt4 will cost you seven thousand five hundred dollars this balloons to fifteen thousand dollars for that same hundred thousand if you're using a 32k context window version of gpt4 now as I mentioned before I think this will come down to that sort of two different use cases things like GPT 3.5 turbo which are so cheap and so fast will have their own use cases by people who are relying on the accuracy and knowledge and increased ability to understand things and give accurate responses of gpt4 will be willing to pay that extra price to build applications like medicinal medicinal industry or a legal industry where you need that accuracy and of course over time you would expect the cost of these models to come down and thirdly limited internet access and training data unfortunately open AI has not built gpd4 to have the ability to search the internet to get recent information as we probably all hope if you're talking to it through chat CPT Pro you'll see that it has basically the same knowledge cut off as the previous model so it doesn't have all the more recent information from sort of 2022 and 2023 so far which is a pretty significant limitation I'd say now if we're looking at something like Bing chat which I believe has been confirmed recently that it is actually and has been using GPT for the whole time being able to query something and get the latest information that has actually come from sources on the web is a huge huge factor and I think might be a little deal that Microsoft has with openai look please don't add this feature into your publicly available API access we want to keep it sort of locked away in this being a Bing chat version that we have will we get access to the search functionality eventually I think so but as of the current version we don't so does gpt4 really live up to the hype I would say what we've seen here is more of an incremental step from GPT 3.5 to gpt4 not on the level that we saw from gpt2 to gpt3 in my interview with Paul Jacobian the founder of copy AI which I'll link up here great interview if you haven't seen it when Paul was playing around with gpt2 he said that one in 10 answers would be good and he said the jump from gpt2 to gpt3 was from 1 in 10 answers being good to 9 and 10 ounces being good so that is a a huge jump we saw from gpt2 to gpt3 have we seen that kind of massive jump from GPT theater gpt4 I don't think so I think what we have is a more polished version of GPT 3.5 fixing these sort of factual issues in the hallucinations and then also fixing a lot of the issues where you were able to get like the do anything now problems and sort of jailbreak it and get around it I think it's a more a sterilized version but definitely better for certain purposes now as always on this channel we like to bring things back to entrepreneurship and how you can build businesses with this I think the multimodal ability is going to open up so many doors for entrepreneurs looking to make money and build businesses in AI we are already seeing huge businesses like Duolingo stripe and Khan Academy integrate gpt4 technology into their products and I think this is a trend we're going to see uh continue to increase over time I'm currently working on a ton of interesting projects using gpt4 that I can't wait to show you guys so if you don't want to miss out on that please hit down below and subscribe to

              "text": "this video is the ultimate beginner's guide to using the brand new chat GPT API in order to build applications and build powerful businesses I'm going to be going through why this API is so important and such a game changer for anyone looking to build applications and build businesses within AI quickly going over the new documentation so you're 100 up to speed on how to implement this before finally showing you some examples of this API in action we're going to be building some applications on screen that you can copy and paste and steal for your own uses understanding this API in the doors that it opens up is crucial for all entrepreneurs looking to get into the AI space and build value this is without a doubt the biggest opportunity within AI right now and there are going to be billion dollar companies built in this rush so do not miss the life-changing opportunity that comes with this API release please watch this entire video you're going to learn everything and then afterwards you're going to be able to build your own businesses and change your life those who make it to the end of the video are going to be armed with information and skills that they need to not only build their own applications using this API but more importantly see the opportunities it presents as we know within this game it's not always the person who has the technical know-how to build it but the person who can see it and execute on it first so what is the chat GPT API and why is it so significant to us access to this API is a game changer for entrepreneurs and developers alike because up until now we have only had access to the raw llms that underpinch at gbt and not the Fantastic conversational ability that it has what this API allows us to do is to leverage the insane amount of work that openai has done and reinforcement learning and fine-tuning in order to take these large language models like DaVinci 003 and create chat GPT we now have our own Plug and Play chatbot interface that we can put into any application we want and finally the cherry on the top that makes this API release a complete game changer for us all is that it is 10 times cheaper than the previous DaVinci 003 models yes that's right 10 times cheaper and it's faster now us as a consumer and Builder on top of these platforms is the major winner in this AI race we're seeing right in front of us because this is a Savvy move by open AI to undercut the competitors in a major way so that they simply have no chance of competing and they're going to get all of the markets here as quickly as possible so thank you to open AI for being Savvy with the business move and giving us such cheap access to these apis to build applications on top of next we're going to be taking a quick dive into the documentation so that you can understand how they want us to use this and the kind of code that's required to implement it in your own applications so as you can see they say it's powered by GPT 3.5 turbo which is their most advanced language model they suggest that with this API you can do things like write python code draft an email or other piece of writing create conversational agents shoot it in a range of subjects simulate characters for a video game and much more as you can see this is just opening up so many doors that were not open before due to the limitations of the older apis here on screen we have the main point of difference in terms of using this API compared to the previous ones the main difference here is that we have this messages parameter which takes in a list of dictionaries which have the role and also the content so here you can see it has the role of system the role of user and assistant and then the content of the message because they're a simple solution to having some form of chat history and context to the conversation each time your user enters some information it's going to take that and add it to this list of messages say user and in their content and then when chat gbt API replies it's going to go assistant and then put the content that they have just written in there as well and then a little bit more information about how you can manage your tokens which we won't be going into within the scope of this video and one one thing to note down the bottom here is that fine tuning is not yet available for GPT 3.5 turbo but it likely will be very soon now we can jump into jupyter notebook and give you a few examples of how this API works and how you can implement it into different use cases now if you don't use jupyter notebook you can head to Google colab is a great alternative or whatever environment that you like to use you can use vs code Sublime Text whatever it may be you'll be able to achieve the same results firstly you want to pip install openai as you can see I already have it installed and then you need to import open Ai and set up your API Key by calling openai dot API key and then pasting in your API key now we have two different methods we can use to interact with this API the first one I'm going to use here is using the python library and we're going to create a quick chat bot using the API here now I want to make a quick thank you to one little Coda who actually wrote this particular while loop that allows us to create a chatbot so I want to give credit where credit's due he put this up on his GitHub to you so I'll put it in here for us to use as well now to start off we need to create our messages variable and include any kind of setup we want to do here so this is where you do all your role prompting all of your setup in order to get the right output out of the bot so now the first one needs to be a system role so we have roll system content UI kind helpful assistant pretty standard chat GPT like primer then we can take our messages and any kind of setup we've done and insert it into this while loop here which is going to be taking you to input appending the new messages and the API completions enter this message so it's keeping a running total of all the chat and all the context and then it's going to print out the response so this is all going to be available after the video for you to copy and paste over to your own Solutions what you can do with this block here is essentially just change the messages change this top part here insert any kind of setup you want for your Bop say you are a XYZ you do this as this and then you just insert it into this wild block and then you can start running your chat file and so what this is doing is calling the open AI chat completion that we saw in the documentation over here openai.chatcompletion.create and we've picked the model as GPT 3.5 Turbo now we're putting these messages right in here and here we have it working I've said hello and it's replied to us hello how may I ask a student do now here we can demonstrate the context and chat memory that this little while loop has and that the API allows us to work with as you can see here I've got I need help finding the right screwdriver sure I can help you with that what kind of screw do you have I can say it looks like a star and on its own me just saying it would never be able to work with any of the previous apis because it doesn't have any context me saying it they don't know what it is but because we've been talking about a screwdriver I can say it looks like a star and as you can see it's able to give us a response understanding what it is and next we have another method of calling this API which is using an API endpoint and the requests library and python again this is from one little coder thank you so much to him for whipping this up but this allows us to control a lot more of the variables we have the temperature the top P the frequency penalty Etc but it essentially works in the same way what we have is the completions URL that we want to be communicating with we have the payload then we have the headers as usual requests package implementation so here we have the messages in the same way you could swap out the messages into something like this create your messages list and then just insert messages into here if it's cleaner and so we can turn this temperature down to 0.1 now when you're using the API endpoint like this you actually need to include a row within the messages this is essentially The Prompt that you use to send off to the older apis but now you need to include it as role user and then the content is the question you want to ask so here I have a system message that says you are a kind helpful assistant who is five years old and now I entered the question that I want to ask the API which is what is the Empire State Building and now here when I run this cell you can see it thanks for a little bit and then it gets back to me with this big mess of Json here that you see now all we need to do is pluck out our answer here which is in the message content area but as you can see it's given us the answer which is the empire state is a very tall skyscraper Etc so this format allows you to use it as you'd previously done with the API endpoints which is including your message and it gives you back an answer now of course this is done by including the user message as a open-ended question that you post to it now this can actually be Illustrated a little bit better over in post band so I'll head over here and show you exactly how this works so here on screen we have a system message saying you are a helpful science teacher a user message asking the API what is the first computer in the world and we're able to send that wait for the response to come back and here we have all the information that you just saw over and Jupiter notebook but in a little bit of a nicer format so we have the content here the role so just saying this is chat gbt replying to the question now what we're doing in that wild true block that I showed you before is essentially taking this and adding this response into this messages body before we send it each time imagine that I put a comma here and then I pasted this whole row again and I changed this to assistant and then I copied the content of this and then I replaced it with this so now the response has been added to the messages that we send off to the next response so now I can ask a new question by copying this row again and then I can say how big was it now I can ask the API given this context what could it do and here in the content it's explaining what this particular computer could do now the same process repeats over and over and over again you take the content and the role and you assign it to another row within this messages list so what we were doing over in Postman is exactly what this while true Loop here does is it's taking the user input and it's taking the response and it's adding them into the messages list that you have and just growing that over time and every time you make a new request to the API it is going to take that list and remember everything that you put inside it so now that you're up to speed on what this API is what it does and how you can implement it now we're going to go through a couple examples just to show you the kind of options that you have with this API first example I'll give is a coding coach now this API opens up so many doors for specialized coaches because all it takes is a little bit of prompt engineering you can set it into a mode and you can create an entirely new service just with the correct prompt it's important to realize that anything that you were able to do within your chat GPT on your laptop on the website all of those things saved down the side your previous searches and your previous interactions with the bot that had saved as separate instances everything that you've been able to achieve in those all the modes you've been able to set all of the different outcomes you've been able to get out of chat gbt can now be replicated with duplicating those prompts into the messages and now you can programmatically access that for any application you want to build now everything that I had in that column which I'm not able to show me at the moment I could have created an application out of so what we have is this coding coach setup I have said a system message you are a programming tutor was helping the user learn the basics of python you need to ask the user questions to help them understand the language and give them challenges they must complete they can paste in their code for you to check you need to progress them into more and more difficult Theory and practical examples over time so I'm setting things up here telling it what its objective is it's supposed to teach them the basics of python ask questions get responses grade their work and slowly progress these people down towards more and more advanced at understanding python now one thing I will mention that is important to know is that in this current version of GPT 3.5 open AI has said that it does not always pay strong attention to system messages future models will be trained to pay strong attention to system messages but right now they don't necessarily understand or look at them enough so what I'm going to do is duplicate that system prompt as a user message as well just to be 100 sure it understands the setup and putting into it and then we can start the bot properly now for simplicity's sake I've taken that while true chat box block from one little coder and I put it into a chat function so all you need to do is pass it the messages you've created instead of having to repeat the code every time so just to clarify what you're going to see down here so as you can see I have the messages and then I have this chat function and all I need to do is pass in the messages so I've duplicated the system message into a user message so the same thing essentially but this is the user saying it this time so it really understands what I'm talking about then I've got the assistant to say yes I understand and so when I run it this is the output I've said hi I'm here to Learn Python my name is Liam this is what am I trying to accomplish I said start from the basics I know nothing sure thing let's start with the very Basics ask me a few questions and then it actually goes on with now now that you have an idea of what python is the first thing you need to do is install it on your computer have you done that yet or do you need help with that and now it's given me instructions on how to install python on my computer now as I go along it's going to start asking me questions about can you write this can you do this and I'll give it my answers back just imagine if you package this up into a nice looking UI and you put a website up and said Learn Python with a customized python tutor you could get this thing to start setting homework and teaching along and being someone's personal python coach over time this is just a simple example of the power of this API given the right prompt and you're able to plug this into a nice front end for people to have a look at and work with really awesome stuff another quick example here is a personalized email responder in these messages here I've given it four different examples of my own previous emails so that I can learn my style and how I respond so now that I've set it all up all I need to do is say can you reply to this email in my style saying thank you but I'm all booked out for this week and when I hit enter it's going to paste in the email from the person what I can do then is paste in an email that I receive or my assistant could do it paste it in there and get the response as you can see here it's replied to it thank you for reaching out and giving me a personalized one that seems to have matched my style of writing exactly now if you imagine this as an actual application you could say people sign up on a nice looking UI they connect their Gmail account you take all of the information from the sent mail and you take that and you learn from it you put it into the messages in some way and then what you're able to do is get them to Simply input their email that they receive and you instantly give them a response back in their style there's all sorts of different things you could do with this and you can imagine how this platform would look but again just a quick little idea that you could create an application out of and start potentially selling to people now my last example here is really leveraging the new ability from this API which is code writing what this prompt creates is a game developer tool it uses the power of chat gbt to take text and generate code by taking user input and then creating games out of it so I've written The Prompt here you are a game developer you generate Python scripts for games based on what people describe you and I've got a few more things in here hi I need you to help me create a game in Python I will describe the game to you and it you will give me back the script for it please be sure to always include code for a graphical user interface or GUI that appears for me to play the game on is that okay just asking for some confirmation from the assistant and then it replies yes of course please provide me with some details on this game and that is where the user input starts now all I need to do is put in the kind of game at once so I can write tick tack toe now this is going to go off and write me a python script to create that game now after a while it's given us back an entire python script that if I copy and paste it over we can see if this actually works now here is the entire tic-tac-toe game that it's just created for us and I can scroll down and run this now we have our GUI on screen here and I can start playing [Music] now it's obviously working correctly I can click on different parts of this interface and it's going to put down the right character this is just a very basic example of course but as you can see it's been able to create an entire game in just a few seconds of generation you can see where this will go potentially you can get it to do code completion of all sorts of different things but by having access to this code completion feature you are now able to essentially scrap together a whole bunch of different prompts in the most extreme case you could say build me this entire application and then what you could do is chain together all these different prompts and say now I need a backend that works with this now can you write me a basic front-end that connects to this and now we have the ability to connect up an entire web application potentially using this code completion feature that about wraps up for the tutorial guys thank you so much for watching I hope you now are confident in your understanding of the chat GPT API I'm going to be dropping all of this code in the description below so you can pull this up start playing around with it check it out use this code block that one little go to created and start to play around with writing different prompts and pre-loading different messages so that you can turn this into different sort of applications there are so many doors open by this opportunity that you have to start moving on it now or people are going to beat you to it the gold rush for companies built on the back of the chat GPT API is happening right now and before you know it it's going to be completely saturated and filled out now if you have an idea and you want to bring it to reality and you think you really have something special then please you can get in touch with me as a consultant I will help you talk through your idea and figure out what's good about it what the feasibility is but I can also help you a step further with my own development team so if you're looking to actually get it built out into a platform so that you can start

              "text": "I just built this AI chatbot that has a custom knowledge base in just a few minutes in this video I'm going to show you how to do it and give you the exact code so you can steal it and use it in your own projects the problem of adding a custom knowledge based factor to your llm applications is want to pop the bait right now I'm going to be walking you through step by step how I've been able to do this and how you can do it too and at the end I'm going to be giving you all of my code so that you can copy and paste it and apply it to your own businesses or even create your own business off the back of these as well now what's the point of creating a custom knowledge chatbot anyway these large language models like gpt3 are limited in their knowledge up until about 2021 now a lot of the simple applications for llms are being snapped up which use just a gpt3 API to do a simple function the ability to put additional information into a llm and query it about that information opens up enormous possibilities for creating new businesses and I'm going to show you exactly how I've been using this to do the same now an existing example of this that I want to show you is called chatpdf.com now this website takes a PDF scrapes with the information off it indexes all that information and then allows you to chat to a chatbot about the content in that PDF what I'm going to be showing you goes beyond just PDFs but I want to show you quickly on screen here the kind of result that we're looking to get and the ability to take an external information and then talk about that information which is what we're after in this video so I've been able to search on this site for a PDF this time I've gone with something that wouldn't have been included in the original gpt3 training so I've gone with Formula One 2022 regulations so we can now talk to this and it shouldn't know anything about it unless it's come from the PDF we've chosen what are the regulations regarding the usage of power units and Formula One cars in 2022. now as you can see on screen here we've been able to talk to the chatbot about the specific content of this document according to page 82 what else does it say on page 82 please summarize it and it's able to tell me page 82 XYZ so this is the kind of functionality and chatbot that we're going to achieve in this video but I'm going to give you a ton of different ways to onboard different forms of data you're not just going to be able to onboard PDFs but trans scripts Discord messages Google Calendar all sorts of information that you can onboard into these models so that you can use it in a chatbot style interface now enough talking about it let's get onto the keys and I'll show you exactly how you can do this with some simple python code so what we're going to be using in this video is called lamma index I'm going to be leaving links to the documentation in the description but for now I'm just going to run you through the basic usage pattern so you can understand what it's doing and then we can start getting into some interesting use cases for it so to start with we just need to import OS and then set our openai key first thing you need to do is to take all of your data using one of their data loaders and load it into a documents variable for later use now to show you this in action in a very simple way I've taken a article by meta AI discussing the release of llama their live sandwich model which I've just put into a raw text file and saved to a data folder which I'm going to be calling in a second the reason I went for an article on llama is to show you that it really is taking information that it did not know and being able to tell you about it this is because lawnmower was released very recently and therefore there's no way that gpt3 is able to to understand what llama is so to do this I need to import from llama index there's simple directory reader and they don't need to call it with this function here and reference where I'm pulling it from which is just this data folder here then I'm going to load this data into my documents variable I need to use those documents to create an index it's very simple to do you just need to use from Lama index import GPT sample Vector index and then call this function here what this is going to do is take your documents and create an index out of it that you can then query for answers so I run this it creates the index and then I'm able to do this very simple command of index.query and then enter the question I want to ask it and then it's going to print out the response what do you think of Facebook's llama is my question and then the answer is I think Facebook's llama is a great step forward and democratizing so it knows what we're talking about so now that you understand the basic usage pattern of llama index which is to load some data and create the index and then query that index we can now go into some more advanced topics of how we can adjust the models that we use in order to get different results and more specific results so we can jump onto this now now the index we use in the first example is a GPT simple index and so now I'm going to be showing you how you can adjust the model that you use and adjust the settings within that model so that you can get different kinds of outputs so this can be easily done by importing an llm projector and we can set up that llm predictor with our llm and determine the temperature which I'm sure you're familiar with if you've watched my recent videos and we can change the model name so this essentially gives us more flexibility in terms of what we want to be using as part of this indexing engine and the kind of results we want to get by specifying the temperature the model the frequency penalty Etc as you're used to working with other models once we've set up the llm predictor all we need to do is create a prompt Helper and give it a few parameters such as the max input size this basically ensures that you're not going to run into any issues when you're praying it because of this custom llm that you're using so once we have the prompt helper you can just copy and paste all the stuff I know it looks a little bit complex but I promise you it's pretty basic stuff just copy and paste it over and that prompt Hub will be set up already for you now you need to set up the same class of a GPT sample Vector index but this time I'm going to include the llm predictor which is going to take in the information we gave it here which is the adjusted temperature and a changed model from the original that gives us the custom llm index variable here which we can then query with our own questions so using that same pattern we can now go index.query and then ask it our question as you can see we got a completely different answer from this text DaVinci 002 model to the original which I believe would be text DaVinci 003 so by changing these models around you can get it to do different things for you now we can get on to the good stuff which is showing you how you can use different llama index loaders to load different information into these and get really cool results out of it now in order to give you an example of the huge range of data types that llama index allows you to get on board I'm going to head over to the documentation here and then we can head to what they call Llama Hub now once you're on llama Hub you can see all these different data loading methods this is the real magic of llama index and I'm going to be making a ton of videos on all these different data connected types so that you guys can see these in action so for example here we can click on Google Calendar and this is going to read your Google calendar passes the relevant information to documents then allows you to query the index and ask about what's coming up on your calendar now if that doesn't set off light bulbs in your head I don't know what will and the list goes on Google Docs loader you can easily load Google Docs information into your models you have notion loaders you have slack loaders Twitter loaders WhatsApp loaders all sorts of things but what we're looking at here is the Wikipedia loader here you can see all we need to do is import the download loader and call the Wikipedia reader and then we can give it any kind of Wikipedia page name and it's going to take all that information and make it available through our index so here's an example I've got in here and again I'm trying to use some very recent data to prove that this is not just the gpt3's underlying knowledge base but we're actually giving it a custom knowledge base so here we can see something called Cyclone 3D which has happened recently 2023 tropical Cyclone Freddy longest live tropical Cyclone on record so this is obviously very recent information and now we can take this over and try to get an indexed so we can ask it about this particular Cyclone this is very simple to do in typical alarm index fashion all you need to do is instantiate this Wikipedia reader class and then we have ability to load in Pages by simply naming the pages that we want which in this case is Cyclone Freddy run the cell and as before we need to create an index using the documents we've created which are called wikidox here run the cell again now the index is made and then all we need to do is query it as we have before in the same pattern so you load the documents you create the index and you can query the index same thing over and over and over again what countries were affected by Cyclone Freddy Cyclone Freddy affected Madagascar Mozambique and Zimbabwe which is correct now please note that I did have a few issues with the Wikipedia loader here I'm not sure why but it seems to insert and change characters depending on what you put in as a page name so had to play around a bit to get the Cyclone 3D working but this is just one example and I'm sure they'll fix it maybe it'd be better if they got you to put in the link to the page rather than the name but I'm sure it'll be fixed soon enough and now we get on to a bit more of a practical example so this is a customer support bot that you're able to make by putting in your frequently asked questions all sorts of stuff from your existing customer support resources and then create a index you can query and ask questions about your your frequently asked questions so I've gone to Asos I've headed to the customer support section and I've gone into all of of these different questions and answers that I've set up and I've copied all of the information and I've put it into just dot text files so we have a bunch of different information here that we can then query and as before all we need to do is use the simple directory loader and now put in the directory to this Asos folder that I'm referencing here and all I need to do is load the data into that document and as before we just need to run this GPT simple Vector index include our documents and it's going to index all that information in those customer support little text files that I've got and now I can ask it what Premier Service options do I have in Saudi in Saudi Arabia you have the option of signing to the Asos Premiere which gives you free standard and I can change this again in the UAE and it gives me the information regarding the UAE which I have in the documents here and yes it is that easy all you need to do is take your information put it in a folder tell it to load it and then you can start asking questions about it now I want to give you one more example of a data loader that is available through llama index which is a YouTube transcript loader so as we can see if we come over here and we find YouTube transcript this loader features the text transcript of YouTube videos using the YouTube transcript API python package very very simple to implement as you can see here and over here I have the same thing now what I've done is taken a Dave Nick Video is complete YouTube automation tutorial for beginners which I feel like is a fairly good use case say if you wanted to put a massive YouTube video on that's like a two hour course and you wanted to get some feedback and talk to essentially query the information within that course you can put it in here and get a index created on it so very simple to do again you're just instantiating this YouTube transcript reader putting in the URL as it says in documentation for the YouTube transcript loader run the cell and create our documents object create the index and so here I've asked her the question what are some YouTube automation mistakes to avoid which are mentioned in the video there's a section on it and it's able to tell me re-uploading people's content without permission and goes through a list of the things you mentioned in the video now with those examples out of the way I know what you're thinking this doesn't look like a chatbot to me and you'd be right this is not a chatbot this is simply querying an index we're able to send it one question and send us one answer back and there's no conversation history or context going on here I couldn't find anything online on how to convert llama index as querying system into a chatbot so I took it upon myself to figure this out myself and I was able to create this chatbot class here which is working very well and you guys are going to be able to copy and paste this over to your projects in the description I'm going to have all the code so you can get access to it now I don't want to bore you with the technical side of things of this but essentially it creates a messages list very similar to the chat GPT API which I wasn't able to get integrated into this so I had to essentially do it myself now while I assume the Llama index team is still working on getting a chat GPT API integration installed where ever since you'd be able to create our own version of it here by using messages every time you send a message in a response it's added to a messages list and then every time you query it it remembers those messages so that you can have some kind of context running through the chat now all you need to instantiate this chatbot is to put in your API key and give it a index that you want to use in this case we're going to be using the Cyclone 3D Wiki index again and then you're able to start this up and start chatting to it now again to make sure this is not using any other sources of information or existing knowledge I'm going to be using an index that is based on the Llama article that we use in the very first example so I've gone and run this chatbot so now I can ask it what is llama llama is a state-of-the-art foundational large language model who created it so I can say who created it and just say it and it remembers what it said previously and knows that I'm referring to llama and it responds with meta created llama light language model meta AI now while this does not look flashy because we're hearing Jupiter notebook it does show you the ability to load your own custom data set and teach these models something that they don't know gives them a new custom knowledge base and then not only query them in a in a sort of single shot method you can then query them and have a chat interface with them and go back and forth remembers the previous messages all using this code which is going to be available in the description so if you want to take all of this code and copy or paste it over to your own a custom knowledge base then you can do that down below now I really really urge you guys to look at how you can apply this to businesses with the chat GPT API coming out it has opened up so many doors if you're able to load some kind of custom data into these models and create a chatbot like this you can create a business overnight with this kind of Technology now please after this video don't just leave it here go to the Llama Hub and have a look at some of the data loaders that they have available it will really open your eyes and just go through all of them I had such a good time going through and understanding the different ways and different data types and sources that llama Hub allows you to load into their llama index things like slack Discord Google Calendar Reddit CSV files all this sort of stuff can be loaded into these indexes and used for in your own chatbot I'm going to be looking to do some cool YouTube videos for you guys on this how you can create a quick application using some of these loaders and myself my development team have also been working with clients using this exact strategy already to create custom chat bots so if you have a big idea and you want to talk to me about it or you want to speak to me as a consultant or you want my development team to build you out an entire application entire platform then hit down below the link is going to be available if you want to have a chat with me or get something built with me and my team so thank you so much for watching guys that is all for the video but if you want to get this code remember head down to the description you can copy and paste it over to your own projects and get something like the spun up and if you really enjoyed the video please leave me a like it helps my channel so much now if you like this kind of content Please Subscribe as well and hit the Bell so you know when I post my next one but that's all for today thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one thank you"

              "text": "this AI startup just raised 5.3 million US dollars with a simple AI powered business model that you can copy and paste into any industry in this video I'll be breaking down what they're building and how you can take advantage of AI obsessed investors so that you can get in on this trend and build your next AR startup the company I'm referring to is called kaito and they are creating an AI powered search engine for crypto essentially Bing but for everything crypto it combines traditional search style results with AI generated and tailored answers to your specific crypto queries sound ridiculously simple just wait there's more the founder and CEO of kaito Yoo-hoo notice that crypto information was really so fragmented all across the internet and there was no one Central source of information you could go to because so much of crypto information is siled off in different places and typically not picked up by traditional Google search the founders are an opportunity to create a One-Stop shop for all crypto information by drawing on sources like Discord Twitter medium mirror Etc and even podcast transcripts so any information on crypto even from governance forms is being pulled in and stored within kaito So kaito's Meta search enables people to access the entire wealth of crypto information with a simple and easy to use interface the founder said there's constantly people fighting against information overload we are shortening the path to finding out ounces from an hour to 30 minutes to 10 seconds the investor attention on AI is at an all-time high right now with money literally raining down on people who are able to see opportunities and executed on it quickly now looking at kaito and the value and service they are looking to provide and we put our entrepreneurs head on we can start to look at how this business model can be replicated into other Industries where there's large amounts of information that needs to be aggregated and sort of put in one place for people to access it but it needs to be within a specific kind of industry that traditional search does not pick up well the AI industry is ripe for something like this I think because there's so much information spread across medium and Discord Twitter space Etc if you're able to aggregate all of that information and give it to beginners and institutions Advanced people developers that's definitely a service people will be looking to engage with sports is another great example because sports fans typically turn to Twitter and social media for their information they want to get the latest rumors and Analysis on their favorite teams and athletes an AI powered search engine could aggregate all this information from these platforms like Twitter and then giving them one nice and easy to use interface another good example would be a health and wellness search engine that sort of more focuses on the alternative medicine and alternative health tips because that kind of stuff doesn't typically get picked up in traditional search that well so by aggregating all of the alternative wellness and Medicine which is a booming space right now and making it accessible for people as a One-Stop shop I think that could be very valuable as well now these are just a few quick examples that have come up but you can go within your industry or you can go as Niche or as broad as you want but essentially you're just indexing a lot of information and making it readily available to a specific Niche who doesn't necessarily be serviced by traditional search that well if you want an example of this check out find I'm going to put a link to it somewhere here it's an example that I've found and it's a artificial intelligence search engine for developers and so if you want to have a look at what an example of this is up and running unfortunately we don't have access to kaito right now you have to join the waitlist but if you want an example of this kind of technology in action the link will be down there somewhere and you can have a play around with it and see how this developer search engine has been made and the kind of output that the great thing about this business model is that aggregating and indexing information like kaito is doing is sort of the lowest hanging fruit within the AI space right now there's only really three aspects to a business like this the first being setting up your scraping systems to aggregate all the data secondly indexing and storing that information and thirdly retrieving and formatting the information scraping is ancient webtech by now and the storing index in retrieving of information Within These large language models is such a Hot Topic right now there are so many solutions on hand for you to start using if you're looking to get started in the AI space then perhaps this is the kind of business you could be looking at take a look at the industry that you're working in or maybe the ones that are adjacent to it and say Hey would there be any value to people in making sort of a One-Stop shop for all the information like kaito has done one thing to keep in mind though is that you probably want to pick a topic or a niche where you can charge a high enough price for it to be worthwhile crypto is a great example for kaito because there's so much money being made and there can be so much money made from timely and relevant information that you're able to charge your customers quite a lot of money because of the value that they can derive from us so when you're picking your industry or your topic make sure you're doing something that sort of has more value attached to it so you can charge a price that's going to allow you to build a business for example if you made a hiking information search aggregator then probably wouldn't be that valuable so what do you think of kaito and this AI powered search model to take information and make sort of a One-Stop shop for hard to find information within a specific Niche do you think that five million dollars will be well spent and they're going to be able to build a durable and profitable business moving forward or is it just a fad and some investors have got caught up in the hype either way the investor attention on AI is hotter than ever which is great news for entrepreneurs like us so if you've enjoyed the video please leave a like and if you enjoy AI entrepreneurial content that's all I do on this channel so please sit down and subscribe if that's your sort of thing hit the Bell so you don't miss the next one and leave a comment if you have any questions oh we're down there replying to them all that's all for today thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one foreign"

              "text": "what I'm about to explain to you will completely change your understanding of fine tuning and give you a 10 times clearer understanding of what fine tuning is why we do it and how you can use it for your own purposes fine tuning is such a powerful and crucial role in the entire Ai and large language models ecosystem that I want to make sure all of you are 100 clear on what it's for and why we do it hi guys welcome back to the channel on my recent fine tuning video which will be available here I've got a lot of questions from the community and I started to realize that a lot of people don't actually understand what fine-tuning is and why we do it so I thought I'd hop on here today and give you guys a quick explainer and sort of demystifying video talking about what fine-tuning is why are we doing it give some examples of how we can apply it to businesses so that you're 100 crystal clear and you understand this key aspect of life language models and artificial intelligence the first reason that you'll fine tunes May suck is because you're expecting chat qft-like output from your gpt3 fine tune now I must admit that I2 was fooled by this initially and it took me a little while to fully understand that what we are interacting with and the API through the gpt3 API is not the same as while we're interacting with on chat gp2 you've got to understand that chat GPT is an application that has been built by open AI on top of tpd3 gpt3 essentially functions as a huge autocomplete engine and it's able to do a bunch of different tasks because of that what openai have done with chat gbt is they added a ton of reinforcement learning and fine-tuning on top of the gpt3 underline large language model in order to get it to this really conversational and excellent experience that we all are familiar with unfortunately what we have access to through the apis and that we're able to fine-tune is not the same as chat GPT therefore when we make calls to the gpt3 API we're not going to get back nice chatbot style dialogue from it it is just raw autocomplete response from gpt3 why what you may have noticed is that when you're querying your fine-tuned model it may either get cut short by its token limit or Ramble On endlessly and this is because there's so many different variables that you can change and tweak in order to get the large language model which is gpt3 in order to reach the final product or say if you're trying to make a chatbot like chat gbt there's so much work that goes in between what you have access to In The Raw format versus the final output that you're probably looking for so in summary the first reason that you'll fine tune tomato is because you are expecting chat TPT like output out of the raw language model that is gpt3 that we have access to program managers and now the second and what I think is the most likely reason that you'll find to instruct is because you don't properly understand the fine tuning process and why we do it the biggest misconception that I see around fine tuning today is not mean that I myself feel free to as well is that fine tuning is meant to onboard more data into a model essentially to teach a model new things this is incorrect the fine-tuning process is actually intended to help a model recognize new patterns and respond to those patterns appropriately that's right fine tuning is not meant to teach a model new stuff it is absolutely crucial that you understand fine-tuning as pattern recognition training here's a super simple example of fine tuning on a simple task say you have online business and you're hiring at the moment and you're receiving tons and tons of resumes from people all over the world with many different formats but you're getting all of these resumes into your inbox all the time these resumes from different people obviously don't have any strict format so the information of the person can be scattered all over the document in many different places and formats you could take all of these documents and scrape the PDF for all the data that you could find if you scrape all of these PDFs there wouldn't be any uniform structure to the data that you received let's say you wanted to take all of that complicated and messy unstructured data from the PDFs and then reformat it to be really easy and understand so that you can input that data directly into your backend systems what you could do is create a spreadsheet with two columns the first one containing the unstructured data from the PDFs and the second one containing that data but structured how you'd like it to be with each row representing one person you could get a VA to go through all of these and essentially restructure the unstructured data into the format that you would like and repeat this for the entire 100 or 200 rows that you have what you would then have is hundreds of rows of promptly completion pairs you can funnel into the gpt3 model through the fine tuning process that I cover in my fine tuning video which will be linked up here because you now have this fine-tuned model you can call it programmatically and whenever you get new resumes that come in you can take the unstructured data that you scrape from their PDF on their resume put it through your fine-tune model and get it out in a nice structured way that you wanted it in the first place and then put that directly into your systems this can easily be done by integrating it with zapier or something similar another example could be sentiment analysis say for example if you write social media marketing agency and you were looking to track the overall sentiment on one of your Instagram or Facebook ads or on all of the ads that you're running at the moment you could fine-tune gpt3 to become an expert at classifying the sentiment of social media comments to do this you can just grab a few thousand social media comments from Facebook or Instagram and then put them in a spreadsheet the same way that we did with the previous example and have all of the data in one column and then a sentiment label in the other if you get a virtual assistant to go through and label them all as positive or negative or neutral once you have that data labeled you can then funnel it into the gpt3 model to the fine tuning process and you've essentially made gpt3 sort of an expert at tinsman classification for social media comments this is useful because social media comments are a little bit different to the typical kind of text that gpd3 is used to predict a sentiment on so the nuances of what makes a positive or negative or neutral comment on social media may be different to the kind of language that it's used to seeing on blog posts or any other sort of internet archive material that has access to as a social media marketing agency you could then use that fine-tune model programmatically to begin sorting through all of the comments on your social media ads and then determining an overall aggregate a sentiment score for each of your ads to determine how they're performing and what the description is from the people you're displaying these ads from so notice how in both of these models we are not trying to teach the model any new data we are simply getting it to recognize a pattern and respond in a certain way we are making it better at a very specific task so now you may be thinking okay how can I put more data into these models to expand their knowledge for other purposes now this is a very Hot Topic in artificial intelligence and large language models at the moment because there's a token limit on how much information you can put into a API request how can we include other data sources while working within this 4000 token limit that we have on models like gpt3 now one option that you have to expand the knowledge of your model with new data is called semantic search now this is quite a complex topic and I don't think I can cover it fully in the scope of this video but I'll give you a quick rundown so you know what I'm talking about somatic search essentially allows you to take in a corpus of text Data say you have tons and tons of PDFs of box by student author or legal documents you can take that Corpus of text Data put it through a specific function that you can get access to the libraries programmatically but essentially these functions are going to vectorize all of the information chop it up chunk it up and then put it into a multi-dimensional vectoring system so that it sort of tags what the content of these different chunks of data is and then remembers it for later and stores it in a database so all of your text data is taken and chopped up and stored by similarity within your database you're then able to prompt your model when you put your input in it's going to top that up in the same way and vectorize it and see what's similar to it and then bring that data back and then provide you with an appropriate completion using any data that was in the database if it's appropriate so this is a very useful and popular way of adding more data to your models and giving an x a few more things a super simple example of this would be to get around the limitations of gpt3 only being trained up to 2021 data say you want to train it on some new Wikipedia data you could scrape all the Wikipedia data and put it through a semantic search vectorizing function hold it in a data and then whenever you query about their specific Wikipedia article it would go okay I'm looking for something similar within a database and we'll look for it pull it back and give you an answer that a normal gptc model wouldn't because of its data and time limitations on what it was trained on now if you guys like a little bit more information on semantic search and how myself and others are using it in large language model applications and I can do another video on it if you'd like me to let me know in the comments below if you want some more information it is a little bit technical but I'm sure you guys can handle it another option you have to get these models access to more data is by allowing your large language model of choice to interact with a database one of the many functions of large language models like gpt3 is a natural language to SQL query because of this ability to translate natural language into a SQL query we essentially are able to take a natural language and then get access through any information in the database of our choice this is typically done with libraries like land chain which allow you to essentially chain together different operations with different models for different purposes in order to get a specific output so land chain allows you to take in some input take that input into a SQL query perform that SQL query get the data back whenever like that and then translate that again into natural language and then give that to the user so a lot of things hidden behind the scenes but something like land chain allows you to take in the natural language and convert that to essentially database query and get it back to the user I'm actually working on a project right now with a client of mine who came to the channel myself and my development team are working to get a database lookup system that takes a natural language create a database and gets appropriate responses back in natural language so it's definitely possible I'm currently doing it and I'd really really recommend this for numeric data because semantic search can't really handle numeric data does database method can if you have any burning ideas you'd like to have a chat to me about in terms of the session of feasibility or planning the development now or just get my thoughts on the idea in general and you can book a call with me down below it's in the description and in the pin comment my Consulting link so if you'd like to have a chat then you can reach me down there now both of these methods are really really awesome ways for you to extend the knowledge of your large language models and once you combine it with libraries like land chain you can start to make some really really complex applications and it's really important to understand how fine tuning fits into all of this creating fine-tune models that are great for a specific task can be so important in building these larger applications in line chains teacher so if you have a fine tune model that say like we used the example earlier that takes in the resume data that's unsorted and can sort it that is a sort of key step in structuring data that you could then pass on to different parts of the application so keep in mind that fine tuning can be a very very crucial tool when you're looking to build your applications because these models are so powerful if you can make them more powerful at even one specific task they can really bridge between different parts of the application and sort of take data from one form and convert it to another so that you have can sort of connect it all together and make a really really powerful application at the end of the day now regarding land chain I will be making a video on it next week so make sure you're subscribed and you hit the bell for that because it is absolutely crucial that you as an entrepreneur understand land change so that you can begin to sort of frame up what you can do with these language models when you connect them together in a chain once you understand land change as an entrepreneur you're going to be able to see opportunities that you just didn't know existed before I better wrap it up here but that's all for today thank you so much for watching I hope I've been able to clear up some lists and misconceptions that I definitely had at one point and I really hope I've been able to clarify things for you because understanding how fine tunes fit into the whole ecosystem is very very important and not spending too much of your energy expecting to get something out of it that it simply can't do so as always if there's anything you'd like me to make a video on in future please let me know down below if you have any questions about what I've gone over in this video comment down below I'll be replying to all of them and if you're looking forward to seeing the next one please subscribe to the video hit the Bell so you don't miss it and leave a like on this video If you enjoyed it really really helps my channel that's all I asked of you that's all for today thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next one

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be covering the four easiest ways that you can create and deploy your very first AI powered app using gpt3 or other large language models I'm going to be taking four different methods that I've found and have been using recently that allow me to go from idea to prototype to putting it on a site as quickly as possible but also are not very Tech heavy and don't require you to know too much about developing and coding and in general hosting these kind of applications if you're someone with an idea but you just don't know how to bring it to Market or even create a prototype then this is going to be the video for you because I'm going to make this as easy as possible for people who don't necessarily have a technical background so that you can take your idea write your prompt host it and start playing around with it and see it come to life before your very eyes you're going to want to stick around to the end of the video because I'm going to be starting with the creation side of things and ending with the deployment so I'm going to start with showing you how you can create API endpoint and at the end I'm going to show you how you can connect the front end to their endpoint so you can start sharing it with other people tool number one is everyprompter.com every prompt is like the improved version of the open AI playground this is where to start when you're building your first AI application now there's a number of features that the playground simply doesn't have and it's also a much nicer UI and easier to use so here you can see it's a typical playground environment with a model selector here a stop sequence enterer and temperature all your regular settings you can play around with in the playground then you have your prompt entry box here you have just put in a basic prompt of write me five YouTube titles for my video talking about the four best ways to create and deploy your first AI powered app and here it comes back with the response in this black section down here this is better than the playground for a number of reasons but this side panel here is one of them you can see that I can easily switch between different functions that I've created I can open a new one and then it will save them all for me to easily go back and forth between here is the stock Mentor prompt that I wrote from my previous video where I created an entire application using only no code tools so if you haven't checked that out I'll put a link here it's really good video you should definitely check it out you may have seen in that video one of the things about every prompt is that you can insert Dynamic values into your prompts which is essentially earmarking it for later using it in your application now you can see here if I enter this double curly brackets with input in between then on the right we get an input box here now anything I enter in the input box when I submit it it's going to inject it in I miss my family an injector in there and then we get the response we have two ears in one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak so the best thing about every prompt is that now that I've completed my prompt that I'm happy with that I have my little Dynamic path put in I can literally one click deploy this so that I can start interacting with this uh programmatically through a website up here on the right you can see deploy and here it is active deployment I can view the API documentation and what this has done is packaged it all up and I can change the language here to python so that we can have a play around with it now so what this has done is taken this entire font that I wrote and then combined it with their their backend system for handling this and created an API endpoint for me to contact with the post request and then also here you can see the input value is the the key that I put in the dynamic and the double curly braces so all I need to do when I'm interacting with this is change this example value and then send it off to this this API endpoint it also shows us the expected response so here I can very clearly see that I'm going to be wanting to go on to the choices array and then pluck out this text value so this looks a bit Cody I know but I'll show you in a second what it looks like when you're actually running it now I've hopped over to collab just to pop this into a notebook and show you guys how this works so here is the input value I've changed it to my dog died and I miss him a lot so if I submit this it's going to connect to that API endpoint send off the information and get the response back and here you go we have the choices now this looks a bit complicated but what I can do is pluck those out and get the actual text value that we want and just like that we have a custom API endpoint that we can send off our user input and get back a customized response from the API the response to my dog died and I missed him a lot is the key is to keep company only with people who uplift you whose presence calls forth your best from Epictetus now that we have a way to interact with our prompt insert the user input what we need to do is connect this to a front-end so that we can start to interact with it like a normal website or an application so I'm going to be covering all of that at the end of the video so stay tuned so the next way that you can create and deploy your very first AI application is with a tool called promptable.ai now at a first glance this may look very similar to every prompt but this is actually a little bit different and I want to show you why it's similar to every prompt and that I can change between different prompts on the side here but what I want to do here is really show you this evaluate tab so here I have the stock mental quote from my previous video I've played around with it a little bit and I have my input value set here now if we head to the evaluate tab we can do some very very important testing for our prompt it allows me to put in multiple different variables in place of that Dynamic variable of input within the prompt and allows me to essentially run them all at once and then see what the output is on mass I was blown away when I stumbled across this feature because this is such a crucial part of testing your prompts and of your AI applications so when you create some kind of application like the stock Mentor video I did previously and you seem to get the same response back quite a lot from the from the AI this kind of input and output testing is so valuable because I can start to see how often it's repeating the same thing if you're not familiar with this prompt I'll just quickly run you through it I'm telling it that it's a stoic life coach and it's gonna basically I'm a client and it's helping me with my life and it's going to give me a epictetious Marcus release CNN quotes back in response to the thing that I'm struggling with so essentially asking me what am I struggling with and I enter into that input field what I'm struggling with and then what it returns back is that Marcus Aurelius Epictetus or Seneca quote that is appropriate for that situation so I went over to chat gbt and asked it for 10 20 examples of things that people may be putting into this bot so I've got some here I'm feeling anxious and overwhelmed I'm not sure why having trouble dealing with that so I hope bunch of different potential things that people may be asking it so I've just cleared the output so you guys can see very clearly when everything comes in so I'm going to run this with the current prompt which I've included a whole bunch of quotes I'm going to run this prompt and see what it gives us now just at a glance I can already see that I'm getting the same quote repeated a few times so this having this kind of information about what this is spitting back on a large scale allows me to go back to my prompt and keep tweaking and keep tweaking until I'm starting to get kind of responses that I want on Mouse this is why I love promptable because I've been able to come in here and create a really good prompt put in some Dynamic values that I can sort of earmark for using in my application head over to the evaluate Tab and start to see what some if we're getting similarities within the output and what kind of responses I get for a certain kind of input on mass saves me a ton of time and then I can head over to the deploy Tab and it literally deploy my application in a clip all I need to do is hit add deployment we'll call it video once again we have an endpoint that we can interact with a get request so we're going to take this and put it into our front-end application and I'm going to be showing you at the end of the video how you can interact with these uh apis essentially that you're creating the third way that you can create and deploy your very first AI application is with steamship steamship is essentially a managed backend for AI services so that you can come in and spin up a quick application and then they'll create and host it for you so that you can interact it with it programmatically from your front end this is more versatile you get more complex than promptable in every prompt because you can essentially run a prompt based apis but you can also build Lang chain apps which is sort of the the major Focus point for people building on large language models at the moment and I'm going to be making a video on it for you guys very soon so stay tuned for that you can either run these from your machine or from replit I'm going to use replit and what we can do is clone their Ripple they give you an entire template that you can use you simply have to clone it and don't freak out because this looks like a lot of code if you're not very technically inclined this is actually very basic stuff nothing too fancy here and if you really wanted some help with whipping together something like this you can find any python developer on upwork for ten dollars an hour and he'll be able to help you out and get this done I've just quickly spun up a quick example of an application you can make with steamship now this is just a really gimmicky stupid thing to do but I thought I'd just make you guys an example so what this app does is take in your name and your age in response that you get back from is essentially some advice based on your age so what I've asked her in the in the prompt is do you have any advice for insert age you're old like me so it's going to give you back advice based on your age it goes through here nothing too fancy if I run this you can see on the side here generate personalized advice for gpt3 and I need to go into my API key let's run through an example it's taken in John his age is 35 and the advice of the AI is given back is my advice would be to continue learning and growing stay curious and find ways to charge yourself so if I go Liam 22 . my advice for a 22 year old like you is to make the most of your 20s great the amazing thing about steamship is that once you've written your application you've got the functionality working all I've needed to do is run the ship deploy command and then it gives me this right here which allows me to interact with that endpoint that they've created within their website now this is just an example on their website does the same functionality that I just showed you before now that I've deployed this all I need to do to start interacting with this within my application is to head over to read me and then I can go create a new instance I can call it YouTube example 0202 and I can create this new deployment where I can start interacting with it and here I have a bunch of different ways that I can interact with it I can either do it on the web here I can use a python script I can use typescript but most importantly if you're going to be doing what I'm showing you at the end of the video you're probably going to want to use this curl so this is going to give you all the information of where you need to connect to the endpoint uh the headers and also the data that it's expecting as well now I know this is a little bit more Technical and more code involved than the previous two but I want you to know that this is all very basic stuff and if you have an idea you can either come to myself you can get in touch with me I also do Consulting that I've watched recently so it's down there in the description and then the uh in the pin comment as well so if you have an idea and you want to get the spun up into a prototype you can have a chat with me I'll tell you how I do it and I can put you in touch with my developers to get it built out but essentially you can go from idea into a basic python script and then you take all this information here within this curl request then you can connect it to your front end as I'm going to show you at the end of this video now the fourth and final way that you can create and deploy your first AI application is with berry AI now Berry is a little bit too convicts me to cover completely in this video so if you'd like to learn more about how I've been using Berry to spin up quick chatbot examples and how other people have been using to create entire applications and please let me know down below and I'll make an entire video for you breaking it down step by step very AI allows you to one click deploy your large language model apps it's a super fast and easy way to spin up in live website demo that you can essentially create a chat bot interface super easy and leverage all of their hard work they actually have an example here on their GitHub so if we head over to that and it's telling us to ask it if it can accept International payments from India so if I paste this in here it's been able to give me an answer to the question I just asked it the magic behind that little app just there is that all I've had to do is provide Barry with a link to where all that information is stored here you can see on screen is this docqa Pipeline and in order to initialize one of these all you need to do is provide your username your open AI key and then an input URL to the documentation or information that you want to train the model on what berry does is it takes all the data from the web page and then tokenizes that basically learns about it and then can allow you to query it in that chatbot setting this is a super easy way to spin up a quick prototype if you have a bunch of information say you want to make a customer support bot for your eCommerce store you give it a big list of all your customer service queries your your frequently asked questions it's going to learn that instantly and then you can start playing around with it and asking it questions now aside from these very basic chatbot apps where you take a bit of information and teach it to the chatbot so you can interact with it Berry AI is extremely powerful because of its integration with Lang chain and GPT index I don't have time in this video to go over all the details on these but essentially Lang chain is a way for you to chain operations together and this is essentially how people are building the more complex large language models and AI apps at the moment land chain is the name might suggest allows you to connect a bunch of different operations together in a chain so while large language models like gpt3 and others are great on their own for different tasks typically you need to take and user input manipulate it do certain things and you can chain it all together with land chain I'm going to be making a land chain for dummies video very soon because I think it is it's very difficult to get your head around initially but once you understand it it is essentially how all the impressive apps are being built right now and understanding it as an entrepreneur where some are looking to get into artificial intelligence app development is something you really really need to know and now finally we can get on to how we can take what we've just created with promptable every prompt steamship Etc and how can we actually put that onto our website so that we can start interacting it and potentially start monetizing it so to do this in the simplest way possible for you guys to understand we're going to be doing it on bubble.io now I'm logged in here and I'm going to create an app called example site for video I'm just going to skip all that and put in a hitter and a form so here we have our two elements now so on this side I'm going to be using that advice generator based on name and age so if you see on screen here I've got the YouTube example generate and all the information here so this is how I'm going to interact with this API input so what we need to do to interact with the application that I made in steamship is to provide it with a value for age and a value for name name age rename all of these name label it's super important to name your input fields and your button so you know what you're looking at later on then we're going to get some text to display the output leave it like that we can Center it because it's a rich text editor we can Center the text great okay so what we're going to need to do now is head over to the plugins we're going to add a plugin which is the API connector and install that we're going to add another API we'll call this steamship and then we're going to copy this URL here which belongs can expand this now depending on your application your curve request here might be different but you need to find it you need to take note of all the different aspects of it the URL the headers and then you need to start putting this into the bubble back in I'm going to start by taking the URL here and I see it's a post request so I can see a post here and paste in the URL and I can change users to an action instead of data and now anything with a h tag is a header so I'm going to start copying these over add a header key and value foreign key and now we can see this D which is the data you want to copy that without the quotations and now we have the name and the value so double AI connector allows you to put in Dynamic content so here we can let it know we're going to insert something from our website we're planning to put something in there that is not going to be hard coded we can do it within these angle brackets so I'm going to put name here and then age here of course so what we can do now we have everything written up now we can initialize this call by providing it some example data so if I put my name in my agent now in this case steamship is trying to return me some text not Json so I need to make sure I've set my data type as text here then if I scroll down and I submit this re-initialize the call it's going to give me the output from this API call right next to it my advice for a 22 year old like you is to start thinking about your future now so we've verified that everything is working I'm able to connect to my steamship application everything is all ready to go and now I need to connect this API setup that I've done and connect it to my front end within bubble now what we need to do quickly here is just set up a state so Define another condition this text create a new state generated text so this is going to be a toggleable state that once our API call has returned and it's given us text we can then update the state so that it updates on the web page so I've got this text generated text when this text generated text so that's the state is not empty then the element is going to be visible then I'm going to make sure that it's not visible and it's collapsed when hidden foreign if we go on to the button here double click it and go start edit workflow we can select this here which is steamship so when the button is clicked first step is to make that steamship API call and after that what we want to do is element actions set State and then search up submit button which we've named on the editor create a new custom state that is generated text State type text the element is the submit button custom state is generated text now the value all we need to do is leave it as the result of Step One steamship API call we need to click on this text box here and rename it to response text or anything that you like and then we insert the dynamic data by searching up response text generated text and there we go let's Center align this so it looks a bit nicer make it a little bit wider I'm sorry I just had to go back and fix a little area here I had the elements hit to the button you actually need to set it to the response text that we've named so response text generated text and the result is the result of step one which is the API calls so just to break down this workflow we're going to when the submit button is clicked it's going to take in the input and send it off with the API call it's going to update the state to contain the response text and then that's going to apply it to the response text element within the editor so it should all be working now if we go back and we preview this into my name and age and get advice my advice would be to make sure that you're taking care of yourself and your future there you have it guys we've gone through four different ways where you can create and deploy your very first AI application obviously very basic example but you get the idea bubblers are very good method for if you don't have much experience technically to spin up a quick prototype and you can easily Host this on a domain just buy a domain connect and then you have your first application up and ready to go that's all for today guys I hope you got something out of it I've given you four different ways that you can deploy and create your first AI application now I know it was very simple in the beginning and we got a bit complex with bubble but if there's anything that was unclear and you want me to go over it again in another video I can definitely do that for you guys I'm going to be doing my land Chain video but if you want to see more about Berry Ai and how you guys can create a quick chat bot for your business or for a different purpose let me know and I'll make a video for you guys I am here to serve you so please if you've enjoyed the video

goes where are the areas that you were seeing the most action in the most progression at the moment and I sort of the most exciting view hello and welcome everybody back to the channel today we have this very special guest on the channel Adam avelino founder of mexico.io which is a AI website building tool that can take a single prompt and build an entire website over for you so thank you so much for coming on the show today Adam it's great to have you yeah thanks Liam thanks for having me it's great to just chat some tech and um yeah play with AI as well yeah awesome so give us a little bit of background about yourself obviously an Aussie quite close to uh to my background so it's good to have someone someone's me on the show so give us a quick rundown on who Adam is and how you've overflowed to this point in your life of founding mixer last one yeah so I've been in startups for almost 15 years first startup was called design crowd which was Venture backed co-founded that one and probably about eight years maybe a little bit more now but we got to the point where we were had three offices and grew up quite a considerable team and started up a sister company called brand crowd as well which does was a design Marketplace and from that I cut my teeth and was able to kind of grow understand and get a get a sense of the the technical world but also the business with the startup order I guess and yeah I got to the point where this I knew the scaling part wasn't necessarily where it was where I enjoyed things I enjoyed the early stage startup kind of challenge and that's kind of what led me to towards mixo so mixo is a startup launch platform that allows entrepreneurs to go on there and put in like a one sentence description of the idea that they want us to launch and it will create the landing page and give them the ability to start capturing leads and customers to to launch their product or or startup with mixo was a venture that my me and my co-founder Giles Butler started which was the scratch our own Edge it was to validate startup ideas pretty quickly on our own and probably in the last six months we started to adapt AI into that and start to kind of combine the two but yeah my my passion is around playing with Lego when I say Lego I mean like Tech Lego like little bits and throwing them together and seeing what sort of damage we can kind of do and yeah I think we focus on not just what we do but how we do it and that's kind of how we've got to to where we are today really awesome what was the the founding process of mixolite and any tips and tricks that you have from that the things that you wish you knew when you were getting started on yeah for sure so I guess rewinding back and and I guess why and how mix that it came about we start to do work with a lot of VCS as kind of their internal team building our applications and and part of that was helping them also do some validation and do some early stage thinking in terms of speaking to customers but also you know spinning up landing pages and we kind of store the same thing over and over again and even when we started to do our own product ideas we were able to kind of start to validate by speaking to customers but when you've got five to six ideas we want to throw throw it all at the wall and see what sticks and they protest in I guess and and collecting leads before you launch was a pretty success pretty successful at that so we're able to generate interest I guess and collect leads and speak to customers before the actual product was built and we start to scratch our own itch in terms of building out I guess the editor portion of mixo and then the view internally was well we've kind of got that work in it out like a very it was built almost for you know our mums and dads and you know very little Tech ability but wants to kind of get something live really quickly and then the idea was with we to start that with AI and some of the you know accelerate that onboarding process effectively and then give tool in along the way to help them you know validate help them grow it becomes a an actual startup launcher as a platform and so that's kind of where the idea of Mexico came came about and I guess we're out from our perspective we we saw we were kind of in some of the AIS you know playing with AI pretty early on but the main kind of push towards using AI was when we found kind of the intersection between application like we we knew we had an editor that caught who kind of bring like customers like using it but we had a way of accelerating that and then also on the other side having a distribution channel that we can kind of tap into and if I was to kind of give some give my two cents on what has helped us to kind of grow to where we are today those early stage tests of what is our distribution Channel and having the ability to kind of work out well you know we had some success as a referral Channel and some affiliate stuff we've got some success in you know starting to generate SEO here and that type of play finding out where that distribution channel is whether that's what mixer or anything else is probably the one key thing in terms of a takeaway in terms of growing something from zero to something that that I think about and in the early days it was really testing those distribution channels and that's kind of where we use our landing pages it's kind of not just testing an idea because you can speak to people and validate an idea by seeing you know is this a problem that I'm solving for this person and I think that's that is part of the growth part of any startup but from our perspective using landing pages to test a distribution Channel and knowing that if I put a dollar in I'm going to get two dollars out that's kind of the secret source to how you grow something from just you know a couple a couple interested users to you know in over a 50 000 sign ups in in a space of you know 30 days so awesome well I think well for people who haven't seen next I'm going to put some stuff on screen now I'll just give a sort of a playthrough of me having a look at it and creating a quick website with it so for I see I totally understand what you mean with the being able to quickly pop up a landing page and I think it's definitely a really big opportunity hence why you've been able to do so well if it I was just playing that with WordPress and stuff recently and trying to so I'm working on a video currently that's taking essentially a comp-based business putting on a landing page connecting a basic back end to it and then running some traffic to it with a promotion on social media Tech talk or YouTube or something I've had such a difficult job trying to do this in a low effort way so obviously I could get this built out with myself and my team but to be able to do it in a way that I could tell my audience this is a fairly straightforward way if you don't have much of a tech background number one how you get the website design number two how you get the prom three the most tricky part is getting that back in so I wanted to ask about what is your steps with Mexico I know it's considered to be sort of a prototyping and testing platform but I think that it could really be a space to connect just one element and have like a very simple back end on the back of that like for the the video I'm trying to shoot and these have taken some user input I've processed it in the back end with a GPT API and then send it back in a response but just doing that simple simple sort of back-end work has been so difficult and trying to get it done in a way that isn't too code heavy for people so is there any intentions with Mexico to sort of move towards having some other kind of functionality or do you purely want to stick to the niche of quick prototyping no other no other rubbish really no I think we we started off particularly with the editor in in kind of scratching our own age and that's kind of why there's those like that parallel between that that audience and what we've been doing internally but we've kind of seen three types of customers that we we see are core users and one of those you're kind of directly touching on there being you know try to automate and create something really quickly and get it out there and almost automate some of the the different parts to it and I guess before going on to some of the functionality I'll just touch on the other two because it does play in the other two that we're seeing a lot of traction with is users that have bought 30 40 domains back in the past the domains are sitting there doing nothing but having the intention of starting something they just want to spin something up Let the AI create a concept and start seeing if they can get some customers and traction yeah I'm having a leak collection form on there as well exactly exactly and that's that's kind of the second and the third is obviously agency I guess agencies that are out there trying to create a basis with their clients getting things spun up really quickly again but wanting multiple pages and wanting to kind of generate of these sites on the Fly and so that's kind of the three kind of areas we're seeing trap traction and I'd say that in terms of functionality in terms of roadmap we're going to see kind of three areas where we're kind of working on the launch launching an idea in an aftermarket validating and building out the copy and the SEO let's call it and some of the different pages as well and then the growth aspects and within age there are opportunities for AI to obviously play A Part obviously within the growth part we can kind of help out with blogs and social media and that type of thing as well so what we see in terms of roadmap it's kind of Hit the what you're asking before first first and foremost we're we're working on two areas one which is adding more functionality to the editor so more pages the ability to kind of spin up different pages really quickly whether it's a pricing page a you know basic stuff like terms and conditions but also contact us about us you know the typical stuff you you'd want to have connecting up within a website but then you've got those multiple those things that you find within CMS like WordPress which is like blogs blog articles partner ship Pages you'll have all the different areas where you could again product the AI it will generate those pages and content and you can start to spin those up against a template so that's kind of the the first protocol the second protocol is also automation so hidden zapier whenever you've got a user that comes on and uses a sign up form and obviously the forms are going to get a lot more you know Advanced allowing users to capture phone and different things but allowing you to kind of hit up connect up to zapier and hit MailChimp if a user comes in and send send out a campaign that way in an automated fashion the ability to kind of do something on your end and hit a publish back to your back to your site and pick up more site data so in an example where we start to pull in blog articles and content from different Integrations then you can kind of you know work back and tell it you know publish this now back to back to the web live and now the AI is picked up and added something else there and you know that all kind of plays together in that idea of launching something validating or giving them the ability to kind of validate this idea that you've launched but also growing and kind of those are the three areas where balancing and juggling to kind of keep with our core customer I would say but it opens it up to I wouldn't say early I wouldn't say our core customers early stage entrepreneurs I'd say our our core customer is probably entrepreneurs in the general more general definition it's an entrepreneur wants to use something give and provide value to others and so we're given that ability to kind of get that out there and build a web presence really quickly and whether that you've got a community or not you can kind of tap that awesome and so for some of those people who are wondering what's under the hood I've played around with mixo and I'm trying to figure out how you've done it so could you if you're at liberty to discuss it what model are you using underneath from text to a website is quite a big jump so if you could unpack that process and maybe demystify a bit for myself and others who are trying to figure out how these models are taking text and then being able to say imagine it was text you song like that that's quite a bit just so how have you bridge that Gap is it lots of micro sort of prompt change that I've taken from one step to another so you do the images first and then you do the copy after so how do you how do you go from a text to a website yeah so in terms of the process what we did is we sat down and we tried to use different models and different platforms as well we played a little bit with that well there was probably a bunch of platforms we played with but the main one that we probably had the most successful was obviously open at open AI has their models got better and better we were able to do more and kind of the way we prompt and provide context got better as well and I think that's kind of part of how we do a sum of the website structures so how we do it is we look at when you put in a prompt we are actively changing the context for the prompt that we use for open AI so internally we over time as you add more prompts we are using what's worked well based on a few different things you know users that are stavian put in a similar prompt and save it to their account we are using like those reinforcing the the context or the AI and over time that kind of gets better and better one of the things we are working on now is expanding out that model make and we're kind of using a few different platforms as well the use and the selection of images for instance works better in in some platforms more than others I would say that it's probably not nailed as well how we're doing it it's something we're we're doing so many prototypes of different things and we get some weird and wonderful results but I think that is right now that there is no real Secret Sauce in terms of what's the best platform I think for US Open AI works but I've seen for in some other cases you know it's it's probably still needs a little bit more um mathology so and I've seen that the images that you get on the site it's always like very good very native cartoonish pictures how are you are you generating those or do you have a bank that they've been tagged as different different types yeah it's it is used in a library at the moment it's something that we're really going to to move forward with in terms of generating and giving very bespoke a bespoke feel it's one of the going back to some of the features we're talking about one of the things that we want to do is not just kind of structure the same template and you know everyone kind of gets a similar feeling site let's put it that way we want your site to be very bespoke because I I feel like you know I put the the tech hat on me and think where this goes and how you know what's the future look like and what I would love to kind of play with is this idea of you you know it generates you know almost instantly in into the future and you can every hit with every user is is unique so you know you don't you no longer have to store a website and have it sitting somewhere you're getting fresh content increase that you've said that with my business plan provide the same idea it's like why are web page is not unique to visitors I mean the issue was always how are you going to determine who that user is like you need some sort of data points on the previously if they're coming from Facebook if you if you say you just have gender and age and location those three things would be pretty important in determining what the user sees so I'll be curious to hear what you've you've figured out on that side of things um because that's just that whole figuring out where the data comes from is a big big question that we've been trying to figure out as well but yeah okay and just location on that one like I would be like I know you can kind of pick up location and serve them different pages right now but even in previous previous experience with websites and you would know that being on like I go on a website and you know you track bits and pieces and what I do it doesn't it can be catered completely to me if that as long as there is obviously the security and authentication part but even that starts to go away a little bit when you start to think about well crypto wallets and the ability to kind of connect up and you know an identity with with the the provider so yeah yeah yeah when I was looking at those trying to get how we can be getting I mean it's the user if you have an account created I guess that's an easy way to be tracking user information I guess it's easy to get Dynamic websites and unique experiences for people of who have returning visitors and you've collected some sort of information off but it was always a question of how do you get these these guys that are coming in with essentially no idea apart from their location so if you know IP so yeah so I've gone over what's under the hood we've gone over the initial founding stages of mixo and we've gone over where you want to take it now I guess for you as an AI founder now what is the places that you are seeing the most opportunity I'm not sure how deep you are into the actual AI side of things but if you were to say start another business not that not that you've you haven't got your hands full already but where are the areas that you were seeing the most action and the most progression at the moment at a sort of the most exciting View yeah I think well for me the alms the AI landscape is kind of made up of I think the winners within the landscape are kind of in two areas they're the ones that are going to kind of own the models and be kind of the drivers of the core model and data that kind of drives a bunch of AI use from a technical perspective as well and the other side is companies that can kind of bridge the usage of AI so the adopt ones that help with adoption I kind of I kind of see mixo at the moment planing in that space more than the other that that'll kind of grow over time I think in terms of how what we do with each but I've I've kind of seen that adoption part I guess everybody is currently gluing AI to whatever they are doing so you you know you've previously run a marketing SAS it's got AI in it now you know yeah and I think the ones that will succeed are the ones that one I go back to the distribution Channel like they they have that ability to kind of go out there and whether it's ai ai or not there's there's really a designer need and the AI is just putting a rocket underneath what was already there you know it it gives you that ability to kind of speed up and create an instant you know instantaneous value where previously what there wasn't and as I look around the landscape and kind of think what what are people doing well like the ones that are just kind of taking open Ai and just throwing it on the page for the user I think over time you know there'll be a dime a dozen and kind of the user even you know chat GDP and you know the ability to kind of use that directly will kind of weed some of that out but in terms of what we can do with it it's really on that application side and I kind of I do get excited when I see guys out there that are kind of generating trying to generate that personalized websites trying to do stuff that I don't think from a technical perspective anyone's ready for right now but it kind of drives everything else forward and so yeah we I I to be honest I just I love kind of playing with some of the image generators seen some of the the video animation stuff that comes out and you know that entrepreneur's item is like oh wow we should really you know go out there and give this to this group because that that'll solve a problem there but you can't pick one at a time I think with some of this that's that's all part of it yeah I think have you seen that text to video stuff that's come out recently yeah that's that's some wild stuff for me because as soon as you can not only text that much but checks to 60 images per second to create a video then you've got completely changing like if you if you stretch that out far enough it's you can create a a movie and a product essentially like that's and you can use the story writing ability off these models like it's it's so it's so huge where this could go yeah and what's interesting with that is you previously you've had a writer that is hamstrung because they aren't necessarily an animator or an actor or and so they have a process to get out there to kind of you know make their artistic Vision a reality and in the same way with mixo you've got entrepreneurs that have an idea maybe 10 ideas want to get it out there create a website don't know how to kind of get users to speak to how do I get my first customer how do I take payment all that type of stuff and I think this early stage AI adoption is given giving individuals that want to kind of take things in those next few steps but they just don't have that capability you're kind of giving them the the chance to do it and the capability so there's a huge huge amount of power shifting to the individual or the small team right now so Tomatoes talking an interview about how essentially businesses like square that you should take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and huge huge development teams and Engineers now if you take this AI ability to like code out far enough you only need a small team of four or five Engineers together so it's big Tech is essentially under attack it in a major way because the the cost to create these companies essentially with underlying tick they used to be the biggest moat right was Facebook or something like square or Stripes sorry what's the exactly used there's such a massive mode of development around it but that is becoming smaller and smaller and smaller so the whole software industry is essentially under under a bit of stress right now not necessarily right now but in the future for sure so it's definitely the power's moving to the individual for sure that like the individual scriptwriters or entrepreneurs I think the guys are going to have the most ability to because we're already quite adapted to being adaptable you know we're always ready to take on new tools and stuff so being the Jack of all trades and this digital Renaissance that's going to be a very valuable thing to have so it's very exciting for for all entrepreneurs out there I think and if if you can't make it with with these tools that you know at your disposable when other people sort of like if you go back 200 years you have to build a store and stuff now we have access to write an entire movie with a sentence so very very exciting times and it's great to see someone like you who's out here taking taking advantage of it for sure yeah thank you thank you and I'm excited to be honest to see demographics that don't get that opportunity to kind of to be able to kind of do this as well because it lowers that barrier to entry as well because you don't need to be such big resources as well different parts of the world different languages you know AI is language independent you know you can kind of spin up a start in Spanish in two seconds where previously I needed to know Spanish I need to find a Spanish developer and so the more it kind of TAPS that and the more you know it's it's all ages as well so you know I've got two two kids under four I'm sure when they start school they're going to be using AI enabled tools to be building stuff that when I was starting out in a startup or running a CTO or design crowd you know uh they could do what I was doing as a CTO or running things and it's crazy to to think definitely crazy what you talked about before was that you found early on when you were launching mixer you found well you have free appetizers against fighting out could you walk me through you said you you really enjoyed this initial phase of startup which is getting things going getting things off the ground ideation process and I'm I'm the same I'm always much more of a thinker at the start and I'm not so good at the back end of optimizing and building I like that front half but if you had any tips what were the biggest issues you had and sort of how did you find that first Channel network so if you could talk us through what worked from Mexico initially how you identified say your first Avatar and what was the the method of Outreach and distribution channel that you found work best to get in touch with that Avatar and get your first say thousand thousand signups because I think that's what a lot of the audience is most interested in that the initial initial step yeah so with mixo the the thinking behind what distribution Channel we were going to attack we we dabbled in a bunch of different ones uh early on so everything from Paid newsletter promotion to the typical kind of SEO growth and that those type of things but I think the one that we were able to validate pretty quickly was affiliate marketing and kind of partner marketing and I think it's no like the thinking behind it was we are in a space that is quite remarkable we are doing remarkable things and if you kind of take yourself back to when Uber kind of started this idea of I don't have to call a taxi I can just on my phone bring someone here that's cool I'll show someone else this and you know they'll kind of I'll get some value as a you know just by telling telling others and we took that concept and tried to go out to our users that have created things and they obviously love the product and tried to make one invite them to our affiliate Network and that's yeah they started earned cash in fact effectively they get 30 or whatever they put through for the life of their customer and they they love that so they start to make a little bit of cash through the business and they kind of love playing with tech and kind of moving that way but they are also going out there to their own networks even if it's not an affiliate Network to kind of talk about what is happening and for me I think if you're playing in a in a space where there is a bit of that remarkability remarkability meaning I have to remark to someone about this thing because it's going to make me look good you need to kind of double down on that and I think try to put your distribution channels your channels of which you're going to get customers and leads put as much fuel in that fire so there's no it's everything from if look we have a free plan on on mixo you can set up a site and get out get it out there you know it has a badge on it it's the whole kind of you know made by mixer kind of badge and website um WordPress domain exactly exactly and it it says on it made by AI made made with AI or mix though the idea being we're trying to kind of get as many eyeballs within that space and drive as much traffic that way so that's all those organic and kind of word of mouth type channels um when you've got something remarkable pretty key I think I could go on there's a couple others but they're probably the the the main ones that really sparked early and I think within any startup business as you start to spark and get that ability to kind of grow you know throw in fuel on the fire with you know spending more money on you know you've done we've done enough ad testing in the background to know which ones work which ones don't uh but also we're in the AI age we're generating a lot of content really quickly how we optimize that to to kind of help our rankings within Google as well so they all kind of play together yeah I like what you're saying about this like remarkability concept and I I guess affiliate marketing takes that too like like a whole other level right it's remarkability multiplied by the the size of a person's audience so it's really interesting because it is I've seen a lot of the YouTubers making content on and you're getting great views like 80 000 views on one of the videos like really great reception if you get the right title on they're talking about well I can make it this I made this website in one click or one prompt but it is very remarkable so yeah and for us it's only the beginning as well as we keep playing with tech and doing cool stuff it only again it's that idea of trying to have a multiplier effect it's not just we're not just creating a single page website anymore you can spin up this whole this whole other this whole thing with multiple websites with multiple pages on this website I can do different stuff with it it starts to tap different audiences but also create keeps that remarkability piece ingrained and so if any any young entrepreneurs like myself hoping to get a little bit of advice from a veteran like you what 15 years in an industry what would you say are the top tips for one does the kind of path you should be looking to go and how you should sort of see yourself as an entrepreneur and the skills you should love to learn and sort of just general advice on getting into the startup industry and building businesses and any sort of of the most important lessons you've learned along the way yeah yeah so I'd say my two bits of I guess advice would be one to be value focused as an entrepreneur so finding a a market or a problem that you feel you can add value to rather than just take what's already there and just keep spinning up the same stuff you need to kind of know well I am actually adding value and I think that goes with from a from a team perspective as well the people that you add to your team they each add their own value to the to the wider team and to the End customer in solving the problem the second as you're kind of in this area for a long time you kind of feel the thing that keeps you up at night is the distribution channel the the how am I going to get that ability to kind of pay a dollar and get two dollars out even if I go out and I validate and I've got a problem that I installed in and I am the best in the world at solving this you need to get an audience and you need a good audience quickly and your distribution channel is that ability to kind of get that audience however that is you know I talked about an affiliate Channel where we give away 30 effectively but that is effectively marketing costs that's ability to put a dollar out there but I'm getting two dollars back and I think if you focus in on that as well as validating that this actually is solving for that customer I think you you start to move towards goal much quicker and you can start to set some ambitious targets as well I think where this is heading finding areas of adoption identifying those opportunities of bridging gaps and looking around you to kind of yeah connect the dots and like oh I see this problem and I actually can connect to those customers how do I use AIO how do I use any bit of tech to kind of bridge that awesome well I don't want to take up too much exam that's been an awesome set of advice for all of us as youngsters or even established entrepreneurs looking to move into a role more like you thank you so much for for coming on Adam it's been a real pleasure and I'm sure the audience has got something I'm really great out of that out of that interview so thanks so much for your time and hopefully have you back on the channel at another point and you've got to update from Exo but let the users know that the viewers know where we can find you on Twitter or LinkedIn or wherever so what are your socials yeah so you can hit me up on Twitter Adam arbolino to be honest right now if you jump on the site and you go into chat you'll probably hit me on my co-founder because we are hand-holding every single user through this journey so you could jump in and say hello it's been absolutely awesome Liam really appreciate the chat and yeah sometime yeah for sure now I'll be dropping a link to check out Mexico down in the description of course so you guys can head over there to have a play there's a free plan you can get in there and start putting up some prototypes for websites and ideas that you may have if you watch my videos you've definitely got a few ideas bouncing around so head over there type your font been and get an entire website built out just a few seconds for you so thank you so much Adam now a friend of the channel happy to happy to promote mixer for you because this is such an awesome tool for people to be playing around with at the moment so that's all for today guys thank you so much and I will see you in the next one"

              "text": "I just created this awesome AI tool powered by gbt3 in a few hours using nothing but no code editors like bubble so I'm going to be showing you step by step in this video let's get stuck into it today I thought I'd hop on and show you guys how you can create your first AI tool hosted on a website for you to start selling and making businesses off the catch with this is that I'm only going to be using no code website and Tool Builders like bubble this means throughout this tutorial I'm not going to write a single line of code and I'm going to go from an idea to a final product of having a website hosted that people can go and interact with and use underlying large language models like chat GPT like gpt3 on this website I know that sounds like a lot but I'm going to be compressing this down so that you guys can understand it in the most simple way and I'm going to be giving you step by step guide me on the keys showing you how to do this and we'll start with stage one which is coming up with an idea for my site in this video I really wanted to show you guys how you can use prompt engineering and use these large language models like gpt3 and combine it with a little bit of user input like I've mentioned in my previous videos my uh entrepreneurship guide which I'll put up here I've mentioned one of the business models is a prompt based business today we're going to be building a prompt-based AI tool slash business so what you're going to be doing is taking in a little bit of user input from the user on the website and then combining that with a prompt that I've written and then sending it off to the API getting the response back and giving that response back to the user so that was the kind of restriction I had on what this site and what this tool would do I thought in this for a while and I'm a very big reader and fan of uh startup philosophy if you're familiar with Marcus Aurelius or Seneca or Epictetus these are all stoic philosophers who have a really well well known and published writing that is uh really quotable stoic philosophy is a great operating system I've heard people call it for entrepreneurs so I really enjoy the literature and I thought if I can make a tool that allows people to give what they're struggling with like I'm struggling with a breakup I'm struggling with my business not performing how I want to this tool is going to take that user input and then using the power of the large language model give back a recommended Style a quote to sort of galvanize them and give them strength through the stuff of time in their life and so I have my idea a stoic AI powered life coach now I have my idea now I need to start writing a prompt and using prompt engineering to interact with the large language models to start getting these kind of responses that I want so we're going to hop onto my laptop here and I'll show you how I'm doing it here we have on screen a website called promptable.ai that I'm using to help write my prompts this is essentially the same as the open AI playground but it allows me to save things a lot more easily and I feel like it's just nicer interface for me to use I've been using this recently I'll drop a link to it below if you want to want to sign up and check it out okay so on screen here you have a little mock-up of what I want the main functionality of the site to be so are you going to go onto the site scroll down and see this uh prompt which is what are you struggling with and then they're going to be able to enter what they're struggling with say it's a breakup say it's a difficult situation with their friends or family they're going to be able to enter that into the search box or not search box but text input and then hit the get wisdom button and then below it is going to spit out the large language model generated solar system to help them out so now that you understand what I'm going for we're going to hop back over to promptable so that we can start crafting The Prompt in order to get this working behind the scenes okay so here I've written up a really bad basic prompt but this gets you the gets the idea this is a zero shot prompt if you don't know about prompt engineering and understand what zero shot means and fuse shot which we're going to go into later be sure to head to my prompt engineering video which is going to be up here that's a absolutely vital skill if you're going to be making businesses and tools in the in the AI space so if you don't understand what comp engineering is I definitely go check that video out and then come back and uh follow along with the tutorial so we have a zero shot prompt here give me a quote from one of the great start philosophers Marcus Aurelius Seneca and Epictetus that helps me with struggling with my business so I'm struggling with my business and I want help from one of these stock uh philosophers so if I run that then it gets me back apart which is pretty good it's not the events of life that shape us but our opinions to those events by Epictetus so this one is a very basic prompt of it's giving us what we want but I think we can do a little bit better so I've I've written one up that we can look at over here which is the final one that I'm going to use now the cool thing about promptable is that you can put an input variable in or you can put variables into the prompt that you can sort of earmark for having user input in from your site or from your application so if you can see down the bottom here I've got an input field and this input field is connected to the input thing on the right so whatever I type in here is going to essentially insert that when I submit it now if we go over this entire prompt that I've read and I've done a little bit of role prompting you are a stock life coach you're an expert on teachings and literature of the stock grades like Epictetus and Max relius and Seneca you use the wisdom of these means to help the clients of your life coaching business who seek help from you in their day-to-day struggles you only quote stock philosophers of Seneca Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius to your clients and Below I've used what's called a few shot prompt to essentially teach this model what were the expected kind of outputs are and what also what the expected inputs are going to be so I've gone through a couple different question and answer situations so I've gone recently I've been struggling with my business it's not performing well as I've expected and then I've given what I deem to be an appropriate quote from Seneca and I've done this a couple times with a bit of variation to the author is so by the end of it we've covered a range of topics being broke break up not getting what you want and at the end of it we can now take the user input in this input field and get the outputs now I've got an input here which is my friend has wronged me and I'm having trouble forgiving him so if we submit that so the answer it gave us back is if you want to improve be content to be thought foolish and stupid by Epictetus which I think is a pretty appropriate answer to it depending on how you interpret it but now that we're finished with our prompting we need to head over to Bubble the no code platform that I'm going to be using for the video and start building the site and so here we are in bubble bubble is a no code not only website builder but they say you can build SAS applications and all sorts of things and essentially I'd say no code development platform there's there's plenty of depth to it so if you want to get really funky with it and build something bigger than just a basic web application like I'm trying to do here and you can definitely do that but for the purpose of this video we're going to go in here and create a new app and I'm going to call this thing stoic Mentor one thing you need to understand when we're doing this is that what we are creating is essentially a web application now you may be familiar with websites but essentially everything that you do in in modern web is actually a web application so there is a front end and there is a back-end and the reason we need to use something like bubble is because doing this processing of the API and taking in user input and sending it off is essentially it back and function that we need to perform so something like bubble allows us to do a lot of work on this and manage a backing without having to set up a big full step application and host it so this allows us to do sort of more complex functionality without any other house for that window we have to go through now we just go through the basic setup process on Bubble we want a hero shot at the top I think we can put one of these down here so this is all just drag and drop which is nice and easy to get started and so you have mapped out the bones of our website which is going to be a header a hero shot a little title and image here and then this is going to be our tool here I'm going to customize this uh this form here and then I'm going to do a little bit of cool stoicism kind of lore here so there we have in a couple seconds we've built up the bones of it we can have a look at it on a preview which is all looking pretty nice so nothing too fancy here we can get stuck into customizing this now so what we're going to do here is customize this form to just take a single input and have the correct button on it so I'm going to delete a bunch of this so we're going to focus first on the back end and getting the functionality of the site sort of first and then we can dress it up afterwards so our main focus right now is getting our app connected to the open AI API so we can start making calls to the uh gpt3 API so we're going to start doing that by firstly naming these fields so we know what we're talking about you can double click on them and then you change it up here so this will be get was done button now that's all named we can go to plugins and you have the API connector plugin we need to add another API and now we need to start building out our API connection and call this open AI so here you can see what we need to essentially wrap up and put into that API connector on Bubble we have a the URL that we're going to be calling to it's going to be a post request the content type which is the application Json authorization our API key and the keyword Bearer and then we'll need to put our data in a Json object like this so we're going to hop over and start putting that all into the bubble API connector I'm going to try and make this as easy as possible because this can be a little bit complicated for someone who hasn't done this before so you're going to need to head to the add plugin section and search up API connector install the API connector so once you've got your API connector installed then you can come over and start building out the API call we can call this a stoic request so this is the name that we're going to be using when we're building out the actions in the back end so we need to make this identifiable change this to a post request because we're going to be posting some data and now we've got to paste in this URL here which is found in the curl thing here so this is the link you need to put in as the post request that we're calling to you need to change this to action because it's going to be an action and then we need to start creating our headers now the headers you can see here are tagged by H so what we need to do is start copy and pasting these across headers key and then value application Json I'm doing this piece by piece so you guys can see the process add another one we need to do our authorization and then be sure to type Bearer in here you have to put Bearer and then you need to go and get your API key from open AI so you can log in in order to authorize the API call you need to use one of your own API Keys now these are free to use you have a certain amount of free usage you have on your openai account so head over to platform.openai.com and create an account if you haven't already and then you can head to the personal tab in the corner click view API keys and then create a new one be sure to copy that API key and then bring it back over to Bubble once you have your API key copied you need to create a space after the word Bearer this is important Bearer space and then paste your token in and with that our header is done and now we need to add a body to our API request which is going to be found here you can see this D tag shows you what the the data is supposed to be essentially so we need to model The Prompt that we want to ask it the max tokens and a bunch of other settings now good thing is we can take what we have over on promptable I'm going to copy it and take it over to playground just a new playground I'm going to see which my settings Works 0.9 280 so on text DaVinci 003 0.9 temperature that should be enough length put a little bit more just to be sure and then what we can do is hit view code and then this is going to give us that all ready to go we can just copy this from the bracket down to the other bracket and copy this over to our Json body here now that we have everything ready and put into our API Core Body we need to do one more thing which is to change that Dynamic value so we're able to access it when we're using our site and taking user input and so head to the input area down the bottom and change this to an angle bracket open and close around the input now this is going to be a dynamic value as you see it popped up down here we're going to say input and then a value we can put in a a sample value and test this API call now if we set this all up correctly what we can do is input a value here like my dog died which is going to replace this input here initialize the call and and everything has worked as we expected we've got a returned values from our stock request if you click the show raw data here you see how it's broken down and these things above are going to essentially fetch the different things out of this this response body so we have a text field here which is going to be the quote back which is what we wanted text and it's given us an Epictetus quote so everything's working as expected and now we have the response from our stoic request look looks a bit complicated but it really isn't that so now that we have it all connected we can head back over to our design and start connecting this up to our front end sorry to interrupt guys but I just thought I'd let you guys know that I'm finally accepting Consulting clients so if you want to have a chat with me and book in an hour call then it's available in the description talking about your business ideas anything like this I'll tell you how I would do it and the feasibility of it Etc so hit down below uh check out the Consulting Link in the description and in the pin comment and if you're enjoying the video please leave me a like by now it really really helps my channel and I'd really appreciate it if you could drop me a like so back to the video what we also need on this page is a text element to show the response from the API once we've got it so people are going to put in their struggle hit the button it's going to go to the API come back and now we need to display that text in a dynamic text asset on the page okay so we have this here Center align it we need to set up the back end logic for what happens when this get wisdom button is clicked so if you double click on get wisdom you can go start and edit workflow you come over here add an action and we have added our stoic request as an action so we can start off here so we need to set up what's called a state and this state is something that can be toggled on and off so you need to click on the text box here conditional and there's tabs up on the right and we'll Define a new condition click this text and then get down the bottom create a new custom State we're going to call that a stoic response and a state type of text and then we're going to want it to be not empty so when it's not empty that's going to be the state that we're looking for now that we've set up the State Management we can head back to our workflow for the button so we can go get wisdom start need a workflow so we've got the style Quest set up now we need to toggle the state change for the text response area that we've just set up so the startup request is triggered when the the button is clicked and then it needs to toggle the state to display the generated text so we click on here click to add an action element actions set State be sure to head back and change the name of the responsibility of text where the quote will be displayed so it's memorable I'm just going to call it quotext and head back to your workflow set the element up here as quote text and then the custom response is going to be stock response so when we click on result of step one it's going to be referencing the the big body of response we got back that big chunk of Json and all the different fields so we're going to start digging through that and trying to pluck out that text field that we want so we can head here choices first item text so with this value result of Step one's choices first items text essentially digs through that response and plucks out the text that we want as simple as I can put it this workflow we've just created is when the button is clicked it takes the input from that the user has provided includes that in our API core which we've called a stoic request sends that off when it comes back it digs through and finds that text value that we want which contains the quote and then it's updating the state of that final quote area down the bottom to include and have the value of the quote that we just got back from the request so what the dynamic value of this is going to be is the quote text so the name of the field itself this this text and it's going to be the stove response we have the dynamic value set up now we can preview the site and see if it's all working now I can put in here my dog guide ask for wisdom it's going to send the API request and hopefully it's going to show us quote back it is not the size of things which produce the greatest effect on the sole but the sides of the view we take on them so we've got everything working in the back end maybe we can play around with the display of this a little bit but essentially we have created a website that's going to take in some user input package it up with a prompt we've written query the API get the response back and display it for the user so now I'm going to go through and and tidy this all up and make it look nice and then we have a finer product so I'll be back in a second and now we're back with the completed site I'm going to give you a quick look through on the editor and then I'm going to show you the live product so I've made a little logo up here for the stoic Mentor I put in some appropriate text a stoic Mentor for life's toughest battles AI powered personalized wisdom you need from History's Greatest Minds so I've got these buttons get wisdom get wisdom and they all link down to this section here put in a bit of a nice nice Roman style image here and I've put in a bit of context down the bottom as well regarding uh who these quotes are going to be from and the kind of lives they've lived so this is the editor side and then we have the finished product The Stoke mentor.com and we have the finished product here now I'm pretty happy with how this came out given it was only a few hours work but we have these buttons here get wisdom that takes you down to this get wisdom take you down to this of course and then we can prompt in here I've hidden the text field so we can put and then we have a response from Seneca what holds sorrow isn't the passing of time but us clinging to it very easy to do and I hope the the tutorial side of things of the the nitty-gritty of bubble which can be a little bit confusing uh was enough for you and I'm going to put this in the description if you have any questions then please hit down below and I'll be sure to ask them a call because I can but I'm a beginner to Bubble too I haven't used this thing before but I was able to pick it up with a little bit of tutorial help and uh just trial and error guys this is the kind of stuff that you need to be playing around with they're getting familiar with if you want to be building AI based businesses in the future like Paul Jacobian said in the interview I did with them it's all about building fast and getting things out in like a week and if you can't do it in a week you'll do it in a few days like really push yourself to be playing around with these tools and getting stuck in and learning like I'm learning so much just by shooting these videos with you guys so there's like bubble editor I was not familiar with that but I've learned how to use it so I really urge you guys to hop in start playing around with these tools if you like this kind of AI entrepreneurship focused content I make videos three times a week or more hit down below and subscribe hit the Bell so you don't miss the next one because I have some bangers coming up soon I've got an entire will deal with great ideas I can't wait to share with you guys uh so please hit down below leave a like if you enjoyed the video I really really appreciate it and leave a comment if you have any questions but that's all for today thank you so

Titans like chamath polyhapatia have already confirmed that artificial intelligence is the next hype cycle within Silicon Valley and the startup world if you were looking to take part in this once in a lifetime opportunity to build a valuable business and to build the life of your dreams and you were in exactly the right place this video is My five-step ultimate beginner's guide to AI entrepreneurship and the best part for you is I figured all these steps out the hard way so you don't have to and finally at the end of the video I'm going to be explaining to you the three easiest AI business formats that people are exploiting right now that you can take and copy and paste into different Industries to start building your wealth and cash flow step one what is AI artificial intelligence or AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence within machines that are designed to think and act like humans essentially AI attempts to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence by this definition AI has already replaced humans and data entry medical diagnosis from detection and customer service in cases like these there are multiple benefits to creating AI systems that can perform these tasks lower cost infinite scalability no human error and data back decision making the benefits of creating artificial intelligence systems to replace humans and tasks like these is that once created and trained the artificial intelligence does not need to take a break it doesn't complain it doesn't need days off the term AI itself can actually be quite confusing as there's a number of different aspects that sort of get thrown in the mix at the same time turns out AI is actually an umbrella term which many of the other categories that you may be familiar with fall under machine learning natural language processing or NLP computer vision Robotics and many others machine learning or ml is a core aspect of artificial intelligence and it's the process of giving a computer a ton of information so that it can learn off that information and then start to predict outcomes so that we don't have to tell it what to do every single time for example a machine learning model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its size area and room or a machine learning model could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam all you need to do is provide it with a ton of labeled examples of what is spammable what isn't spam natural language processing is another core aspect of the AI tools that we're familiar with today which helps computers to understand interpret and generate human language like when you're talking to Syria or Alexa early on I had a bit of trouble understanding the distinction between these terms but easiest way to understand it is that AI is the umbrella term and these different disciplines are combined together to make these products like chat gbt or like Suri or Robotics and warehouses as well so they come together to form the final product which is intelligence step two understanding large language models due to the record-breaking public reception of chat gbt the hottest Topic in AI right now is large language models large language models or llms are Advanced AI algorithms that generate human-like text they are trained on enormous amounts of data and work by breaking down text into components learning patterns and then using that knowledge to generate new text and of course the larger the training data set the more accurate the model becomes gpt3 by openai is the language model that chat CPT was built on top of and is arguably the best publicly available large language model we have today it was trained on hundreds of billions of words and its successor gpt4 will likely be many times that the easiest way to think about these models is to imagine them as extremely powerful autocomplete engines given just a few words these large language models can write an entire short story or paragraph by pulling on similar collections of words within their training data furthermore they are excellent at pattern recognition and pattern generation allowing us to carefully craft the kinds of output that we want out of them the biggest opportunity for us as entrepreneurs right now is to be building applications on top of these hugely powerful models companies like Google and openai are doing all of the hard work of building these massive language models all we need to do is go and apply them to specific use cases in order to build these applications and build on top of these models we need access to them programmatically which brings us to our next step understanding apis apis or application programming interfaces are how entrepreneurs like us can get access to the power of these models and start building value on top of them apis can be a little bit complicated so here's an analogy to break it down for you just like you order food off a menu at a restaurant a program American access specific functionality from a software application through the API in our case we have apis that allow us access to Services by companies like open Ai and soon to be Google and others for example the options on open ai's menu are the different sub models that they've trained that are good for different purposes the options on this menu range from DaVinci to Ada with DaVinci being their most advanced language model that powers things like chat GPT down to Ada which is only capable of doing very very basic functionality they also have some models that are specialized towards code rather than language so they offer a whole bunch of different options for you to access programmatically and build your applications on top of we can interact with these models and leverage their power by making what's called an API call to them within these calls you need to provide a bit of information to specify what you want back for example say we are creating a resume creation tool we would need to collect user input containing their personal information such as email phone number work history through a site or a form combine that information with some simple instructions explaining to the API what we want to do and then we bundle that all together and send it off in a call AP API would then process our request and send back the response because this is all done programmatically once you have the reliable way of collecting user input and you have those instructions that you send off to the API written perfectly then you are able to take this repeat it over and over again and scale it into a business however the writing of these instructions is an entirely separate skill in itself step four understanding prompt engineering this skill is actually so important that I've already done an entire video for it on my channel which will be linked at the end of the video but for now I'll give you a brief summary the correct term for instructing an artificial intelligence to do a task is known as prompting we tell the AI for example open AIS gpt3 a set of instructions and it performs a task based on those instructions prompts can be as simple as a phrase or a question or as complex as multiple paragraphs the reason prompt engineering or simply how you create your prompts is so important is because of a concept called garbage and garbage out essentially the quality of your input determines the quality of your output when you have large language models as powerful as gpt3 and others your ability to write good prompts determines the value that you can extract from them entire businesses are being built on the back of a few well-written prompts or even just one be sure to watch my prompt engineering guide which will be linked at the end of the video so that you can get this foundational skill online and finally what you've all been waiting for step five is the easiest ways that you can build on top of these large language models now that you've been brought up to speed on all the different aspects of AI entrepreneurship you need to start piecing it all together and of course the big question is how can you use all of this knowledge to not only identify but execute on your next big idea and so here are the three best AI business formats that you can start copy and pasting into different Industries today and I'm saving the best one for last business format number one is prompt based businesses this business format requires you to find a specific use case and then write one or many really well crafted prompts that convert these large language models into tools for that specific use case once you've played around and constructed these prompts then all you need to do is Host this on a website and start marketing it the simplest way to do this is to write a good price prompt taken some user input from your website mash them together and send it off from the API call and what comes back can be a really customized response for people and it looks like magic to them but under the hood it's very low effort and very basic to get one of these up and running because you're essentially just taking a large language model like gpt3 giving it some instructions shoving in some user input and then letting it run the response back for example you could use an AI powered resume writing tool and then craft a prompt that shows gpt3 the kind of format the best possible format for a resume and then include that in the prompt and then include the user information send it off an API call and get it back and give that to the user or you can create some interesting copywriting tools like copy.ai have done for example you could create a Facebook ad ugc copy Creator which takes in some information on the company the products and will always spread out a nice Facebook ad copy that includes quotations and product reviews on it out of the three this has the lowest barrier of Entry as essentially all you need to do is write a good prompt playing around with building these basic prompt based tools is the perfect way to get your feet wet without entrepreneurship so I strongly urge you guys to get into the open AI playground and start having a play around writing some prompt and seeing what you can get out of these models I actually have a full build and take to Market Video on a prompt business like this where I went from idea to prompt to business and taking it to Market that's going to be dropping sometime this week so make sure you're subscribed and you hit the Bell so you don't miss that one business format number two is a fine tune based business large language models like gpt3 can be fine-tuned I actually already have a video on fine tuning on my channel using a very basic example so that's going to be linked in the description for you guys to check out after this essentially fine tuning allows you to teach a model to recognize new patterns chat GPT is an excellent example of this because openai has fine-tuned gpt3 the underlying language model in order to operate in a q a Style by training it and giving it some examples of question and answer style prompt fine tuning can be used to create tools that improve a large language model for a specific purpose for example you could fine-tune one of these models to become an expert social media sentiment analysis bot all you need to do is get a ton of Twitter comments Instagram comments Facebook comments label them as positive or negative and then you can pipe that into the model to fine tune it the resulting fine tune model will be better at predicting the positive or negative sentiment of social media comments than the underlying gpt3 model itself while gpt3 can already do sentiment analysis on its own by providing it with these examples you're making it sort of more Niche down to being better at dealing with social media comments in particular the most difficult part about this business format is that you need appropriate data to fine-tune with this is where some light bulbs may be going off for you guys because if you own a business or you know someone who does who has a ton of valuable and interesting data that could be used to fine-tune these models for a different purpose and you have an excellent opportunity to use that data fine tune it and create a new software as a service and as with most things an artificial intelligence and AI the more data you can provide it with the better the model will perform sorry to interrupt the video guys but if you're enjoying please hit down below and leave me a like now it really helps my channel out so sorry to interrupt but back to the video now and finally the business format number three that I think has the most potential is a custom data chat bot business now don't switch off because you've heard the word chatbot hear me out if you can get your hands on some valuable data be it through your own business or a friend or you reach out to someone and offer to partner with them and create this chat service if you can be the first people in your Niche to provide some kind of chatbot service then you have a really good chance of making some serious money the main opportunity that I see for these chat Bots is making complex database structured data available in simple and easy to access ways to Consumers the issue of getting data into these models so that they can be used for different use cases was something that puzzled me for a long time recently I connected the dots that you can use these models to convert natural language like a sentence into a database query this essentially allows you to convert any database you have with some interesting data in it into a chatbot service one example of this in action could be an e-commerce reporting assistant for brand owners this assistant could take in a natural language prompt like what were the three best performing products for the month of December in Norway based on conversion rate you can send that information off to an API endpoint and receive it back in a database query you can use to look up your database pull that data format it into a nice sentence and then give it back to the user if I've just turned a light on in your head you're going to want to subscribe and hit the Bell because I've got more videos coming on this exact topic showing you guys how you can do this and apply to to your databases you are now equipped with enough information to get out there and start sniffing out those life-changing opportunities that are going to be popping up everywhere the best part about you reaching the end of this video is that you're still so early you not only have a knowledge Advantage but you also have a Time Advantage the rest of the world is only just waking up to the huge opportunities Nai right in front of us so you need to pay your advantage to the fullest so if you've gotten anything out of this video please leave

just a few carefully crafted sentences and that's no exaggeration if you give me just 15 minutes of your time I will not only unpack this highly lucrative skill and take you step by step through learning it but also share with you exactly how myself and others have been using the skill to make money and build businesses and no you don't need any coding experience this guide is intended for anyone looking to add this foundational skill of prompt engineering to their toolkit so they can access more opportunities with an AI so what is prompt Engineering in plain English prompting is the process of instructing an AI to do a task we tell the AI for example gpt3 a set of instructions and it performs a task based on those instructions prompts can vary in complexity from a phrase to a question to multiple paragraphs worth of text I'm sure you've all played around with chat GPT the text that you provide in that dialog box is your prompt however most of the value created through prompting is not done with chat gbt more on this later the reason prompt engineering or more simply put how you construct your prompts is so important and so valuable is because of a concept called garbage and garbage out essentially the quality of your input determines the quality of your output when you have large language models like gpt3 that are massive and are just a soup of data your ability to write great prompts directly determines your ability to extract value from them the importance of prompt engineering can be Illustrated with a simple example here in open AIS playground here on screen we have a basic Mouse equation and if I submit that you'll see that it actually comes back with an incorrect answer this simple error can easily be fixed with a little bit of prompt engineering here I've added make sure to put the right amount of zeros even if there are many and just like that we have the correct answer of 9 billion as you can see changing your prompting just a little bit can have drastic effects on having a correct or incorrect answer while extremely obvious on simple math tasks like this these slight prompt differences can have an enormous effect on more complex tasks all this begs the question how can we make prompts that yield optimal results on any task this question is the core focus of prompt engineering within this video we will be using the open AI playground for our prompting it is crucial to understand that the playground is not the same as chat GPT if you're unfamiliar with the playground it provides us with a flexible platform that we can interact with all of the open AI Suite of products in their natural state and by natural state I mean the form that we get access to them through the open AI apis this is important to understand because anything that you can achieve within the playground can then be scaled and then productized and sold more on that later if you didn't know chat TPT is actually an application that openai has built on top of the gpt3 model that we're going to be accessing through the playground the difference is that openai significantly changed gpt3 in order to make chat GPT the reinforcement learning and fine-tuning and a bunch of other fun stuff long story short chat GPT may be fun and valuable in its own right but if you're looking to create value and build scalable business on top of these models you need to be learning how to engineer the base models in their natural state this is because these base level models are the only things that we can get access to through the apis currently and therefore the only new things that we can build businesses on top of therefore learning how to engineer prompts for the base models through the playground is going to be the focus of this video enough talking let's jump into the playground and start prompting here we have on screen a very simple prompt that uses the power of large language models like gpt3 and its understanding of language to convert a mixed bag of first and last names and then order them in last first order here you can see I've given John Doe Liam otley Peterson Mike and then it's going to Output this in last first formatting next up we have a carefully crafted prompt that allows us to remove personal information from our email The Prompt says read the following sales email Remove any personally identifiable information and replace it with the appropriate placeholder for example replace the name John Doe with name and then we have pasted in a sales email example if we submit this the response we get back is the same email with all of the personal information removed it says hi name so it's removed the name and it's also known to remove the phone number and email address as well being able to achieve this result within the playground means that we can then take this exact same prompt and apply it to a larger scale and run it through your agency or something get these exact same results done on mass while we're here I'll give you a rundown of the important settings that you can play around with in the sidebar first and probably most importantly you can change the model that you're using to interact with openai has a ton of different models for different purposes for example we have code related models here which are more capable of understanding code we have some of my fine tunes from my personal account and then we have different versions of DaVinci Ada all these different ones that basically serve different functions and if you look here it would tell you a little bit of a blurb about what each of these things do and what it's good at you may be thinking why would I not just use the best one which is DaVinci 3 at the current time this is because the pricing for each of these models is actually different if you want to use these models for a very basic pattern recognition task you shouldn't be paying more and using the top model DaVinci 3 you could be using Curie or adder or something much lower that does what you need and nothing you don't the next and second most important thing you can play around with is the temperature the temperature setting is crucial because it determines the randomness of your output some tasks like creative writing or ideation would perform better if you increase the randomness but in many cases having the temperature at basically zero is going to be better if you want those rigid deterministic outputs setting the temperature at zero can often be a very good way to ensure that you get the same results from essentially the same input next is the max length setting which is an extremely important part of your prompt rating these models have a strict limit on how much data that you can pack into both the prompt and the response you get back from the model this means that both the prompt that you write and the expected response cannot go over 4 000 tokens one token is equal to roughly four characters in normal English text the max length setting determines the length of the response that it will give back to you so it's important to do a little bit of quick math and see at the bottom of the screen here how many tokens you've taken up with your prompt and then essentially Max your maximum length for the response to be not over 4 000 tokens in total and then here we have a few minor settings you can play around with such as the frequent penalty and the presence penalties in some cases these are very useful because you might notice that it's repeating the same thing over and over and you don't want that or you want it to talk about new topics more often which will help you with the present penalty now that's out of the way we can teach you your first method of prompting which is role prompting in role prompting if you couldn't figure it out from the name you are going to use prompt in order to set the AI into a certain role for example in your prompt you could include you are a doctor or you are a lawyer and then start asking it legal or medical questions here on screen we have another maths problem to illustrate this role prompting now if I submit this I get 280 as my result back which is incorrect now if I go a few lines above it and I add in this little role prompting section suddenly the answer changes we get the answer of 1400 which is actually the correct answer what we've done here is told it that it is a brilliant mathematician who can solve any problem in the world so this is setting it into a role of being a mathematician or we can do what apps like chat GPT have done and set the model into a personal assistant friendly helpful bot mode here's an example of a prompt that turns the model into a helpful AIS system on-screen is an example of a basic prompt that turns the model into a friendly AI assistant using adjectives like helpful creative clever and very friendly to to Really set that mode as a helpful friendly clever assistant and we also have a few examples here as well now that it's been set into this mode I'm able to ask it a question should I shop online for my groceries or go to the supermarket let's see what it gives us and just like that we've got a chat gpt-like response which is a friendly helpful response to our question setting modes like we've just done is one of the fundamental tools within your prompt engineering toolkit when assigning a role to an AI we're helping it by giving it more context with this context the AI is able to better understand the question and not surprisingly with better understanding of the question and the AI will give better answers you may have noticed in that last prompt we've actually shown it an example of one interaction between the human and the bot this brings us to our next method of shot prompting shot prompting can be broken down into three categories zero shot one shot and few shot prompting using these shot prompting methods are the easiest way I've found to build businesses with AI right now more on that later in the video Zero shot prompting is essentially using the AI as an autocomplete engine You're simply giving it a question or a phrase and giving it free reign to reply to that without any expected structure zero shot prompting is what we've been doing to most of the video already so simple stuff like what is the capital of France Paris any kind of question Humpty Dump D here you can see I've put the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme but just a few words of it and it's completed it for me using xero shot prompting is essentially using these large language models as a massive autocomplete engine and again going back to our previous example of the mathematician role prompting this is also zero shot we haven't provided any structure or expectations on how to answer it the AI is just going to look at this and say this is how I'm going to reply it's no expected structure this time it's gone forward the answer is 1400 it could have just gone 1400 or it could have said the answer to this question is 1400 so we haven't provided it with any structure on how we want this answer to be given back which brings us on to one shot prompting here's an example of one shot prompt being mixed with a bit of role prompting as well so up top we have a little bit of information to set it in a highly intelligent question answering bot roll and below it we have a One-Shot example of an interaction between the user and the AI now when I enter my question within this now when I ask it a question it's not only going to take into account the role prompt above but also look at the structure and how it interacted in the one shot prompt above and here we have the answer which is Michael Phelps won a total of 28 meters including 23 Gold these two pairs of answers and responses are very similar it's looked at the pattern and looked at the structure of the one above and it's answered it in the same way matching the tone and length of it and finally we have few shot prompting few shot prompting is done by giving more than one example of how you want the AI to respond on screen I have a little prompt made up of a YouTube video idea generator what I've done is set up a question and answering pair so this is the question YouTube video ideas for selling products on tiktok and then I've given it 10 examples that I just took from chat GPT and put in there this data here is really important and if you're you're trying to use few shot to get a particular result the things you're putting in as examples mattered a lot now if I add in the rest of the prompt I have this next part which is the second shot of the few shot prompt the YouTube video ideas for why you should try digital Banks and I've given another five examples here so all I need to do now is to paste in another question YouTube video ideas for how to make money with chat GPT and the AI is going to look at my previous shot prompt and then give me a answer based on the structure and content of those previous prompts and just like that we've taken gpt3 and turned it into a YouTube video idea generator which is based on the kind of styles that I like in titles which are provided here using the few shot method by adding in more and more examples you're able to more precisely Define the kind of output that you want crucial aspects of your response like the tone length and structure can all be determined by the examples that you provide a simple example would be a q a bot like we have on screen here when prompted with a question at the end here the AI is going to take a look at the role prompt at the top get set into the roll and then look through all of these examples provided and go okay these are the kinds of responses that I'm expected to give these are how long they are this is the tone of voice this is the structure so this is how you teach it to give you the kind of results that you want if for example you were to take these answers and expand on them and make them a whole paragraph and did that for each and every question then when you ask it a question it's going to give you back a full paragraph as well it's important to understand why shop prompting works so well and this is because large language models are essentially just pattern recognition and generation machines another handy tool to have in your prompt engineering toolkit in order to extract the most value value out of these models it's called Chain of Thought prompting Chain of Thought prompting encourages the large language model to explain its reasoning as it goes through the steps which typically results in better and more accurate results the increase in accuracy is particularly noted in arithmetic common sense and symbolic reasoning tasks on screen we have a word equation that's asking what is the faster way to get to work now if I submit this the answer I get back is that option 1 is the faster way to work but we find out when we change the prompt is that that was actually the incorrect answer as you can see on screen if we change the prompt around and make it explain the thinking it actually comes up with a different answer which is option two let's take a look at this a little bit more closely to understand why it works what we have here is a One-Shot prompt where it's providing us with one example of how we want things done which is a faster way home option one so this is the question which is the same as the question that we had just slightly different and what we've done is written out how we want it to respond so it's going to look at the structure and go okay that's how they want me to do it and then so when we ask this question it's going to do the exact same process of thinking things about step by step and then we get the correct answer which is option two now Chain of Thought prompting like this is really handy for these specific kinds of tasks it's a great thing to have in your toolkit as a prompt engineer another method of doing Chain of Thought prompting is actually called zero shot Chain of Thought prompting now if we add this magic little phrase let's think step by step to our zero shot prompt we get a bit of a different answer to what we got before and just like that we've gotten the correct answer which is option two by asking it to think step by step for us now you may be thinking what's the difference between a a single shot and a zero shot Chain of Thought answer like this while it's very easy in this situation to create a single shot or few shot prompt by thinking up a few examples and tweaking this question around a bit when the task is far more complex sometimes getting multiple examples or even just a single example to use in a shot prompt is not possible therefore this little magic phrase of let's think step by step can be the difference between extracting correct and incorrect answers with your prompts so now that you understand the basics we can get into what you're really here for which is what are the biggest opportunities for prompt engineers in 2023 and Beyond experts like Dr Alan d Thompson have said that we have one to two years where prompt engineering will be extremely valuable but soon will be replaced by artificial intelligences who can write their own prompts So within this two-year period how can we get the most out of this highly lucrative skill first and most obvious is to sell your services as a prompt engineer demand for this skill is exploding right now give yourself a month or two to learn it and become an expert and then start going out and trying to find your own gigs companies around the world are hiring for this right now so all you need to do is learn the skill and get out there and start knocking on doors the second opportunity that I see is to create a teaching business out of prompt engineering we're going to see companies all across the world have to Pivot towards understanding and using these models one of the easiest ways for these companies to tap into this AI Revolution that's happening and start to use these tools to increase the productivity of their business and employees is to teach them how to use these tools if you can go into these companies and teach them skills like prompt engineering and give them a suite of tools that they can use to improve their productivity then you're going to have some seriously good opportunities to start making money by selling to these big companies and finally my favorite way of making money with prompt engineering is by building businesses around a one well-written prompt we are seeing extreme amounts of value being unlocked with just one well-written prompt an awesome example of this is Lita AI by Dr Alan d Thompson if you haven't looked into them already I suggest you check them out I'll leave a link in the description to his channel but what he's done is basically taken a gpt3 model written up a very very specific prompt and with that prompt he's basically created this AI assistant called Leader by writing such a quality prompt he's able to create a AI that has exactly the right character that he wants and what he's done is set up a webcam and he's been interacting face to face talking to this AI and sharing it with the world while I don't think he's monetized it yet and it's more of a research project it is insane seeing what just a few sentences of well-written text can do to transform these language models which are so powerful into these entirely new and uh powerful things in their own right but a much more direct way of making money right now is looking at how you can write a prompt to create a tool that you can sell one example of a little gimmicky tool that you could make is uh Ed Sheeran song generator that I've been playing around with in a wrote a prompt for that you guys can see on screen here now what I've done here is taken the lyrics to supermarket flowers which is the output that I want and I'll put the topic as buying Supermarket flowers for my grandmother as she is ill and then I've pasted in some example lyrics from Ed Sheeran which is actually the shape of you verse and chorus and then I've done it again and I've put in falling in love with a girl from Galway then I've given it the same example to learn his style from which is the shape of you chorus and verse and then I've put in the output which is lyrics directly from Galway Girl and here we have my topic loving a girl who lives far away missing her more every day and if I hit enter on that then it's going to give us out a entire song in the style of Ed Sheeran based on the topic that I'm I've given now while very gimmicky of course this is an example of how you can use prompts and pulling in different bits of data and pulling in user input in order to create a little tool if you took this and put it on a website and did a little bit of marketing and I'm sure you'd be able to get some money coming in off the back of one of these very basic tools if you're not subscribed already then make sure you do because my next video I'm going to be doing something just like this taking it to Market and seeing how much money I can make so I'm going to be giving you the behind the scenes of that in my next video on my channel I've talked about fine tuning before but I seriously think doing prompt engineering like this to alter these models is an even lower barrier to entry for people looking to build businesses with AI all it takes is one carefully written prompt and maybe a little bit of user input matched together and you can create a valuable business in like half an hour so now you know the basics of prompt engineering you can go out there and start practicing it more start selling your services start teaching people or start building businesses based off writing prompts if you've got anything out of this please hit down below and leave me a like subscribe to the channel if you're

simple build and launch in any in the time frame needs to be under a week the last time we saw this was the phone hello everyone and welcome back to the channel my name is Liam Motley your number one scores for AR entrepreneurship content today we're joined by a very special guest uh Paul Jacobian founder of copy Ai and one of the leading AI writing Platforms in the market today so welcome on Paul thank you so much for coming on I really appreciate your time today thanks it's great to be here first off thank you for coming on I know you have some great insights to share with the community and I would love to hear more about copy Ai and why it's so great so start off uh can you tell us a little bit about your background and what led you to AI entrepreneurship as you are today sure yeah so my background's a little bit varied all over the place uh started out as a CPA doing accounting uh out of out of college uh one of the finance uh industry at a hedge fund and then learn you know about the finance stuff the bookkeeping stuff but that was really all kind of boring and and uh wasn't quite as exciting as real entrepreneurship really operating companies and so I ended up moving into the startup World um helping a family member um grow one of her companies that she had started and left that for venture capital in 2016 and that's where I met my current co-founder we were helping employees exercise their stock options at Adventure backed startups and we were really interested in the next big waves we were trying to figure out all right what is the next thing what is the nature of these like technological changes that really Spurs you know rapid expansion and technological progress and we you know we'd seen a lot of AI companies unfortunately it seemed like a lot of the Technologies were pretty Niche for very specific verticals and so it wasn't like a broad-based technology that could be applied to all kinds of use cases really easily and then in late 2019 we got to test out gpt2 which was really the first um that was really the first generative kind of tech that I had used personally and what was really fascinating stood out Liam is you would type something in there and let it autocomplete and then it would come up like you could get it to come up with crazy stuff like crazy new stuff and then you'd Google it and you wouldn't find any search results for the thing that it created and that was really the aha moment for me I was like man if you could create anything then the ROI from this technology is um unlimited because that means that there is no capped amount of value it could create if you let it Loose it can go create really anything um like things you can't even imagine and so this idea that creativity would be the first real use case of it um to us was pretty clear the the whole point of it is to get it to like do things that are interesting and creative and original and even now um this is still something that we want out of these out of these generative models um we thought it'd be about seven years before it could be like commercially viable in a uh Enterprise context but uh fast forward six months and they launched gpt3 and in the 20 in the summer of 2020 and then immediately because the model you know was about a hundred times the size and they you know trained it with more data it did actually hit that Tipping Point and so it it went from one in Ten kind of results being good to around nine out of ten um and then if you if you created you know multiple examples it'd be a prompting you could actually get it to do a task repeatedly pretty well and so at that moment in time um my my co-founder and I we just kind of said all right we got this is it like this is this is the wave it starts right now and so we started um launching MVP little side projects we got instant access like we got access as fast as we could to the uh the gbt3 API and then um watch about five MVPs in two and a half months and then um each time we launch we learn something new and we figured out you know a better way to replicate what we were doing on the back end from an engineering scene so this was this was already going into the the uh the call BI side of things or you were just playing around with anything you could get your hands on and seeing what you could do with the gpt3 uh that yeah so we you know it's just like fun fun projects you know you don't know where you don't know what it's gonna take off so it wasn't like we quit our jobs to do you know to do a startup it wasn't like that um but we got to do like five different things we built a summarization uh tool that got mentioned in the Long Street Journal I was like all right that's cool people use it like let's go do something else let's keep going um and then we ended up building a site called taglines.ai which was just a tagline generator that's all it did and so you just type in your product uh name or product description and it would just generate the tagline that thing took off we had over 2 000 people um try that on use that in like the first week or so and um we started to see people use it for all these different marketing and sales use cases um for email copy website copy and so it really validated that there were a lot of use cases that could use um some tooling like that and then we also found out you know we're thinking oh this is like a it's just for marketers and as it turns out you got all kinds of users using the tools and finding value in them and so that really validated and we also set up like a little stripe paywall highly recommend figuring out if anybody will pay you for the thing you built quickly and so yeah so within the first week we validated one people would know how to how to use the interface two that the use cases were varied like they're kind of related but there were a lot of use cases people are using these tools for uh three that all kinds of users would use it not just like the hyper Focus like copywriter so we went back to the drawing board and said okay we have literally one tool that's all this thing does let's go build like a suite of them we rebranded it as copy.ai we launched that and that that took off uh relatively quickly and so with with the like tagline generator in terms of the a lot of these the startups right now a front running what the users are putting in with a sort of pre-prompt to gpd3 correct so a lot of the stuff on copy to AI is like setting up a preset uh angle that you've gone down with gbt3 and then users put the input on top of that right so is that how you do that to them that's how you get it started yeah you've been strapped your data set with prompts but then over time you end up taking the data feedback from users and fine-tuning tools for that use case yeah that's one of my big questions for you because as I I see it there's this sort of direct usage of gpt3 and the API which is let's just use it for for prompt and completion calls and then we're going to be a little bit cheeky about it and we'll do a sort of pre-prompt uh to gbt3 to get it to understand a certain scenario and then we're going to let users build on top of that that preset scenario so um and then I guess is the fine-tuning side of things which from my own experimenting with seems quite um difficult to understand at what point it eventually becomes a flexible understanding of something so could you talk a little bit about your experience with fine tuning and your results and I guess experience with getting the training data fit into gbt3 it works all right you can get it to work you need a lot of data that's that tends to be a pretty safe assumption across every kind of generative AI use case um so the more data you get the more you can train it to kind of produce the results that that your users find valuable um yeah they're all kinds of like techniques and things but it's that's a pretty standard process right now um and I guess for the users who want 100 familiar with copy AI I've played around with it I love a lot of the tools I was particularly the sort of startup focused ones to help you with ideation and and YouTube video stuff which is all great tools that I've been enjoying if you could just give a quick run through of sort of the the core in your mind the core features that you provide and an example of the target users that you typically have using your platform sure so anyone writing sales or marketing copy so if you're writing emails if you're like sales emails if you're writing emails to your users if you're needing to create like website content you can describe kind of what what kinds of content you're looking to get you describe your product or your or your company and then it'll give you ideas instantly so it's like you type that in it'll generate you know multiple sets of results for you to review and find something that that works for for your particular copywriting use case so we've we started out you know with these preset tools and um over time you know we said okay there are infinite use cases right which you can't fit into tools so what is the path forward in a world where you can do anything with us I think you've seen this with chat GPT work out pretty well where it's really open-ended and really flexible so I do think that that the chat kind of interface where you can have that feedback ex user feedback experience is going to be a really interesting interface Paradigm as well and so that's something that we're going to be uh implementing and building into the core of our product as well yeah um with uh gbt4 coming how much are you how's that affecting your strategy going forward and you gotta assume it's gonna be awesome right I mean um it'll be much more powerful than so it these models are going to end up eating both interfaces they're gonna need apis they're gonna connect the internet they're gonna eat eat up like you know uh index content I mean it's it's for real it's not just like oh you know let's carve this little niche out here it's not like that oh it's it's a um it's a very large ship sailing increase increasingly fast right and you really want to get on board that ship you want to look out as far into the distance as you can and even now people online are like oh you know AGI is so far away I'm like no no it's 20 23. this wouldn't give it a couple months that's what I said I'm like 2023 all this stuff's accelerating we already know Google has uh better models than what's probably available now and you know Larry and Sergey just came back to Google to do this so coming back you're telling me that we're not going to see massive exponential progress in an arms race in a now in a competitive environment at the base layer it's enough to pull those guys out of like essential retirement and be like I'm back in the game I'm ready to ready to make another shift um I fully agree with you on that this is um sort of a new era of of tick and it's a different different breed and like you said earlier that it's when you noticed that it was a it's going to affect a lot of areas and I think for me I remember growing up sort of the past eight years as a high school kid and stuff I was looking around like yeah we've get we've got smartphones we've got this and we've got that but like I knew that these things weren't going to be as I was like we've had this big smartphone wait what's this next big thing and in my head I couldn't figure out what this thing was and as soon as I had my first go with chat GPT I was like this is yeah this house is the big one how old are you how many 22. 22 all right I'm 35 when you don't you don't maybe remember when like phones first came out or the internet came out oh I mean that dude imagine the internet coming out you know like that was it one of those moments for you yeah the internet was for sure the internet was and then um after when you could get any song you download any song on the planet for free yeah I was using LimeWire that was LimeWire and LimeWire era I mean you downloaded it I downloaded every song every song it's on it like an external hard drive so yeah those are Paradigm shifts and your mind is exploding and then relatively quickly people just adapt to it and you're like oh yeah we have Spotify you know and it's like they just don't compute to have access to every song yeah sure of course right of course but it makes sense that we would and that's that's how technology works and Technology is a a force for making things cheaper that's how you know you have technology if it gets if things get more expensive you don't have technology when we talk about like AI products being free or not or whatnot like yeah of course like they'll be free you look at Google is free and it's incredibly valuable right they don't try to charge you for that they just said somebody has to figure out the business model so if chat CPT is going to sort of play a role like a revolution of search how would these uh chat GPT tools like that be monetized and the current strategy that they just put out it's this new thing that you see with these AI tools like mid journey and stuff that you're paying for premium access to servers and first first results and stuff but if it was yeah it's hard to imagine that that's yeah I've kind of made the search platform paid and a Charged per search initially right it killed the business overnight so it's been interesting seeing how they're going to get to that paid situation I think what they have is not a bad not a bad medium whether you can pay if you're using it for commercial purposes or using it as a as a serious uh Works person then you can get these faster access to the results I mean these models are going to be embedded into your iPhone like on on the hardware so hard to imagine those business models last being very durable right with my business partner we're talking a lot about Wiz the like you said it's going to replace the apis and like personal assistants and the stuff and it's basically just going to connect to everything we were thinking it needs to be chat gbt but you can ask it things or you make a personal assistant and then you uh develop a program that will allow it to interact with Google Sheets or your calendar or this and this and this that's very basic stuff and like you said I think that's going to become mainstream yeah I mean we have some of that some of that already exists and you can get those different connectors set up Google Sheets is going to get a massive Improvement like just the way that data gets organized is going to be incredibly it's gonna be an incredibly powerful product once they embed that in probably this year um just for the the viewers who aren't familiar with the history of copy AI could you give us a a quick rundown of funding employees your users and all of that that good stuff that I'm sure you're very proud of yeah I think we've you know we've done well we've gone the venture-backed route it was a decision that we we had to figure out um like my partner and I we had got it up to like 50 000 a month and and uh recurring Revenue before we hired our first employee and then um we ended up raising a total of 14 million dollars for for like seed round and series a and then um we've grown the team to like 34 people and um past uh 12 million now in a revenue run rate and from a user standpoint we really we very much believe in free products freemium so we've had I think we've just passed five million users sign up in this product uh this past week so we're trying to really build very long-term uh distribution around the product of the platform and we wanted you know we want to make you want to make something that people want that's really critical to who we are as a company um I think you're gonna really like when you're at it's not like 35 people it's not a huge company right Google has I think 100 20 000 or something people it's a lot of people and they have a lot of funding so if you're gonna be nimble as a startup and lean you have to you have to really play into your strengths and so when you're a lean team that means that we can be Scrappy we can build things quickly we can pivot um you know engineering teams to you know building what what you know anything that gets released at the game changer you want to integrate that really fast and all of that really accelerates your growth engine as well because users continue to find increasing amounts of value in the platform what's going to be interesting is and um still I think a little bit early to see where the um how to translate distribution and growth and usage into like really powerful business models that win and again I don't I'm not sure that charging for chat gbt you know 40 whatever dollars a month is going to really be that competitive if if Google just integrates that into they just integrated into search engines and then they're in every interface they're not going to need to be charging for it either no and they happen to Own Chrome YouTube Gmail pretty big search Android I mean they have sewn up so much distribution and then if it does end up at the hardware layer in the OS layer they um they own a lot of that too um and Apple's already you know throwing themselves in the mix as well so I think you're looking at hyper you're gonna look at a hyper competitive environment all eyes are on AI for big Tech and so I am anticipating you know very very fast Improvement here and what's your experience been like with VCS of of speaking to my business partner about getting funding for different ideas and he's always been very uh sort of against going that route because he feels like as soon as we take the money then there's going to be people over our shoulder so what's what's your experience been like and uh what's your relationship like with your your VCS our relationship's great because but we also were very fortunate to have the best species and best in our company um Venture cat there's nothing magical about Venture Capital it's just an investor right it's my investing money um as that industry has grown it's harder to bring in Founders to become investors and so if you haven't started thing you know companies before or been very very early and you really see the process of company formation and making it's very hard um outside of a very like your core expertise area to provide advice so the things that you tend to get are like introductions which are really helpful the capital itself obviously very helpful um yeah you hear horror stories though some people have really bad experiences and then the more investors you buy invite into your company the higher the odds that you're going to hit one of those really bad investors so I always recommend doing back you know reference checks with Founders that have worked with that investor over a long period of time um so yeah I'd say be do your do your diligence don't think like oh I'm tricking this person into investing you know that you're just it's not gonna work it's really not going to work and you're going to end up in a bad position so play it like a long-term game um and and do not lie ever in fundraising process yeah life is too short for that [ __ ] and people will will figure you out we'll find out yeah yeah a lot of it's reputation based so it's all reputation based because you have that's how the startup World works there's an insane amount of trust that you give to someone else um without doing reference tracks like that's how things are so efficient and move so quickly you don't need to like get a warm intro like you I think you just called message me I'm like sure I'll do a podcast you know so it's like that's how the world should work we should all trust each other and you hear these horror stories you hear these like about these startups blowing up and like you know just total outright fraud I do not want people to think that that's how it it is done or should be done and that you should expect that or you should you should behave that way um so if you're if you're um this is your business partner your business like if you're if you think that Venture capitalists are going to ruin your company you should not raise money because because you will not give them the benefit of the doubt you won't trust them and that's really critical that you do that awesome um what do you look for in core team members and co-founders I think this is a very big topic and important for for people who are watching to to get some advice from you and your experience of how did you know that the person that you co-founded copier with was someone you could trust long term and that they had the qualities that you were ready to move forward with entrusted a business relationship because business is one thing uh friendships are another and they're often a bit of a great mix when when they come together yeah I mean I'm just insanely lucky my my car it was my colleague and then he and I became friends instantly when we met and started working together so we'd already worked together for four years and uh I trust yeah trust him with my life he's he's incredible and he's you know extremely talented um engineer and and insanely like highly futuristic thinker so it's just beautiful match um I would not recommend it I know people ask like oh I need a co-founder for my company I would not recommend bringing on a co-founder you don't know or you met in the past absolutely two months the trust don't worry you gotta trust them 100 very very deeply very very deep trust and um so again would not recommend and in in hiring your sort of key uh key positions uh what have you found as a as a co-founder uh what was your process of learning learning how to hire well and I'm sure you've um run into that a lot and what have what are your things that you could recommend to people who are in the position of having to hire some really crucial staff uh what are the things that you look for or what are the red flags that will turn you off someone uh who's looking to join your company yeah for like we're a software company so yeah finding great Engineers is is like a key thing and um one of our friends was a like contract CTO so he had been CTO he'll do the initial interview screens really helped guide us through that process and then helped us find a really great head of engineering and that that's been amazing like our engineering staff is it's top top top tier and then across across the rest of the organization it it is a little bit harder like it's it's somewhat narrow to Define um you know kind of the engineering skills you're looking for and it's pretty easy to do the to get a sense of culture on the other on the other side like you know product design marketing we're looking for people that because we want to maintain a lean Focus they they have had experience doing like lots of different types of things and have a really good sense of where to focus time and how to prioritize what's important so that's worked that's worked well for us um uncovering that would just go really you know go as deep as you can into the the resume the projects they've worked on and understand how their brain works differences references and all that so those are really key I can't I can't stress references enough um and then we've also been fortunate because we we have like so so much of our companies out in the public you know online that we have a lot of applications when we post jobs job openings and so it's a it's a very big Pipeline and it actually to find people that fit what you're looking for and match like culturally um like for us optimism's huge right we're a remote company that means every time I get on a zoom call with someone else we have to feed each other energy right and so that's really really critical um in this remote world so do you know does the team have that chemistry because that's how you open up communication yeah online chemistry must be even even harder to find it's interesting it's a tough job I didn't realize you were fully remote that's it's tough yeah my co-founder is not even in the same city as I am but we had worked remotely before so we were working remotely yeah um in terms of uh as a startup founder if you're looking just to step into the the AI space and and start a business how important do you think technical ability is in a startup founder and is it 100 necessary do you need sort of a rough understanding because I know there's a lot of people looking to get into it and seeing that yes this is the future I want to try and build something here and build some value but they're so clueless when it comes to anything ml or uh machine learning or anything you know that they're just so blind on that side of things that maybe marketers coming in and they just they can't even grasp a lot of the stuff so what what are your thoughts on technical ability for startup founders um well you've got kind of two periods one is before Transformer models like gpt3 and then the second periods after that so before yeah you needed like someone with data science skills machine learning skills because he had to go find models build the right models test them in in production like that that's a whole at least a person that's just doing that after gpt3 it's literally low code so it's like you just describe what you need in this and the um you know you can Implement into an application so the technical requirement for building a company that uses AI to do something is is much lower now than it used to be um so I would incur yeah I'd encourage people you you do need to know you need to know what can what's possible like that's very important to understand technologically what is possible the hardest part is understanding it at a deep enough level to engineer your architecture in a way that makes it really flexible and modular so that that would be the thing that you'd want and then if you're a founder and you're not technical you need to be really good at at business and really understanding the business use cases and applications awesome but in terms of say building on top of gpd3 would you say um directly building on top of it and just allowing people a a nicer way to interact with it for some certain use case that's the sort of model people should be looking at or are there other areas that are also just exciting that people may not be aware of um well these models are gonna do work they're actually going to do work they're not just gonna it's a total transformation of software software used to be just hear the rails like we set this up so that you can do this task pretty easily you just go through a workflow over these steps these models are going to do all that work so we are in a total transformation everything has to get rebuilt and redone and it's going to be in the next kind of two year time frame when that needs to happen so if you're looking out and you're like I don't know what to build you are not like you need to get in deep and in some kind of use case and get and start just building stuff and understanding how the technology works so I would I would not recommend like Hey we're gonna go start a business I'd much recommend yeah recommend it yeah build some side projects and launch them and see what happens awesome so would you say find someone who's if you're not necessarily technically capable find someone who is and then and sort of just get deep and start bouncing ideas for each other would be a good place to start yeah and it's probably wouldn't be a bad idea for you even if you're not technical to figure it out okay it's not it's not a two-year thing to build something anymore and if you don't know what the stack is you need to go figure that out first I'm about to post just a basic fine-tuning guide for people to just get chat gbt to help them make a fine-tuning um script and then just put it through get a bunch of example data off kaggle that I grabbed and put it through and did a fine tuning process so I'm trying to educate people on the channel a little bit as well who may be blind um and just be able to I say in the video just that you need to know that at least the starting bit of information yeah how people are doing this and then you're going to be light years ahead of people who are um completely blind and don't know how a lot of the stuff works yeah company any company is gonna need people that understand how it works even at a base level they're you're going to be really really valuable can you discuss any exciting developments or planned for the future for copy AI I expect that the like we're approaching a singularity from a technology standpoint and a singularity means that you suck in everything right everything collapses in into one really tight mass of value the last time we saw this was the phone the iPhone right before the iPhone you had a digital camera you remember those did they have those when you were a kid okay yes yes do you remember the old camcorders right and do you remember do you remember what flashlights look like during a reflection yeah do you remember what what watches look like they'd tell you the time yeah yeah I go okay so what have I want an app watch too so so the hardware ate everything up just ate all of it up like the old Telly you know like all of it it's literally everything is now on a phone same thing's gonna happen in software where everything gets eaten by the model all the interface is the front end The Works the problem's gonna be when you if you're a big tech company and you have a certain business model that's dependent on certain types of activities happening if there's a disruption in the way that activities happen which is what we think then the value of shifts like the value that you can capture and monetize shifts elsewhere and then you gotta you gotta hold new problem on your hands okay well uh one last question um what is your life outside work like uh what are your hobbies how do you stay sane as a as a Founder I've got two kids two two kids yeah I think you're pretty busy they're great yeah I'm you know huge on family married happy awesome that's a great role model for grilling younger viewers grilling I don't know why but every algorithm on my phone is just now showing me like videos of somebody cooking a steak everything it's just constant steak cooking cook on my phone like what are they doing this like can I turn this off and it's like no you have to watch it they're listening to you of course I mean I suppose one last thing any uh general advice for for an aspiring uh entrepreneur like yourself oh yeah you gotta be optimistic one because no pessimists don't do [ __ ] nothing they don't do anything nobody cares and they just depress everybody so I don't want to hear it nobody wants to hear it two if you're not building something today just like go build something real simple and just kind of build and launch in any in the time frame needs to be under a week so anything you're doing needs to be under week and if you can't commit to doing something for a week strength of time frame to like two days and if you can't do that then just like set a timer for like an hour build something and launch it awesome yeah Paul thank you so much for your time I appreciate it I'm insane I'm sure what the viewers do too um everyone watching be sure to go check out copy AI if you haven't already uh excellent tool um say the best writing platform you could possibly find at the moment so much better um and of course head over to uh Twitter and Paulo uh follow Paul I'm going to drop his uh Twitter down below so you can go show some love there and also keep up to date with what he's doing and what copy AI is doing as well so thanks thank you so much Paul uh have an awesome day I don't want to keep you around for too much longer but I appreciate your time and uh all the best [Music]"

              "text": "I spent 14 days trying to build an 80 print on demand business using nothing but AI generated art and this is what happened the rules were simple I had to create a brand new Etsy store I had to pick a specific Niche and I had to create art using only AI art generators I went into this with absolutely zero experience selling on Etsy and only minimal experience using AI art generators after extensively researching Etsy terms of service and copyright law I knew that my Niche was not going to be related to any existing character or brand no matter how abstract my designs were to find my Niche I've spent hours and hours researching on e-rank after carefully balancing Etsy search volume and Etsy competition I eventually decided on three niches that I thought would maximize my chances of success corgis Yosemite and trippy art so I made some art put it on Etsy connected it to printful and this happened just kidding or am I I separated this challenge into three stages stage one art creation to create the insane art that I knew I needed to be successful in this challenge I first studied Advanced methods so that I could get the most out of my journey I spent hours learning every trick in the book and I even found some cheat codes that enabled me to become an AI art generation Wizard and for those of you that stick around in the video I'm actually going to be giving away my exact prompts that I used to create insane art so that you can copy and paste and get started with the Etsy business today what's more I'm actually going to be giving away the exact designs you see in this video to some lucky viewers so they can get started today and get a head start making their own Etsy store more info about this at the end of the video so equipped with these cheat codes I went into mid-journey and started to cook after hours of grinding on my journey and getting better and better at using the tool I eventually had some amazing art that I was really happy with and I couldn't wait to get it on Etsy and start to see those sales rolling for the trippy art that I made I wanted to step up my game even further and get some text put into the images themselves this would make them much better for t-shirt graphics so a hired a graphic designer off upwork for just ten dollars an hour then she sorted it out and put all the text into the images once I had all my designs back from the freelancer I was ready to upscale my images and start listing them on Etsy which brings us to stage two listing on Etsy with my million dollar designs in hand I was ready to conquer the Corgi Yosemite and trippy art niches on Etsy my art was far better than what my competitors were selling so I was very confident going into this that I would have a good launch so I created my Etsy account connected it to printful the print and demand service I was using and began a long and repetitive process of creating all my listings so I headed to bed with most of the listings up excited to see dollar signs of next morning but when I woke up to check our results I was shocked and so we entered stage three making Millis oh another morning and we're back to see our results from the night before nothing not a single view this was a classic back to the joinable moment for me after watching plenty of YouTube videos on the topic and using tools like ever be I had a good idea of exactly what I needed to do to my listings in order to start hitting that front page I decided it was best to double down on my trippy art style I did this for a few reasons firstly I had an advantage making this kind of art because AI art generation engines were just far better than humans at creating this time type of art therefore there was a complete lack of competition of anything on the level that I was creating secondly the Yosemite Niche was mainly sweatshirts with embroidery on it so I couldn't really compete in that area thirdly the Corgi Niche was mainly being run by like cute quotes and memes which I just didn't really have any experience with and it would have taken me a lot longer to get to the point of actually being able to compete with those designs armed with new knowledge around Etsy SEO and with my sights set on dominating the Etsy trippy art scene I went a bit excited to apply what I'd learned and optimize my listings the next day what happened next I never saw coming what's up guys so last night I managed to get up the last of the LSD sort of DMT style pictures and put them on the listings and I wake up this morning to some really really bad news my Etsy store has been suspended this is the email suspended and suspended but I was not giving up yet first I needed to know why I was banned so that you guys can avoid my mistakes according to the email Etsy sent me I'd been banned for listing items as handmade that were not handmade unfortunately this is actually the default setting when you're importing things from printful so for every listing I put up it just automatically selected that it was handmade when you guys are doing this you need to be extremely careful that you're not making the same mistake that I did be 100 transparent with Etsy about how these things are being made next I needed a new strategy on how to get views and sales step one using this genius pricing trick what I learned by digging through all these listings of these top ranking sellers is that these guys are all using one sneaky little pricing trick by pricing just one of your variants way below the rest of them when you appear in search results that lowest price is actually going to be shown on your listing and they were always doing this with the ugliest variant they had so it'll be like the green two shirt with the pink print it's such a genius trick because everyone who sees your listings is going to go oh this is such a cheap price and then come on and then see that all of them apart from the ugliest one that no one wants is actually a much higher price but by that time they're already in your page and viewing your product and you've got a much better chance of closing that sale strategy number two getting to a high customer experience score as fast as possible stores with a high customer experience store on Etsy are automatically rank higher within the search rankings this means you need to be focused on getting these experience scores up as fast as possible and the fastest way to get sales off the bat is to be selling your Goods at break even if you've got a bit of money under you and you're a Chad you could even start selling at a loss just to get these scores coming up by undercutting your competitors you have a higher chance of getting sales and once you have these positive reviews coming in then you have a better chance of ranking higher and you can start increasing those prices so that you're profitable strategy number three is using free shipping listings with free shipping enabled rank much more highly in the Etsy search algorithm what's more customers are much more likely to convert as well so it's a win-win strategy number four titles and keyword optimization all of the top listings that I was competing with in my niches were using tons and tons of different keywords within their titles and descriptions my mistake was just using one you need to be casting a wide net to get the visibility you need so cram those titles and descriptions full of keywords so what are you guys waiting for get started right now I want you all to try this and win so in the description I'm giving away copy and paste file all the best prompts that I found after hours and hours of using my journey what's more I'm actually giving away 10 pieces of art that I made in this video for you guys to use in your own it's as soon as you can there's going to be 10 winners of this draw so if you want to enter head down below like comment subscribe hit the bell and then I'm going to be joining the winners in the next three days I'll be notified the winners by replying to your comment down below as for me I've appealed to Etsy to get my store unbanned so that I can continue this challenge for you guys but in the meantime I want you to take all this information get out there and start trying it for yourself I truly believe that you can make money with this if you take it seriously don't take no for an answer go find the information because it's out there somewhere if you have any ideas or challenges you want me to do hit down below and let me know but that's all for the video my name is Leah

              "text": "my recent video about how to fine-tune gpt3 and build an AI startup in a few minutes got a lot of questions about the Nitty Gritty details on how you can actually do this fine tuning process rather than try to answer you all in the comments I thought I'd pop back on here and make a quick video showing you the step-by-step process of how to go from data to prompting completions to a fine tune model that you can interact with I'm going to be breaking it down a lot more granularly in this video and going A to Z on how any beginner can come in and use data to fine tune it and get a fine-tuned version of gpt3 to use for their own purposes if you're an entrepreneur and are looking to start making money and building businesses in the AI Gold Rush you need to be aware of how these fine-tuning processes work so this video is exactly what you're going to need to learn to get to a basic level of understanding so that you can move forward and start hiring people and know what the process is and be alert and aware of what's going on so we're going to jump back in here where we left off with the NBA players performance data set I'm going to do this all again so we're starting off by downloading the data set links to this will be in the description below fine-tuning these models is one of the biggest opportunities in business of 2023 and I'd say for the next few years because of the power of these models and being able to build on top of them one of the most powerful skills that you can have as an entrepreneur right now is understanding how this process works so that you can start to see opportunities way you can apply data to these models and build a valuable business so don't go anywhere I'm going to be going step by step explaining this whole process and you're not going to want to miss any of it enough talk let's get stuck into it a quick overview of this process from start to finish to start off we need to find a set of data which in this case we're using the NBA players performance started from my previous video then we're going to take that data and create prompt and completion pairs which is the format that we need to provide to gpt3 in order to fine tune it and finally we're going to be able to run a basic app on our computer that is a fine-tuned version of gpt3 that understands the starter that we fit to it to start off we're going to download the NBA player performance data from kaggle the dataset link will be in the description next we're going to import the data to Google Sheets so that we can manipulate it a bit we have an index row here on the left that we can remove now I'm just going to put a filter on this so that we can remove the blanks as I did in the previous video copy this create a new sheet and paste it in now we have it all formatted nicely and Compact and ready to go we're just going to download this data in a CSV format and then open it in Visual Studio code so we can have a look at it now what you need to do is you don't have to visual studio code or your favorite code editor what I'm going to do here it's already opened up but just to help you guys out I'm going to actually close that and then show how you open it so I'm going to go open folder and here is the folder that I've created you need to create a new folder anywhere on your desktop will work and then you need to open that folder by clicking open here and then inside it I've got the I've dragged in the CSV file that we just downloaded and in here's also some of the uh all the data that we download from the kaggle set which we don't really need at the moment because we've got the one that we need which is the scoring then you're going to want to copy the header row and take it over to chat GPT and then we're going to give it just an example row of data so it kind of knows what format works I'll give it a couple actually let's give it four rows of data to have a look at so this is the prompt I'm ready to get started I have a spreadsheet of basketball data these are the column headings in CSV format and I've pasted in the column headings and I've gone here are the rows of data in CSV format and pasted in a few example rows for it to use finally I'm asking it do you understand and I'm hoping after this prompt is sent it's going to say okay I understand what you're trying to do here I've read the CSV and I understand the format of the file great tattoo BT is understood what we've put into it and now we need to ask it for some prompting completion pairs the method I'm going to show you here is actually different to the one I did in my previous video in my last video the way I showed you how to generate these promptly completion pairs using chat GPT is actually not that scalable so I've done a little bit of research and figured out how to get chat GPT to write us a script to generate these pairs and so we can do that with like hundreds of thousands of different pairs so we're going to get stuck into that now I'm telling chat GPT that I want to fine-tune gpt3 using the starter write me a script to create prompted completion pairs within this format and then pasting some examples of the format that I want it back in I'm actually going to insert python in here just to be extra clear okay now after a bunch of missing around and tweaking this just to get it just right so you only have to do it once this is the exact prop that you guys will need to put in I had to really coach it in order to give the right script out the first time so that you guys didn't have to mess around with it so if you're following along head down below to the description I'm going to be pasting these prompts into a Google doc and leaving the share link for you guys to check out down below so if you want to get this entire prompt here that I've had to tweak quite a lot and you can follow along then just kid down below and you can get it off Google doc after submitting that prompt it gave me back the script that I need to get this data into the promptly completion pairs so once you have this code all you need to do is copy it and head back over to vs code right click in here and create a new file and we're going to call it main.pi paste this in save the file and then you're going to want to make sure up here this basketball data.csv is the same name as this so you can just click on here press enter paste it in there and save the file so now we have the name thing all ready to go and then we have it the script all ready to go as well if you're not too familiar with programming and and this basic sort of python scripting I'm going to give you a quick run through of what's Happening Here so that you're not completely blind here we have our CSV data and this is comma separated value so each one of these at the top you have the header and a comma separates it to the next column so this is basically a condensed version of a spreadsheet that a computer can read we have all of the headings up here and they're separated by commas so the computer can read along and say okay this is a column and I've got a uh extension installed on this computer that allows me to see these a lot more easily I'm actually just going to show you that now and here it is it's called rainbow CSV if you just install this quickly then it's going to help you visualize the CSV a lot more easily like I am here so it's pretty straightforward we have the header row and then underneath it is each of the data points for that same as a spreadsheet but it's just not formatted as nicely so by using a method called string interpolation and F strings as you can see here this f means that anything that you put inside of these curly brackets here is going to be uh the value of this player here is index player so this is referencing the player column here right at the end so this player one when you see that key player it's referencing that in the script here so for every row of data that we have coming along here it's going to take this player column which is the green thing here and it's going to say okay I'm gonna because we're on this row and it's going to work down every single row through the whole sheet it's going to take the player value there and write the prompt with it write a summary of player values statistics and then it's going to start building the completion for that row and once again it inserts the player's name and it says player name played games played games starting game started of them so it writes a big long sentence and summary of what the player's data is and every time it comes to one of these blocks here which has got the curly brackets it's reaching into this file and plucking out the right value as the script has made it then all it needs to do is append these prompting completion pairs together into the format that we asked it for back in chat GPT here which is this format and then it just saves it to a Json and dumps it out for us to look at if you're following along I'm assuming you've got python installed on your machine if not head to their website and you can download the latest release of python now that you understand the script let's actually run it and then see what we get the command to run a script and platform is Python and then the name of the script so this case is main.pi and hit enter and then just like that we have a prompt and completion peers.json which looks like a complete mess but it is a ton of data all formatted exactly how we wanted it if you'd like to see it a little bit more pretty what we can do here is type our pritia and this one here if you just install this quickly and then you head back to your uh prompt and completion pairs you can press option shift and if and then it will format it all up nicely like this it looks really good and actually color codes and understand it as Json so you're actually probably going to need to do this so head over grab that extension and come back and press option shift and F now we can see the result of our hard work so now if every player on that spreadsheet that we started with we have the prompt which is write a summary of Luca don't shoot your statistics and in the completion which uses check TPT summary structure and then it's simply done it programmatically and use string installation which is a python feature to pluck data out of that CSV file and put it into the correct place to create this completion I've just taken all of the code out of the main.pi and put it into a new file called generate.pi and saved it so that we can play around in the main.pi file for the next step another fun part of taking all of these pairs and funneling them into gpt3 and fine-tuning it begins to get started you're going to want to head to beta.openai.com and you're going to want to head over to your personal section and view your API key to create an account if you haven't already it's free and then you're going to want to create a new API key here I am just creating a new one now you can see all that on screen but I'm going to delete it you cheeky guys in the in the comments I'm just going to put that there to save it for later now we're on the documentation page for fine tuning bio open AI so we're going to head down to the installation we're going to copy this and head over to our terminal and paste it in I've already got everything downloaded of course so the requirements are already satisfied for me but it should start installing and show a progress bar for you now you need to copy this export string and just bring it back over to your main.pi file to copy this entire API key and then paste it within these quotations now we need to copy this entire thing hit back and paste this in and this means that it's worked we've exported the open AI key so now it's ready to use for later next we're going to have to prepare our data so you can copy this head over to your terminal and delete all this and this local file means we need to reference our content completion file and what we can do is come over here copy all of this head back paste it in there and hit enter I've just taught it to prepare my data and it says here your file appears to be in Json will be converted to Json L which is the format it needs your file contains 250 prompted completion pairs which is a pretty good starting little batch of data we have here now it gives you me a whole bunch of tips and tricks on how it can make the data better and get better results out of it so you probably want to have a read through this whenever you do this again and uh follow all of the instructions here because it's going to make your model a whole lot better for all of these pairs we should really have a suffix on it that is really unique and like a bunch of slashes and hashtags and stuff too there's a few things here like starting all of your completions with the white space character using a unique ending like pound signs on the end of your completions all of these are really important to do we don't have time in the scope of this video if you'd like a little bit more on that I can shoot a quick loom for you guys and put it in the in the comment section below but for all purposes of this video we're good to go and we can hit in on this and it's going to convert it from Json into Json l and again add a white space character to the beginning of the completion it's going to do it for us which is great and yes and just like that we have it all made up into Json L format ready to put into the fine tuning process now we can actually fine tune our model uh you need to head over here and copy this and note that you can change the name of the base model that you're starting from so I've got this put in here open AI fine tunes.create I've put Curie at the end to specify the model that we want to use and now I also need to put in the path to the file which is all the data that it's going to use to fine-tune so I've got to go over here copy this entire thing including the suffix and then paste this in here and then hit enter so what this is now going to do is upload all of that data and put you in the queue to fine tune and then it's going to put all that data through their fine tuning method and then the result is going to be a fine-tuned version of gpk3 that is familiar with all of this basketball information and in just a few minutes we've got our fine tune model complete and here down on the bottom of the screen you can see what the name of the model is called you're going to want to copy that and save it for later now we need to head back to chat gbt so that we can get a graphical user interface or GUI so that we can interact with this now to make things super easy I'm actually just going to grab the GUI script from the previous video that I did so I'm going to copy this this is going to be available in the Google talk down in the description so head over there and grab that this is going to have all this code that you need in order to run a basic GUI so that you can interact with your fine tune model and we're going to head back and here we have the name of our model that we want to cut that out of there and replace it within these uh quotations here now before you try to start this app up make sure you save your main.pi file before you start running it python main.pi function ran and just like that we have a fine tune gpt3 window up and we can start giving it prompts if I paste in one of these prompt here Jason Tatum statistics and paste them in it's going to give me out what is the beginning of this completion now it seems to be having an issue where it's not writing out the entire completion I'm not sure if that's an issue with my API key or a limit on the API request or it's an issue within the GUI itself but I'm going to have a dig into that over the next couple hours and get back to you guys in a bit hey guys I just took a little look into why it's not completing the rest of it and turns out it's a pretty simple fix in the completion line here openai.completion.create there's actually a parameter that is a Max tokens that is usually set so 10 or something just so that it limits how much you're charged through the API so it's a built-in safety feature to stop you spending too much money all you need to do is come in and change us here by adding in this comma Max tokens equals I've done 150 and that about that's about right for what we need so if I just run the Python program again here bring it over another thing you need to note as well is that in the preparing process I didn't notice it at the time but what it did is trim out the writer summary part so as you can see here it says write a summary of look Advantage statistics but what it did is because it was shared with all of the different prompts it actually cut it out in the preparation process so all our prompts are really is just their name and their statistics afterwards so if I take that over to our app here and put it in load for a bit now I've actually retrained this on a DaVinci model off camera just because DaVinci is actually a lot better for recognizing what text you want so if you train with Curie make sure you go back and retrain with DaVinci it cost me about three bucks in order to get it retrained but definitely worth it and as you can see here we've got the entire prompt here which we expected and it's actually started giving us information on Karl Anthony towns and statistics so I'm not 100 sure why it's continuing down the list there but we got our result we got our entire print out of janus's Statistics so I've been a result the last episode thanks for sticking around and we'll get back to the video for the purpose of this video I've shown you how to go from start to finish how you can take your data you can prepare that data you can get it put into a promptly completion Pairs and then finally fine-tuned your version of gpt3 so that you can start interacting with it of course this is an extremely basic example and the understanding that this gpt3 fine-tuned model has of this basketball topic is very limited and you need to give it uh probably thousands and thousands more variations of these prompts once you've given it enough data its understanding will be flexible of the topic and you'd actually be able to ask us basically any question and start being sort of specific about it and saying hey what are the three players playing for the XYZ team who have the highest field goal percentage and that's the kind of stuff that you'd eventually be able to get to given enough training data so that's all for the video guys I've shown you how to go from start to finish and fine tuning a model with a bit of data so if you have any questions about this or you've got stuck or something's not working on your computer Drop it Down Below in the comments either I'll help you or someone else in the community will the important thing about learning this process is that as an entrepreneur you need to understand that this is what is going on behind the scenes for a lot of the startups that you're seeing just spending half an hour or an hour trying to understand this process is going to put you leagues ahead of other entrepreneurs and other people trying to make money in this AR gold rush because you understand the underlying buying technicalities of how these models are being created and fine-tuned but the understanding of this process you are going to be keeping a close eye out for data sources and understanding how you can get that data source and integrate it into a gpt3 model or a gpt4 model which is coming up very soon so I hope you got something out of this remember that down in the description I'm going to have a Google doc having all of the prompts that I sent to church EBT and also the code so it should be pretty straightforward for you guys to have a play around with us I really hope you enjoyed and got

              "text": "I lost my first client due to the influence of AI tools last week the rapid rise of AI tools like chat GPT are changing the landscape of smma for good over the past five years smma has been one of the most popular online business models for entrepreneurs to get started with low Capital pushed by large influencers like high low beers and among Ghazi this business model has garnered enormous amounts of attention and has served as the backbone for the success of many entrepreneurs today as an agency owner myself and having lost a client just last week to these influences I've had to do a real deep dive and closely look at the dangers and threats to this business model but with every crisis comes great opportunities for smart entrepreneurs if you're an agency owner like me and you're concerned about how these AI tools are going to affect your business and whether you're going to be losing clients soon you're going to want to stick around because I'm going deep on how each of your different services are being affected by Ai and then explaining to you three ways as an agency owner that you can start to change your business right now so that you're on the front foot and you're ready to make the most of all of these changes going on and make the most money in these next few years so let's get stuck into it first service is going to be shaken up is obviously copywriting I'm sure you're aware by now of all the different copywriting tools using AI that are available to you you've got copy AI you can use chat GPT and you can use stuff like Jasper as well these tools are going to massively reduce the amount of money you need to spend on copywriting for your clients each month one really good copywriter that's trained to use these tools and can get the most out of them and then also tweak it afterwards there's going to be a huge asset to you rather than having to pay three or four different copywriters at once blog posting and SEO work of course has already been shaken up a ton by writing tools like chat GPT what you used to have to get content writers to do and take them hours you can now get done in a few seconds with chat GPT so in the same way as copywriting hiring people who are more efficient at getting these articles out by using these tools but then also adding a little bit of a human element to shake them up and be distinguishable from the AI written ones that are all over the Internet already thirdly ideas for your creatives and scripting for the creatives too the resource and time intensive process of coming up with ideas for creatives to put on social platforms is being made a ton Easier by these tools like jgbt first you can ask it to give you ideas to using creatives secondly it can write the script for these creatives in just a few as well this is going to drastically reduce the amount of time and energy you're having to put in to get creative work done having someone who knows how to use these tools and get the most out of them to create these creative ideas and get the scripts written is going to be a huge asset to any agency only moving forward leading off from that point number four is Media creation itself AI tools are already extremely good at creating video audio and images from basically nothing in seconds for video you have tools like Pick 3 that are going to connect stock footage to your scripting and automatically make a video for you and save you a ton of time for audio you can get AI created music now and for images you can use things like Dali or stable diffusion or mid-journey to create some awesome images for basically zero cost fifth is email marketing and email Design This ties back into the copywriting so you can get all your copywritten for your emails and basically a fraction of the time but an important thing to note is that you can also get email design done by things like chat GPT by asking it okay can you make me an email that looks like this and then you can paste in the content that you want in the email or you could even ask it for the email flow structure itself write the email and give you the HTML CSS code that you need to create that email and finally number six is strategy through tools like chat gbt you now have a strategy advisor you can tell chat GPT as much information as you can about the situation your client is in or what results they're looking to get what are the key benefits of the product and it can give you back strategic recommendations on what you should be doing now of course there's a pretty high chance that these will be rubbish but if you do find some gems in there it's still definitely worth giving it a go I know what you're thinking but that's every single part of my business and yes those points have just covered makeup 95 of all agencies so knowing all this how can you as an agency owner lean into these Trends to make your business better off in this uncertain future I know it seems like there's a lot changing right now but there is a silver lining to it this is an enormous reshuffling of the smma world the best part is is that it's giving smaller providers a chance to use their increased agility to take advantage of these tools and of these Trends before the big players get ahead these are my three points for agency owners looking to scale aggressively into this air Revolution to come out better than you were before firstly you need to be leveraging these AI tools for every cent they're worth you have the chance now to drastically reduce the cost of many of the services that you provide instead of having three copywriters who are mediocre on payroll you can now have one who's amazing and he only has to work for a few hours a week if this expert copywriter is trained how to use these tools correctly and then add his Flair and add his personal touch to make this copy really pop then you have an excellent combination on your hands imagine if all the copy that you gave to your clients had the touch of an expert on it you need to be training Kim members of your team to know how to use these tools so that they can get the most out of them and be more efficient workers using interplan entire new email flows in seconds and get them written and designed on the spot there are so many opportunities for you to tighten the bolts on your business and cut off any fat that doesn't need to be there anymore this is the first and I would say now mandatory step for agency owners moving forward if you fail to lean down using these tools you're probably going to get undercut sooner or later secondly you need to be looking to expand your service offering to add additional services using these tools for example you could be using AI image generation tools to assist in web design so that you can begin to offer web design as a service to your clients instead of having to hire an expensive and full-time web designer you can get someone who knows how to use these image iteration tools and then pass over those web designs to someone who's a cheaper freelancer who knows how to do it but doesn't necessarily have the Creative Flair to get it done to an excellent standard in this way the AI does with the hard work of getting a really good themed website and all you need to do is pass it over to someone who knows how to do graphic design and they can square it up into a website to pass into your client I'm actually thinking of doing a video on web design using AI tools so if you'd like to hear more about that and how I'm planning to implement it in my agency let me know down below another example will be offering to add Customer Support Services to your stack using AI tools like chat CPT who are already amazing at writing and understanding written text to user and customer support is just a no-brainer I'm actually in the beginning phases of my own AI Power customer support startup at the moment I've already gone to my clients and offered them these services and they're all extremely interested because I can do it at an extremely cheap rate so I can't wait to tell you guys more about that in the future another awesome service that you can add to your stack is actually artificial intelligence Consulting as a bit of an AI nut myself I've actually already been helping my clients to do an audit of their brand to do order of their business and using my AI knowledge I've been able to tell them where and point out the areas that they could improve on their business and cut some fat off and do all the same things that I'm essentially doing with my agency but do it in their brand or do it in their business if you're interested in this kind of AI Consulting work that I'm doing and you'd like to know more about how I'm actually fulfilling these services please let me know down below and I'd happily do a video on it to help you guys add that to your stack as well the third and final thing that agency owners need to be doing in order to succeed and scale into this air Revolution is to look to be the the first person into the new industries that develop now this is the biggest opportunity because this is your chance to use your agility to get them first before the big agencies and establish yourself in these new potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Industry that is going to be developed over the next few years the most obvious example of this in my eyes is that search is changing tools like chat GPT are completely revolutionizing the way search is done while the SEO side of your business may be getting hurt by these tools there's a huge opportunity coming up on the horizon right now which is SEO for these chat models if chat gbt like tools do end up fully replacing search and now we're only interacting with this chat box and getting just one answer there's going to be an enormous Island race amongst every business in the world as to how they can get their name in that box when customers that they want to get in front of ask questions about their products it's keeping your eyes open for opportunities like this that are gonna open entirely new industries that you can move into and make the money first that is going to put yourself on the front foot to make the most money out of this AI Revolution I'm thinking of covering the Search revolution in a future video so if you want that please let me know down below so are we witnessing the death of smma right in front of our eyes the answer of course is no smma will not die but it is going to rapidly change due to the influence of these AI tools you need to be looking at this as the enormous opportunity that it is rather than a threat as I said earlier this is an enormous shake-up and reshuffling of the smma world smart entrepreneurs like you can win in this Revolution by firstly improving and optimizing your services by offering a range of entirely new services to your clients and being agile enough to jump on these new Industries as they appear so that's all for the video let me know your thoughts down below and if you have any tips or tricks or thoughts to share with the other agency owners please

              "text": "in this video I'm going to be showing you seven artificial intelligence tools that you can be using in 2023 as an entrepreneur to get ahead of the pack and supercharge your productivity me and my team have gone deep to find you guys some tools that we haven't really seen being talked about much that are really going to help you be more productive in your everyday life the tools I'm going to cover in this video are the kind of tweaks that you can make to your schedule and your workflow this year to become more productive and really hit the ground running and beat the competition in every aspect you can so to those who stick around to the end I know that you're going to be the ones to crush this year thank you so much for watching unless you're stuck into it but before we get started my name is Liam Motley I'm a self-made serial entrepreneur from New Zealand and now living in Dubai finally back here after a few weeks away on this channel I create content for aspiring and established entrepreneurs looking to hit it big and strike rich in this AR Gold Rush happening right now I post at least three videos every single week on this topic so if you're an entrepreneur looking to get hit make some money in this huge opportunity we have in front of us make sure you hit down below subscribe to the channel hit the Bell so you're notified when I drop my next video and leave a like if you feel it really really helps my video reach more people thank you so much tool number one compose AI compose AI is a free Chrome plugin that's going to help you write faster in your emails on face Facebook wherever it is and slack we're giving you AI generated suggestions and autocomplete here we are on the compose AI site I can just scroll down and show you what the features are autocomplete is going to like you into Gmail it's going to give you order completion suggestions it's going to enable you to rephrase sentences which is a really cool functionality just like in chat GPT you can ask it to shuffle things around and make it different and then this easy reply compose now all sorts of different features that I'm going to show you in a sec super easy install we're just going to head to the Chrome web store right now add to Chrome and then boom installed just like that they've got a nice tutorial here if you'll never watch but I've actually got it all sorted out so to get started with it I'm just hearing my Gmail what you can do is I click down at the bottom and say open compose now so in here I can ask a light chat GPT it's going to know what I'm asking for and it's going to write it out for me so in this I can write ask Graham if you can buy me a new dog for Christmas and mention that I'll be home on the 12th of August and just like that it's giving me a full email written out I've only had to write one short sentence and then it's given me an entire email all I could say is cheers Liam and then I'm done and there are also order complete features so if I'm like I am not sure what you mean so as you can see as I write along it gives me order for complete suggestions it's really quick really Snappy and I think if you're an entrepreneur who's running a lot of emails who doesn't have time or you haven't can't quite afford an assistant then something like this is such a great tool because you can just write into that prompt or everything you need for the email hit enter and it's going to give you a fully populated email you can just fire that off this is going to save so much messing around I for one is definitely going to be adopting this in my email flow one last great feature about composer.ai is this rephrase option so I've selected it and then I can click rephrase it actually has a couple here shorten expand formal tone or for any touch there's some great examples here of things you can do I'm going to rephrase it and there you go I've got a rephrased example of what I just had so we're going to take this and I'm going to put a friendly and shorten it down give an unfriendly tone when you're writing emails you get all different blocks that you work with you can get it to write stuff for you you can shorten it lengthen it for any tone business own all sorts of great things that are going to be handy for you when you're writing your emails every single day tool number two is the script the script is an insanely powerful video editing software that's online that's powered by artificial intelligence here we are at the scripts website it gives you a few examples of what you can do with a video editing screen recording podcasting and transcription now this doesn't even give you a hint of just how powerful some of these tools are that they have got included in their app I'm actually thinking of getting my YouTube Editor to start using this because I honestly will save them so much time and save me a few hours in Billing as well so really check this out it's a great explainer video on their website right here which will save me a ton of breath but it's got some crazy features like the transcription is going to be able to take all the audio from your video transcribe it all and have it in sort of a text conversation based way where you can look at it like a text document and then edit what you're saying and it will learn using artificial intelligence learn your voice I'm pretty script Ure download a description in the app now I'm in the demo project so I'm going to show you a few of the features of it the main feature of the script is the side panel here which is going to allow you to basically connect the text and the video to the different bits of video that are being shown so the script knows what words are being saying when in your video which allows you to modify how it's being said and modify the words within the actual video itself so they have an insane feature called overdubbing overdubbing allows you in this text editor here to change what they said so here if I head to the overdub editor and I select that all it asks me to assign a voice so if I sign a voice it's Tiff here which is the person in the video what I want to do is create a new voice for it to be able to replicate your voice and your videos and allow you to edit and overdub things you need to give it 10 minutes of training data so in this project you won't let me show you but if you have a say half an hour video or the more the better I assume if I have like half an hour an hour of me talking on a podcast I can give that to the script and it's going to learn my voice and then if I say something in the podcast I don't like I can head to this text editor on the side and I can change what I wrote by overdubbing it not only does the script have this insane side panel here that switches up the flow of editing completely and makes it so much more into it would have end up text base also has tons of stock footage that you can search through and give you a great range of things to choose from and use in your videos it has all the usual text editing things and effects and animations to make them look cool and slide in and stuff and best of all it is shareable it's like figma you can add teammates in here and they can work on the project with you actively so I'm for sure going to be asking my editors to check this out and see if we can start working on here in future so that I can see the projects and the project files aren't all scattered around the globe tool number three browse AI browse AI has done a great job of turning the headache of web scraping and monitoring different web pages into a streamlined system all on their website that just makes it such a breeze to use if you're not familiar with web scraping it's a process of scraping data off different web pages and usually it's a bit of a headache because you've actually got to dig through all of the code of that webpage and pluck out the different elements these guys have done a great job of making it this nice intuitive way of web scraping so here we are on browser ai's website it's going to show you what they can do data extraction monitoring and pre-built robot setup so there's a whole bunch of functionality these guys give no coding required two minute sit-ups so it starts off here are we looking to extract structured data or we're looking to monitor site changes monitor site changes obviously pretty straightforward extract structure data we're going to do one of these as an example so here I've just taken a y combinator site and I can head back over and put it in here start recording task install the extension so now we have it here in the corner and it's going to actually record what I'm doing so browser AR is a scraping tool that's going to allow you set up monitors and different sites you want to be looking at for example you could be scraping a competitor's site and keeping an eye on what new products they put out so here I've selected the table of data that I want to start scraping once I've selected all the things I want to scrape and I hit enter to finish so it's a simple use case for this would be looking at Facebook groups and you want to scrape all the data off the Facebook group and store it in the list you can actually connect this to your Google Sheets so you'll be able to scrape all the data off any website you want to find without having to hire a developer which is usually what you'd have to do with web scraping if you're looking at scraping some data off the web in a systematic way this is like 20 30 a month great tool number four is tone Tome is an artificial intelligence presentation Builder that's going to save you so much time it will create you some fire presentations and just a click of a button so we're going to jump in and have a look as an entrepreneur you might be putting together a pitch deck for some fundraising so we can hop into this one one of the cool things here is Dali is going to allow me to put things into a prompt and then get instant AI generated images to put into my presentation and here I've put in a prompt skyscraper rising up from the payment in New York viewed from the ground there we go just like that we put an image from Valley put into our presentation now look you can drag these around it's really intuitive the way it shuffled things through there's a bunch of easy theme settings you can change it's going to save you a ton of time so you don't have to go through every single slide and change the font click this and it's going to change all of the headline fonts for you and then you can change the paragraph once just as easily so this is kind of stuff to save you so much time coming through changing your font changing your color scheme adding in those AI images this is the exact kind of software that I'm going to be using when I'm making my presentations this year it's just so intuitive Gonna Save Me So Much Time The Styling here is just off the charts and you're going to be able to pull in artificially generated images I mean just look at some of these tables that it's got it looks so fantastic compared to what you'd be able to do on any other presentation maker like PowerPoint so if this year if you've got any really important presentations that you need to drop and you need to save time and then make a splash with how good they look a tool like Tome is going to be excellent for you in that regard tool number five is Synthesia Synthesia allows you to use AI avatars and tell them what to say the only website here you can see this is a great example this guy looks more natural on camera than most YouTubers they have a ton of different actors that you can use and I also have a ton of different languages as well so this is just got everything you need in terms of making a human looking person that speaks whatever you want now you may be asking why do I need this well if you haven't noticed because of tools like chat GPT faceless YouTube automation has become a serious player in the online business space people are making thousands and thousands of dollars a month by making YouTube videos with scripts written by Ai and then putting it into tools like Pick 3 and making artificially generated stock footage that goes on top of the captions and they're posting on YouTube this kind of tool is what you can use in creating your YouTube automation videos that's going to allow you to keep your face off it and put someone up there instead not only is it going to make your content creation schedule faster because doing this like I'm in front of a camera takes hours but you can just type it on it's going to give you all at once but number two you never have to get your face in it anyway so here we're going to create a quick AR video you can tell her what to say Liam has such fire tools to use an entrepreneur in 2023 let's run this up Kim has such fire tools to use as entrepreneurs in 2023 let's run this up using faceless YouTube Automation and combining with tools like this you can start making a ton of money on YouTube as a Creator but never put your face on what's more you could start making these explainer and training videos for companies if you can come to companies and say hey I'll make you some great training videos that are super high quality got a great presentation behind it and then you can use tools like this to create these Bots that speak your script for you you can start creating a ton of money by selling to these corporate companies on excellent training videos that you can make for a fraction of the price of others being able to undercut media companies that require cameraman and actors and lighting and stuff by using these tools is such a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs right now who want to get in ahead of these guys and start making money and stealing their business away tool number six is flyfin flyfin is your accountant powered by artificial intelligence it uses artificial intelligence to find all of the deductions and loopholes that you can possibly get to squeeze the most money out of your income and get the least amount possible to the government here on the site you can see it's the number one AI tax engine for Freelancers AI best product of the year so to use flyfan all you need to do is sign up and link your accounts in the artificial intelligence is going to find every possible tax deduction for you to use a New York filing so you can save as much money as possible it's going to be looking through all of these things and find the deductions that you can save money on and then it's going to ask you to approve them or decline them or send them off to a CPA to have a look at more closely so as a solo entrepreneur for many years myself these kind of tools would have been a lifesaver and save me a ton of money on my my account on bills but I know it can be a massive headache if you're starting online businesses right now if you've been running one for a few months or a few years when it comes down to tax time I know it can be very daunting so something like this for an entrepreneur going into 2023 is going to give you one piece of mind but two save you a bunch of time and three save you a ton of money through these deductions I think this is such an excellent tool I wish I had this when I was getting my start when I didn't have to pay all that money to my accountant here we have a demo on screen it's taking my credit card checking account savings obviously not real data but that's an example now it's analyzing all of my expenses it's finding the deductions based on my tax profile and millions of other rules the ahi's found deductions worth 8 678 now if I connect to my account and I saw that I could save ten thousand dollars on my tax bill for the year that would be an excellent excellent little head of those meme for me there you have a quick run through of the app I think this is an excellent tool I'm assuming this is only available for us customers so if your us viewer definitely take advantage of this if you live outside the US like I have my whole life then I'm sure are used to the feeling of not being able to have fun with a lot of these Financial tools that people create our seventh and final tool is Excel formula bot Excel formula bot is like chat GPT but it's going to help you create all the Excel formulas that you need if you're an entrepreneur and have me for a while I'm sure you're familiar with the nightmare you can have a Google sheet and Excel over time something like this is such an incredible tool because it's going to use that AI sort of conversational style dialogue that you have which at gbt but it's going to help you get formulas for your Excel spreadsheets transform your text instructions into Excel formulas in seconds with the help of AI for free as you can see on the side here you can either give it a prompt and ask for a formula for it or you can take a formula and get an explanation for it so this is just an excellent tool we're going to jump straight in and give you an example of how I'd be using it in my own businesses right now using an example for my YouTube financials report as you can see on screen here this is super powerful it can take the easiest to the hardest XL formulas that you can give it based on Tech so look from this average column of a and then all of this it can convert it into a complex if and statement with regix matching and a whole bunch of other stuff this can definitely handle anything you throw at it here's an example of a drive future Financial spreadsheet that I'm looking at right now I've got a video editor name I've got the editing hours over thumbnail designer and have the thumbnail hours what I want to do is create a function in this total cost column that's going to look at who the editor is and then use a rule if the editor is X then multiply the hours by y so if I have editors that are on different rates then I can quickly multiply across the row and do the same with the thumbnail designer and then for every single time a new video is made a new editor or a thumbnail editor does it it will automatically calculate it based on who the people are and what their rates are so I've hit it over here and I've inputted it into the tool and I've got Google Sheets and I want to generate it not explain so you can have a look at this basically I've been very specific about the columns and rows what it's going to be and what I expect the multiplication to be and then I said at the end add the result of both these and output it to column G row two so you need to make sure you're putting in the rows so that when you expand it down and copy that same down across all the columns it's going to automatically adjust the ones it needs to adjust you need to be specific about it just to get for one row so I've put in the row and the column here then if I take this copy it and put it into the total cost hit enter Then it gives me the 255 and I can drag it down it's going to automatically apply it to the next column and adjust the rows this will just save me a ton of time I was thinking I was gonna have to go on Fiverr and find someone to do this for me but just like that now to give me a really complex if structure function that I can put into the cells here and it work out exactly how much I'm paying my editors and how much I'm paying my YouTube thumbnail creators this is an excellent tool and I'm definitely going to be using this a ton it's going to save me a ton of time looking for people to do this and a ton of money as well because I'm not having to pay people to do it congratulations for making it to the end and I hope you're going to be applying some of these to your life because I certainly will be you need to go out there with the best tools the best weapons to crush the competition and some of these are going to save you the time and the money needed to get to the top of the pyramid so if you've enjoyed the video and got something out of it I made content like this every day for people who are looking to get an edge as an entrepreneur I just did an AI startup in just eight minutes using chat gpta I told it to ride a little for me so I'm going to put it up in the corner here somewhere so that you can watch that it's

five of these business models showing you exactly how you can get started and how I would do it if I was in your position I'm going to be saving my favorite two business models for lasso whatever you do don't go anywhere you're going to want to stick around and watch all of them I'm going through them step by step and you're really going to want to stick around for those last two I really can't wait to show you guys that but before we get started my name is Liam Motley I'm a self-made serial entrepreneur from New Zealand now living in Dubai on this channel I create content for aspiring and established entrepreneurs looking ahead at big and make valuable business in the AI Gold Rush that we're seeing right in front of us I post at least three videos a week on these topics so if you don't want to miss out please hit down subscribe to the channel hit the Bell if you don't want to miss the next one leave a like and if you have any questions that come up during the video please drop them in the comments and I'll be replying to you all as soon as I can business model number one creating Niche shows on Etsy using AI art and using print on demand to fulfill it premise of this business model is creating Niche stores on Etsy around specific topics that people are really interested about your job in this business model is to create awesome art on mid-journey which is an AI art generation tool and then put it on some T-shirts put it on some posters put it on your Niche store in Etsy and then use print-on-demand services that I'm going to talk about later to actually ship and create those products so to get started you first need to find a niche one good keyword research tool for Etsy is called e-rank there'll be links for all of these things down in the description so hit down there if you want to click through to it to find our Niche we're going to search something basic like sure then you need to sort by lowest competition now we're going to find these low competition keywords on Etsy but we also want to pair that up with some really high Google searches for example here we have a Rick and Morty shirt with 805 competition in the USA and 8 100 Google searches those are some pretty good numbers so we're gonna go with that what you're then going to need to do is head over to Mid Junior's website and join their Discord mid-journey's AI art generation platform is actually run through the Discord server so all you need to do is head into the Discord server and use the prompts provided to start creating your own air what we're going to do is slash imagine so here is a prompt that I've just made up Rick and Morty fighting off aliens hyper realistic plasma let's see what this gives us here we have our first sample of air generated art for this Rick and Morty keyword because I like this one I'm going to hit V2 which will give me variations of that one so on screen you've got U1 to 4 and V1 to four you was going to upscale that image and V is going to give you multiple different versions that are similar to it so I like this one in the corner so I'm going to go V2 and get some variations of that now we have four different variations of that one bit of art I really like the top left one so I'm going to upscale it and get a full size image out of it now and here we have our upscaled image that is ready to be saved now that you've got a good bit of art from my journey that you think the people in your Niche will like you now need to create an Etsy account and then connect that Etsy account to a print-on-demand service I'm not going to bore you with the details of creating an Etsy account I'm sure you can figure that out but once you have the Etsy account made you also need to go I need to create an account on printful printful is an awesome printer demand service it's going to allow you to put images on mugs and posters and t-shirts and a whole bunch of other stuff if you want to sign up for printful hit down below I've got my affiliate link down there if you want to help the channel out then please do so printful as an integration that will allow you to directly connect to your Etsy store it's a pretty basic documentation it's all here on screen you'll be able to find this and just follow this step-by-step thing to get yours integrated I'm not going to show you all here we haven't got time in this video pretty straightforward and then once you go back to printful you can start creating your different items and once you've created them to your liking then you can put them on your Etsy store and start selling the reason why I think this is such a profitable and scalable business model is because Etsy brings all the traffic in you are not having to Market any of your stuff all you need to do is be hitting these right keywords and then your stuff will be marketed to the right people who are searching for that kind of merch I'm actually thinking of doing a case study on this exact method so if you guys want to see me run this and do it for a week or so and show you my results then please head down to the comment section let me know and I'll for sure make that video for you guys if you really want it business model number two YouTube book summaries your job then is to find the books if people want to be reading about and then create that summary for them on YouTube using AI tools so to start off we're going to hit to Amazon and start looking for some books I found a book Rich there Poor Dad what you need to do is head over to this tubebuddy extension Rich Dad brought out Robert Kiyosaki summary and how we get a very good score which has got good score good search volume and a bunch of other things but basically this tells you that's a good keyword to be optimizing for what you're now going to do is come over to chat gbt and ask for a summary of the book so I've asked it for a summary I've asked for a breakdown of the key point and then I've asked it to merge it together so we get a nice full explanation of the book and its key points and a format that we can then pass over to our next step next we're going to take that summary over to an amazing AI tool called Pick 3 all you need to do is paste that script then and then it's going to match videos to those bits of text and it's going to make a seamless video just like that that we can begin to use on our YouTube channel pick a style and aspect ratio 16x9 for YouTube if you want to sign up to pick 3 hit down below it's in the description and just like that Pick 3 is matched up video to the different parts of text in the script and we have an excellent video ready to go that you would need to do a little bit of tweaking like this first slide here all you need to do is export this post it on your new channel and just start doing this over and over again find more books that are in high demand using that keyword research tool tubebuddy make these summaries and post them and soon enough you're gonna have some hits and you're going to start getting views and monetized and making money just as an example here's an 11 million view video doing a summary of atomic habits so there's definitely a lot of demand for these Services business model number three Tick Tock traffic to free ebook to ClickBank offer posting videos on Tick Tock and certain niches and trying to build up a following is such a great way to get traffic to your offers this business model is all about picking a specific Niche on Tick Tock posting content for it eventually building up some views and then funneling all that attention and all those eyeballs through to a free ebook that you offer in your link in your link tree and your bio on Tech talk the ebook is going to be within the niche that you're doing your videos from and then it's going to contain specific links from ClickBank and you're going to be able to earn as affiliate tips for selling these ClickBank offers to get started with this business model you need to choose a niche and then once you have your Niche you can start looking for offers on ClickBank for the purpose of this video I'm going to be doing a motivation uh theme page on Tech talk and that's pretty easy to create content for but then also on ClickBank it's easy to find self-help type offers that I can sell within my ebook so I found a ClickBank offer called wealth manifestation offer taking the market by storm we get 47 per conversion on this it's got a great gravity store now we need to figure out what's the topic of our free ebook and for that we're going to go back and use chat GPT so I've asked chat GPT I have a motivation theme page on Tick Tock I also have a wealth manifestation offered from ClickBank that I want to sell through a free ebook what are some ebook ideas that I could sell this offering and there it goes it's given me a whole bunch of great options so now I just need to choose one of them and get it to write the entire book for me so I've picked one of them I'm asking for an outline you know the driller here you ask for an outline you put in a document then you ask for the different parts of that outline to be written out in full designer is an awesome tool that's going to allow you to convert that text that charity petition has given you for that into a really awesome looking ebook that looks super professional and it's going to trick all the people on The Tick Tock that this is the legit stuff not made by AI completely so while you can try to format it in word and other tools and then use canva to make a front cover for it this is going to save you so much time and it's going to look a whole lot better so if you want to use this there's a link down in the description as well so you can sign up for that once you have the ebook made you're going to need to go through it and figure out where you can put buttons into a link to that offer on ClickBank so you can start earning commission all you need to do now is set up a link Tree in your Tech talk bio and then start posting content within that motivation Niche or whichever Niche you're doing this can be repurposing content from other people can be editing it slightly or it can be using Pick 3 which is another great tool we've seen today and go to chat sheet between ask for what are some motivational video ideas for my Tick Tock account in the motivation Niche it'll give you some ideas and then you can take that script and then put it into Pick 3 and we'll match it up with cool guys working out and motivation stuff in the background so get creative with how you can make this Tech talk content then you can start getting more eyeballs to your offer and start making money and then you can expand Beyond just the motivation Niche and start doing a bunch of other niches as well I really love this business model and I hope some of you guys get some great results using it into the final two business models now thank you for sticking around we've still got more to come business model number four is YouTube automation using Amazon affiliate links so what you you're going to be doing is finding High ticket items on Amazon in certain categories that have higher commissions so that you can earn as much money as possible pretty straightforward business model what you're going to be doing is finding High ticket products on Amazon with a good referral commission then you're going to get chat GPT to write your scripts for YouTube videos and you're going to create these with pick three so let's get started here we have some fees for the Amazon affiliate program for example because kitchen appliances here have a nine percent commission rate we're going to take that over to chat CPT and ask some examples of kitchen appliances on Amazon that are over 200 so I've just asked it for some kitchen appliance on Amazon that are over 200 so it's given me a bunch of different products I'm going to take one of these and ask for a script to be written for the YouTube video we're going to make now I've taken that name of the product and I've asked Give me a summary of the Ninja foodie 911 pressure cooker including its best features and who it will be good for so hopefully the summary that it gives us gives us enough information that we can start making a YouTube video out of this now you're going to take that script and head back over to pick 3 and rinse and repeat the process paste to your text in and proceed and just like that Pick 3 is matched up the text to a bunch of great videos what I would probably do is get a few stock footage things of this actual product I go into Amazon to see if there's any videos I can find of it or I go to YouTube and see if there's any uh footage of it being used and just plop it in here and then maybe in the in the first one and a couple through the video just so it doesn't look too stock footage now all you need to do is create your YouTube channel your little niche kitchen review product uh Channel and start posting videos like this find more products create more videos and post them on your channel now in the description of every single one of these videos needs to be your affiliate link to this product so you can get paid on every single sale I'm not going to bore you with signing up to the Amazon affiliate program but I'm sure you can figure that out head on to Amazon site ask to join the affiliate program and then you're going to be able to get your own unique links from their website and put it into the descriptions of your videos and finally business model number five is YouTube translation services translates and services for YouTube creators are booming because of headlines like this 60 of YouTube views come from a non-english speaking audience with this business model you're going to be finding clients who need the YouTube videos uh translated and put different subtitles on so they can reach wider audiences this is such a valuable business because you're helping them Reach more people with the same content repurposing it is going to be such a no-brainer for them especially if you can keep that price point Low by using AI tools by helping them tap into a much broader market and allowing them to get their content in front of more people they're going to be making more money and are willing to share some of that with you your job as a business owner is to take videos from a content creator and put a different language subtitle on it to do this we're going to be using a tool called Nova AI link will be in the description if you want to head over and check it out such an amazing tool it's a really good video editing platform online editing platform in its own right so to start with Nova AIS put a set of subtitles on my video in English you can change the language of the subtitles so this is going to listen to the entire video's audio transcribe it and then put those into well-timed subtitles but the translate feature is even better all I need to do I've got Danish here on the screen and English all I need to do is click the eyeball on the Danish one and then all of a sudden it's got Danish subtitles and just one click you have changed it from English to Danish subtitles and they're all synced up perfectly that's about it for this business model if I was to do this as a business model I'd probably go and upwork and find someone to do quality control for me just to make sure the videos and the subtitles I'm giving to my clients is actually correct but you just need to get someone to skim through paying five ten dollars an hour whatever it is and just skim through these videos really quickly and you'll still be making a ton of money so that about wraps it up for the video I hope you got something out of this I really wanted to give you guys examples of business models that you can actually build and scale and be profitable over time now for the entrepreneurs watching this who know a good thing when they see it I know what you're going to do tomorrow you're going to get started on one of these and you're going to give it a go most of these don't require any money to get started so there's no excuse just get started and give it a go as I mentioned earlier in the video I'm actually thinking of doing a case study on one of these business models and showing you guys over the shoulder me building one of these businesses from scratch and showing you results after a week or two if a case study like that sounds interesting to you please hit down below and let me know I'm looking to do some more videos like that in the future so I just want to hear it if you guys want it I'll make it if you like content like this I post at least three times a week with ar entrepreneurship focused content so if you're into that please subscribe hit the Bell so you're notified when the next one drops if you enjoyed the video please leave a like if you like this video I've actually dropped the video a few days ago talking about how I built an AI startup in eight minutes which at GPT which I think is an awesome video got a great reception but if you haven't seen that already it's going to be on the next screen after this so you can click through to that but please check it out it's a great video If you enjoyed this one please subscribe please like but that's all for today thank you so much for watching all the best to you as you navigate this our Gold Rush I'll see you next time"

across the world right now are scrambling for a way to start building AI businesses however finding a place to start is not always easy if you have clicked on this video you're likely an entrepreneur who knows a life-changing opportunity when you see one the AI Gold Rush is upon us well you're in the right place because in this video I'm going to be telling you exactly the system I've created to help entrepreneurs build AI businesses with multiple millions of dollars with chat GPT in under 10 minutes so please don't go anywhere I'm going to be showing you the step-by-step process that you can create an AI business to make your Millions within this gold rush in just 10 minutes with chat GPT I've spent hours preparing this video for you guys to learn the exact strategy that I'm using to create AI startups in just 10 minutes using chat GPT so you do not want to go anywhere don't skip this video watch to the very end because there's some serious value being dropped for entrepreneurs out there looking to make money let's get started but before we get started my name is Liam Motley I've been doing online business since 2018 I'm a self-made serial online entrepreneur I've traveled all over the world and I'm now based in Dubai on this channel I focus on bringing you AI focused content for entrepreneurs like me who are looking to get started and get building businesses in the AI Gold Rush so if that kind of content interests you hit down below subscribe to the channel drop a like if you haven't already it really helps my channel and if you have any questions be sure to comment down below and I'll be answering those too ah you're an entrepreneur excited about the AI opportunity but lack the technical skills to get involved yourself thankfully tools like chat GPT provide you with the platform you need to build businesses on top of their existing model through access to the API and on top of that they give you a new business creation interface never before seen that does not require you to create any code yourself as someone who spent most of 2022 learning full stack development and teaching myself data science and machine learning with python this is a huge leap in technology and ability for entrepreneurs I have been blown away by the level of ml script writing that chat CPT is able to do and just playing around with this it had saved me hours and hours where I would normally be spent searching documentation everywhere to try and figure out every little parameter that needs to go into the code it just knows it and autofills it itself long story short whatever your understanding of coding email scripts you're going to be able to join in and build businesses just like I'm about to show you what we're going to be doing today is called fine tuning a model and the model we're going to be fine-tuning is chat GPT fine tuning is a process of providing additional training data to expand the functionality of a model openai thankfully has docs explain explaining exactly how you can do this and even better chat gbt already knows these documentation and knows how to do it for you in order to fine tune a model you need to have a set of data that you can give to a model like chat GPT to expand its functionality the most important job of us as AR entrepreneurs is to find these sources of data that we can feed into the models thankfully there are a number of places online where you can find huge data sets to train your own version of chat CPT on today we'll be getting our data sets from a website called kaggle please note that not all data sets on kaggle are free for commercial use so before you do any of this yourself please make sure that the data set you're using is free for commercial use and if not you may need to contact the owner and request to buy a license from them so here on screen we're going to head to kaggle here you can see on kaggle you're going to need to create an account we're just going to sign in here with Google and here we are signed in in order to find a data set let's head to the data set section and have a look around for some interesting data we could train our model on for example Apple iPhone sold in India I can't think of any Market big enough off the top of my head that would be interested in buying this as a model as a service here we have one NBA players performance now if we head down here we have a look at the data and what we have we have assists turnovers blocks files so basically a ton of player data from the MBA in uh in the 2019 to 2020 season okay let's take a look at the scoring data we have games played game started minutes per game points per game and a ton of other stuff here so this is looking quite good we have the player name the team name the position two things stand out to me already there's so many people interested in the NBA to begin with but there's also people bidding on the NBA to make money this gives me two large markets of people that are interested in this topic and one that is financially invested in it what we're going to be doing here is taking the scoring data putting it into chat GPT by fine-tuning it so that we have a end model that understands all of the data from the 2019 to 2020 season the end result is a chat GPT version that we can ask about the 2019-2020 season we will be able to say hey who were the top three scorers that had at least 15 field goals in the 2019-2020 season who were centers you can get that specific this is going to allow us to have a conversational dialogue with chat CPT as you do in your own work but specialized in this basketball season to get started we're going to download the scoring data we're going to head over to Google Sheets to have a look at this data and see what the columns are you can input your data through the file section and head to import and then upload your data now we can have a look at the structure of our data we've got the player position team and a ton of scoring data on each player which is great and now the fun begins we are asking chat GPT to fine-tune a version of chat GPT using our MBA scoring data in order to fine-tune chat GPT you're going to need a set of prompts and completion here in the fine-tuning documentation you'll see you need it in this Json format prompt completion prompt completion and here in the prompt text needs to be the question and here in the completion is the answer that you wanted to give thankfully Church EBT can help us out with us I've got this prompt written up here I have a CSV file with MBA scoring data can you please write five let's make that 50 example prompts using only the information I have from data points in my CSV to fine tune chat GPT with here are the column names and I've put the column names and an example of how I want it structured this is going to give us 50 example prompts to fine-tune our model on foreign now we have 50 perfect prompts to fine tune our model with using only the data we have in those columns we provided so I'm going to head over here and paste these in to a separate document to save for later so I'm just going to clean this data up a little bit by removing a column which is just the index and then I'm going to remove all of the blanks by filtering it nothing complex but we need to tidy it up a bit before we put it back into chat GPT remove the blanks and then download as CSV now that we have the CSV we're going to open it up now all about it is in comma separated values that chat GPT can understand we're going to copy this and bring it back to chat gbt and say and there we go I'll put all of our data into church GPT and CSV form because chat GPT has a limited amount of space in each prompt I've had to break this into two so first I've said here is all my MBA data and CSV format are you able to read it put all the CSV data yes I'm able to read the CSV data great and I said from this data I need you to return both the prompt and completion for each of the following prompts M gave all the prompts that they gave me previously I need it in the format as described in the open AI documentation for fine-tuning chat gbt only return the following line per prompt written above and I've given the format from the documentation and here we have it prompt completion prompt completion prompt who is the player with the most games played this season completion Luca Dawn church is the player with the most games played this season with 19 games played and it's given them for all of them so this obviously isn't enough data but you can paste this out into a separate document and continue to do the process over and over and over again with more prompts now I actually ran into a little bit of an issue here because Chachi PT is trained on all the data it only goes up to 2021's data so some of the documentation and these when you're doing development projects like this the documentation that it knows is not the most up-to-date documentation now there's a tricky workaround that I use to get around issues like this this is when I use a jailbreaking method that I know to get around this limitation of chat GPT on screen here you can see me teaching chat GPT the new documentation for open ai's fine tuning I am going to teach you the latest information from open air documentation right regarding how to fine tune chat GPT using their CLI so here you can see I go through and I copy and paste the exact fine tuning documentation from their website into chat GPT and say hey reply to me saying affirmative if you understand the content affirmative documentation part 2 affirmative so chattybt now understands the fine-tuning documentation most up-to-date version from openai themselves now that it understands the documentation I've told it to take the prompt and completion data that we got earlier in the video and write a script that uses it to fine-tune chat GPT here it gives me all the information of how to do it within my command line to show you how to do this I'm just going to pop into vs code quickly and you can use the terminal within vs code to run these commands first off you need a pip install the open AI Library you need to get your open AI Key by heading to your openai account second you need to head to your API keys and create a new key that you can use and paste them to your terminal following these instructions here on screen then we need to take all of this prompt data that we've got from previously in the video and take it over to vs code and create a new data.json file either in the Json format or as I've done it you can do it in the Json L format which is the preferred version for chat GPT as you can see this is just a pair of curly brackets with the prompt in between and pretty typical Json notation once you have all your data in a file like this you then need to run the command open AI create fine tunes interacting with the terminal to get this done is pretty straightforward once you have the Json file you need to tell it to use this data and format it correctly which will create the format of Json L file and then it will take that Json L file and fine-tune the model for you it'll ask you to insert your open AI key so make sure you use the export keyword there now that I have my fine tune model I asked it to create me a basic GUI to interact with the fine tune model all it needs is a field to enter a prompt and a submit button and the area to show the result and just like that chat GPT gave me a script that I can put into vs code and run on my terminal to interact with the new fine tune model that I've made I did have a few little issues with chat GPT not understanding this the format in which the the Callback would come as you can see on screen here this is the format in which chat GPT will return the completion inside this Json object all we want is this little text string here so chat GPT wasn't aware that it would be split back in this format so I sent it the the format and it was like okay I understand that now let me update the script to work with that format and thus I have the final script that I've tested and works great up top here is the name of my model which can be found in your terminal after you've fine-tuned your model so make sure you copy that and enter the model name Chachi PT here is an on-submit function that it's going to use when I create the button and enough talking I'm just going to show you what it actually looks like when you run it python main.pi is the function to run the script and here we have on screen a fine-tuned chat GPT window that is running python within this box here I can interact with chat GPT as I normally would but I can also get the benefit of all the fine-tuned data that I've already fed into it so here if I say who has the highest free throw percentage submit Stephen Curry has the highest free throw percentage with 90.9 and under 10 minutes we've got chat EBT to build us a fine tune version of itself that we can begin to start selling and building a million dollar business with now I can ask those questions like who is the highest field goal percentage who has the highest free throw percentage who are the top three best scorers in the league who are the top three best Etc so because we've only trained this with about 20 different prompts and completions this is not going to be some revolutionary NBA Mastermind here what this is is a glimpse into what you can do with chat GPT by fine-tuning it for other purposes in order to make this into a real valuable business all you need to do is rinse and repeat this process and build this Json L file into a huge compendium of questions and answers done from chat cpt's own prompts if I was going to move forward with this I will get someone off upwork or I would hire one of my friends and I would say I need you to go through and ask chat GPT for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of prompts and then feed it all that data and ask it for all of the completions for it if you can give it a comprehensive understanding of prompt and completions then it will become smarter and smarter and smarter this is just such a limited batch of data that it only shows you a small glimpse of what's possible with this but if you're smart enough you'll see the value and the potential that lies in this method heading back to the MBA data we have assists turnover blocks files minutes rebounds and steals that we still haven't used yet if we were to take with that data and put it into the spreadsheet and extend it many many more columns to include all that other data we could then feed that and CSV format back into chat GPT just as we did before only this time it has tons more data to work with if you combine this additional data with adding thousands and thousands of prompts and completions to your fine tuning data set you've just created a potentially extremely valuable AI tool for people interested in basketball who are betting or just watching along so to recap what we've done in this video is found a free data source from kaggle taking that data over the chat GPT got it to understand the columns and then fed it in all the CSV data so it understood our spreadsheet use chat GPT to turn all that data into a list of prompt and completion pairs that we can then use to fine-tune our model with fourth we have to get around chat gpt's limited knowledge set by getting the most recent documentation from open ai's website but and teaching it through the chat prompts fifth we got to give us instructions and a script on how to fine tune our model using this data and finally put that script into vs code ran it through the terminal and got our own fine-tune chat GPT App working on our computer if you've been following along and using the same prompts I'm sure you've been able to get this done in just a number of minutes this is the incredible ability of chat GPT to help you create AI startups I'm going to continue playing around with this and looking for different data sets that I can use to make my own businesses let me know down below what kind of businesses you're looking to create with keg with data sets and any tips and tricks you can share with the community down below that about wraps it up for the video thank you so much for watching I can't wait to hear about the stuff you guys get done with this tool please

              "text": "because everyone's so hyped about this and we all know this those are the kinds of moves in business that we will see in the next five to ten years that I find much more exciting and trying to figure out how to play in that space my guess is the next hype cycle the next bubble cycle in Silicon Valley will absolutely be this generative AI business in the field like start building come to open AI whatever you just like get like don't don't miss out on this one like just go speed no with the insane reception to the launch of chat GPT the AI industry is heating up and is a perfect time for entrepreneurs to strike it rich just like in the.com smartphone and crypto bubbles of the past few decades each created new generations of billionaires and AI is set to do the same the best thing is that if you're watching this video right now you have the perfect opportunity to make the most of this bubble and get rich with hype comes risk and this AI boom will not last forever so in this video I'm going to be explaining why AI is the next tech bubble the best thing things you can be doing right now to make the most of this super cycle where I see the millions being made in the coming years and finally some pitfalls all entrepreneurs should be aware of before launching their AI startup before we get started my name is Liam Whatley I'm a self-made entrepreneur from New Zealand now living in Dubai here on this channel I create content for fellow entrepreneurs sharing my thoughts on the biggest opportunities for them to get rich making great valuable businesses if you don't want to miss my next video please hit down below subscribe and hit that Bell if you want to be notified when it drops while you're down there please leave a like and if you've got any questions leave a comment I'll be replying to all comments as soon as I can now let's dive into how you can profit from the AI bubble before it's too late speculative bubbles are a byproduct of the capital system we live in today examples of speculative bubbles go back as far as the 1600s during the Dutch golden age when bubbles of tulips skyrocketed ridiculous levels before promptly crashing back down to nothing more recently we've seen the.com smartphone and crypto bubbles form each creating a new generation of billionaires in their tracks Mark Cuban is an entrepreneur notable for his appearances on Shark Tank but beyond that he was a hugely successful entrepreneur during the.com era he exited on his company broadcast.com for a billion dollars what did the company do put the radio on the internet as basic as that you saw an opportunity and said hey we have this new platform called the internet this new platform called the World Wide Web which is actually what caused the.com bubble all this money came in BC attention Etc and he said hey this is the opportunity I'm going to jump on and he wrote it sold it to Yahoo for a billion dollars in Yahoo stock hedged it and walked away with the rest so what is a bubble and how do they form typically bubbles form due to a new innovation that draws a ton of attention from VCS and entrepreneurs alike and causes a rush to the new opportunities this is exactly what we're seeing right now with AI the launch of chat GPT recently has opened the eyes of entrepreneurs and VCS alike to this new Rush of Technology this is nothing like people have ever seen and this is going to change every industry we know the most beautiful thing about bubbles for entrepreneurs like me and you is that it is the easiest time to make money during this AI super cycle money will be thrown at ridiculous businesses for any reason while VCS and investors try to get in on these new ideas this is a free-for-all for you to run in and grab any idea you want slap the name AI in it and then try to get funding for it obviously we want to try to build good businesses but it's a metaphor for just how easy things will be in this compared to times previously where there was not much attention on AI so if you want to be the mark Cubit of Our Generation you need to be looking around and trying to find the next AI business that you're going to get into and launch your startup now but what's the best way to get amongst it how can you get exposure to the AI industry and the newest hottest things happening right now so we've identified a bubble but how can you be making the most of things right now so that you can set yourself up and make money in this coming wave of new investment and opportunity you need to be joining subreddits discords following people on Instagram finding YouTubers that you really like down below to submerge yourself in this new wave of Technology you need to be joining subreddits and getting amongst discussions join open ai's Discord and start seeing who's there start making connections you need to be in these places where the action is going on YouTube is another great resource find YouTubers you like find videos that are having hot takes on where they think the industry is going what business opportunities they see there are going to be people that are incentivized on YouTube to be given away gold in exchange for your views furthermore you need to be using tools like chat CPT and Jasper daily get in there and start learning how to get the best out of those tools there's going to be a new skill required by employers that is specialized and not many people are getting into right now which is knowing how to use these chat Bots knowing how to interact with these models to get the best out of them for different tasks doing things like pasting in a ton of information and using that to pre-train the model in some way like these are the things you need to be aware of you need to get so in depth and understand the communities around it the actors what's going on and how to get the most out of these models right now in their in their beta forms of fish the real value is finding non-obvious sources of data that feed it so it's all about training you need to be getting amongst it right now and figuring out who are the people I should be listening to where are the sources of information who can I get in touch with and network with and how can I be getting the most out of these models so you need to get amongst that and if you're not going to do it someone else will how can you be an entrepreneur in the space and not be familiar with these tools regularly watching content on it and being in touch with the communities now I've identified the bubble and you've got amongst it what's next what I believe will be the low-hanging fruit for entrepreneurs getting into the AI Revolution we'll be looking at SAS businesses which everywhere right now saturation is peaked on SAS businesses and looking hey how can this SAS business be converted to a mass business a model as a service business we're going to replace SAS with what I call Mass which is models as a service a basic example of a e-commerce product finder which we've seen over and over and over again where can you find data on how these products are selling say you're looking at Amazon product review numbers if you're looking at Alibaba or AliExpress reviews and sales and use them to fine-tune the model if you can find a source of e-commerce sales data for example on AliExpress and seeing how many sales have happened for that product if you can somehow pipe that into a model and train it and say hey these are the products we're selling right now tell me the trends and allow people to interact with that model in a similar way to chat GPT then you can have a great business on your hands that leverages chat gpt's ability but you fine-tuned it to understand what products are selling right now this is the kind of things you need to be thinking about how are there what services are you using right now that you could find a data source for fine tune the model fine-tune chat GPT to sell this as a model and as a service to other people this is what I believe is the lowest hanging fruit there are going to be so many opportunities right now and if you start moving if you start finding where this data is if you can think enough to find hey there is some sources of data here that I can get in contact with I'll email a site and I'll say hey would you be interested in using my machine learning tools and my machine learning staff to train a model and then we can work together on selling this as a model so if you haven't figured out already the data sources are the important thing you need to be keeping a keen eye out for proprietary data for those of you without a ton of capital required to perhaps acquire a website that owns a ton of data and use that all yourself you can go in and offer to partner with these guys and say hey I know what I'm doing I have machine learning Engineers ready to go if you want to partner on this I will show you how it's done so finally pitfalls to avoid as an entrepreneur moving into these model as a service businesses and moving into the AI Revolution hoping to create a valuable startup firstly regulation is going to affect many industries that are trying to be revolutionized by AI this is most notably difficult in the areas that interact with the real world for example with Tesla's self-driving cars uh yes they're doing a great job but there is a huge gap between where they are and where they need to be and that is because they're interacting with the real world using these models that are purely uh contained within the digital realm and they're just giving you checks back they're giving your answers back that is much easier than trying to tackle anything that interacts with the real world you should be trying to avoid those at all costs yes there may be more valuable businesses but I take it you're not already a billionaire so I would be going for businesses that are purely digital that do not have a real world element that can affect their path to regulation the purely digital tools will most likely not need to be regulated but as soon as you're interacting in the real world like Tesla's with self-driving cars there was a ton of work to do to make it work in the first place but also it's a question of does this industry have regulatory Pathways set up to allow you to get it to regulation as the cases with Tesla self-driving cars no one really knows whose job that is however in the health industry there's clear Pathways to FDA approval so you need to be well aware of that before you get into any industry real key is where do you find proprietary sources of data that you can learn on top of that's the real arms race and finally if you haven't got it from the name bubbles eventually burst and everything comes crashing down thankfully bubbles don't typically form around a completely rubbish bit of Technology but it would definitely go up and fall back down to a normal level as we've seen with cryptocurrencies in the past year if what goes up must eventually come down but you need to make your money on the way up and we've just started this AI has just started to kick off you need to move fast you need to do what I've been saying in this video get amongst it get in all these communities start watching more YouTube videos start your own YouTube channel if you're doing all these things there is no way in my mind that you will not find at least one low-hanging fruit that you can get started on time is on your side now but it won't be forever you need to move fast so that about wraps it up I hope you've got a lot out of this video and I hope you're keeping your eyes out now for areas that you can find data and start converting that data into a valuable fine-tuned model to sell as a service if you have any questions please leave a comment down below I'll be answering all comments and I really hope you guys got a lot out of this video if you like the kind of content to make on this channel and haven't already subscribed please do so below and leave a like while you're at it it really really helps my channel grow so my name is Liam Motley thank you so much for

              "text": "chat GPT is on everyone's lips right now and for good reason current AI services like chat gbt are a first look at a new chapter of human productivity and an enormous shift in the way we access information with such power comes great possibilities but also some threats to our species thankfully Bots like chat GPT have created an explosion of new ways to make money online that likely won't be around for long so in this video I'm going to be covering Seven online business opportunities that anyone can get into using chat GPT and openai please note that many of these opportunities are Arbitrage opportunities meaning there's an imbalance in the marketplace right now that will eventually be equalized if you want to make any money with these new tools you need to move quickly before the market forces at play and the big players come in and soak up all the difference leaving you with nothing left so you're going to want to watch to the very end of this video because I've got some methods in here to make money online with chat gbt that I haven't seen anywhere on YouTube yet but before we get started my name is Liam Motley I'm a self-made serial entrepreneur I've been doing online business since 2018 and traveled all over the world and are now based in Dubai so if you're an aspiring or established entrepreneur looking to make money in this AI boom cycle check down below and subscribe to my channel I'm gonna be brand new content regularly three times a week and while you're at it please drop a like it really helps me on the YouTube algorithm opportunity number one SEO blog post writing posting on medium and quora this in my opinion is the quickest and most efficient way for people who are yet to make money online to get stuck into it and be making a few thousand dollars a week if you really work at it the premise of this business model is using chat gbt to write you blog articles that you then post on medium and then over the course you want to as well so you don't have to think up ideas for blog posts anymore and you don't have to write them yourself so this eliminates all the hard work from doing this so you can shortcut what people have been doing and making money for years so starting off you're going to want to head to a keyword research tool like this here word stream and then put in a keyword that you want to build your blog post around I'm choosing YouTube automation you can do affiliate marketing Drop Shipping whatever you don't want to do whatever you think is going to get high searches and fits these criteria I'm about to explain to you below so we've got YouTube automation here it's got a nice high monthly search volume and a low competition this is the key uh area that you want to be in low competition and high monthly searches you can ask for blog titles around that particular keyword put it into chat GPT and it's going to give you a bunch of titles that you can use take that title and then ask for an outline once you've got the outline you get a whole bunch of different things that it wants to put in there the final step to creating your blog post is to put it through a word replacer keeps the same meaning but changes the words so that all of the plagiarized stuff that chat GPT has used to write these articles is then removed and it won't be picked up by medium or quora as plagiarized material once you have the finished article with the words replaced you can then take it over to medium create an account sign up as a Creator which will allow you to get paid for people reading your content post your blog post and then continue to repeat that process over and over and over and over again if I was gonna do it I would hire someone on upwork for a few dollars an hour train them on this process and just start pumping this out like crazy you're also able to create account on quora and head over there and post them in the same manner and get paid using their program now if you're really smart you'll figure out ways to squeeze in affiliate links to different uh platform Services products into these articles so not only are you getting paid the uh fees from poorer and medium for posting and being a creator that people are reading your whole articles you can get paid by affiliate affiliate providers and start making even more money secondly you're probably already aware of this but copywriting is a great way to use chapter jpt to make money online I've actually got a video on my channel already that explains to you how I landed a three thousand dollar per month copywriting client through my agency and how you can too so I'm going to put a link here in one of the corners and down below just in case you can't see it uh if you want to go over and check that out it's a great video business number three set up your own video script writing agency YouTube is exploding right now so many people are flooding to the platform as Watchers and creators there are going to be people everywhere in need of good script writers for their videos what you need to do on sites like upwork Fiverr and freelancer.com is list yourself as a video scriptwriter and then attract all sorts of clients from marketing agencies to YouTube creators what you then need to do is take what they're asking for take their brief and put it into chat GPT you're gonna need to learn how to machine this thing to get exactly what you want and it'll split chunks out you need to put it into a document manipulate it but this is an extremely valuable skill that you can charge up for a high rate you can put yourself prices really really low initially get a bunch of good reviews on that site be very fast with your communication and once you've racked up 1050 reviews then you can start charging more by doing this correctly and providing great service to your clients there's no doubt in my mind that you can make your way in this world selling plenty of these video scripts online fourth business idea YouTube automation on steroids if you're not familiar with YouTube automation it's an online business model that's been around for quite a long time now YouTube automation is also called faceless YouTube automation if you choose to not put your face on it so this is a way for people who don't want to be on YouTube like I am here but they just want to make money by getting in on the Creator economy there are people getting millions of views per video without ever showing their face and making thousands of dollars per month and doing so chat GPT can generate you infinite interesting new video ideas on any topic you provide it you just need to keep asking for more you can tweak it and say hey I'd like it a little bit more like this or could you give me some in the in the style of this so you can take your competitors top 10 videos strip all of their their video titles put it into chat GPT and say hey I like these titles this is what my competitors are doing can you please give me other ideas for videos like these this is a great idea in my opinion because it leans into this creative economy that is booming as I've said before more and more people are choosing YouTube over streams of services like Netflix or Hulu or all the other ones more young people are coming to YouTube to watch their content and if you're positioned in the right place you can cash in on this trend and make tons of money with very little work now that you have chat GPT helping you fifth is to create your own content website and get as much traffic as you can to it unlike quora and medium you're posting these on your own website with the intention of growing this website until it gets to a point where it has thousands or millions of monthly visitors you can have ads put on your site and convert these visitors to Dollars sure no doubt had a great YouTube video on this I'm going to leave links to it at the end of this video You're gonna be able to click through to that and explore all the different options I mentioned here so if your website is making five thousand dollars per month from visitors that are being converted into dollars through ads then people are going to be willing to buy that website for a certain amount of money usually 40x multiple is what Sean says so you need to continue to create content and post on this regularly until you can get to the point where you are making a sufficient out of money and you can go and exit on that on that website there are different marketplaces you can use to sell your website once you have a certain amount of visitors and income coming through your site and people are willing to pay money for that so if you continue to build up your team and get multiple sites building at once you can have this opportunity to exit on multiple websites by using chat GPT number six using the lenser model I'm sure many of you familiar with lenzo that took over social media with all the AI anime avatars that just went everywhere on Instagram these were done by a company called Lanza that have used the stable diffusion API to create these amazing images that make people look better than they really look and played a bit on social engineering there to get to get some virality to their marketing so lenza was able to make money by people paying a few dollars to get a picture of themselves back you need to start thinking how you can use these existing insane resources to create businesses and sell these Services someone used the example of people wanting to see what their dreams look like in art form and people say hey my dream is like this and this and this okay I'll make that art for you they go on to stable diffusion and give it all the prompts Lanza was able to do it incredibly well because they used social media marketing to explode their business and get tons of people downloading their app so have a think about how you can use these existing image-based tools to create images and create art where you can sell them and what's more try to build a platform like Linda did that allows people to interact with it and if you're really really smart try to create some sort of marketing and informality Loop in there too finally number seven when what I think is the biggest opportunity for entrepreneurs at the moment is to fine tune your own model openai allows you to fine-tune the chat GPT model to whatever you would like it to do all you need to do is have a data set and feed that and using a machine learning engineer which you can get upwork or teach yourself if you really want to get this deep but you can take a big data set and pipe it into the chat GPT model and fine tune it to be better at what you do than the original model was this is where huge businesses will be made taking the existing knowledge and incredible ability of chat GPT but tailoring it more to a specific purpose than it was originally intended for so smart entrepreneurs will be looking for data sources they can get their hands on to train the chat EPT model for a different purpose once this model has been fine-tuned you're then able to sell it as a service to people real estate agents or homeowners who want to know the best way to title their real estate listings to ensure it sells quick and for the highest value possible something so simple like this could definitely be sold to real estate agents if you get a partnership with someone or if you're just marketing directly through uh social media or Google ads in a few days I'm going to be releasing my video on how this model as a service boom will happen what I think my thoughts and where I'm looking to make most money in this coming boom I know what it's like if you're just starting out as an online entrepreneur it can be very difficult to finally push yourself over the edge and actually get started and dive in seriously there has never been an easier time that I've seen to get started making money online the entire workplace is going to shift around the market is going to adapt to these new tools and if you are not making money now they are going to be gone I'm going to be posting even more content like this uh my thoughts on the AI Revolution and more business models that I see so make sure you go down below subscribe drop a like for me please it really helps my channel and drop a comment if you enjoyed the content if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them down below my name is Liam Motley and best of luck for you as you navigate through this AI gold rush I'll
